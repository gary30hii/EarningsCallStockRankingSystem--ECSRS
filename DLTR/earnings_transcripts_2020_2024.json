At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Guiler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Britney. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2019. On today's call will be CEO, Gary Philbin; Enterprise President, Mike Witynski; and CFO, Kevin Wampler. \n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent 8-K, 10-Q and annual report, which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so. \n In the fourth quarter, the company incurred several discrete charges as described below: a 1 -- a $313 million noncash charge for goodwill impairment; a $24.6 million reduction in tax expense for the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the company's foreign net operating loss carryforwards; an $18 million charge to the litigation reserve; and a $0.3 million acceleration in noncash deferred financing costs associated with the debt prepayments. These items are detailed in the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all margin, net income and earnings comparisons presented today exclude the impact of these discrete charges from the fourth quarter and fiscal year. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n Now I will turn the call over to Gary Philbin, Dollar Tree's Chief Executive Officer. \nGary Philbin: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our team's accomplishments in fiscal 2019, including the successful consolidation of our store support centers, the material acceleration of the family Dollar store optimization program and the initial launch of our Dollar Tree Plus! initiative. For Q4, despite the compressed holiday shopping season, with 6 fewer days between Thanksgiving, Christmas, we delivered positive same-store sales for the enterprise, while managing margins and costs effectively to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.79, near the top end of our guidance range. \n Fiscal 2019 was an important year for our organization as we further developed the foundation and fundamentals to grow and improve our business. Our accomplishments for 2019 include the following: first, consolidation of our store support center brought the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams together in 1 building. This was a major project and announced in September of 2018 and completed this past July. \n Our working in one space has increased the energy; benefited our culture and driven collaboration, efficiency and teamwork that will enable us to provide even better support to our stores as we move through 2020. Our store support consolidation allowed us to organize our management around the key processes within the company and flattened our organization to accomplish the speed and focus we need to have on key initiatives this year. \n We've made significant progress on the Family Dollar store optimization program, including closing more than 400 stores; rebannering 200 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Trees; and renovating more than 1,100 mature stores at Family Dollar into the H2 format. Third, the Dollar Tree Plus! was introduced around midyear, Mike will provide an update on the initiative, including the details of our Dollar Tree Plus! 2.0 that is being implemented into our test stores this month. \n Fourth, we repurchased 200 million in shares during 2019. In recent years, we have made significant process of paying down debt. We have a scheduled debt payment for $250 million in April 2020, and we currently have an $800 million authorization remaining on our Board repurchase plan. \n Our merchant teams traveled overseas for their annual post-holiday buying trip in January. This trip was led by our enterprise chief merchant. The teams continue to work directly with a diverse group of qualified factories. In fact, we had vendors from 8 other Asian countries that tend our qualifying open buying day. We consider this to be one of our most successful buying trips. We were pleased with the continued support we are receiving from our extended vendor group, and we were able to buy the value in key items and departments for both banners for the 2020 holiday season. \n Importantly, all returned from China healthy and safe despite of the news regarding the outbreak of the coronavirus. \n Let me give you a bit of an update on the coronavirus as it affects our supply chain as we see it today. Our global sourcing group and merchants, along with our logistics team, are meeting daily and updating our progress on visibility to individual purchase orders. Generally, we are seeing production pickup, and factory attendance is increasing each week. Our global sourcing team in China and third parties that provide quality assurance inspections are nearly at normal levels. \n All ports and third-party freight consolidators are open and operating at near-normal levels, and we are getting all needed space on vessels for our freight. At this point, all of our Easter merchandise and lawn and garden seasonal product is in our domestic supply chain, either in distribution centers or flowing to stores. At this point, we see a very small percentage of product canceled and some product moving on to later delivery, usually by a few weeks. And our teams are working to mitigate with sources elsewhere, including domestic sources, to mitigate any effect there. More to come. \n In December, we announced enterprise-level organizational leadership changes to enhance the company's execution of our strategy and to improve performance across the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar business segments. Among the management changes were the promotions of Mike Witynski to Enterprise President; Rick McNeely to Enterprise Chief Merchandising Officer; and Tom O' Boyle to Enterprise Chief Operating Officer. \n These and other actions are designed to increase enterprise-wide focus, efficiencies and accountability. With Mike, Rick and Tom, we now have our senior leadership working together across the company with increased urgency to move the needle on initiatives that will help us deliver bottom line results that will drive value to our shareholders and customers. \n Since joining Dollar Tree in 2010, Mike Witynski has been a key executive and partner in driving performance across the organization. In particular, Mike has had the store excellence, operational initiatives and merchandising programs to drive sales and margin and has been hands-on in managing our tariff mitigation efforts the past 18 months. Mike's promotion to Enterprise President will continue our progression of elevating customer-facing initiatives in merchandising and store operations. \n I'll now turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, enterprise same-store sales grew by 1.8% to -- enterprise sales grew by 1.8% to $6.32 billion. Our consolidated same-store sales increased 0.4%. Both of our segments, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, were negatively impacted by the shortened holiday shopping season. We were also cycling an early release of February SNAP benefits into January a year ago. \n We delivered adjusted EPS of $1.79 for the quarter. Regarding the Dollar Tree segment, sales highlights for the fourth quarter include a 1.4% same-store sales growth, which represented Dollar Tree's 48th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Dollar Tree had increases in both traffic and ticket, with average ticket being slightly outpacing the traffic increase. Geographically, our strongest-performing zones were in the upper Midwest and the Northeast. \n Regarding the cadence of comps to the quarter, December and January were our strongest months. Dollar Tree had positive comps in both consumables and discretionary. We are pleased with the performance of our seasonal business and closeouts for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. Arts and crafts, pet supplies and snacks and beverage were also strong during the quarter. During the quarter, we added Snack Zone to 49 stores, bringing our fiscal 2019 total to 1,002 stores. This surpassed our goal of 1,000 stores for the year. We now have Snack Zones in 2,136 Dollar Tree stores. \n We continue to be pleased with the introduction of our Crafters Square initiative as well. Crafters Square is now in more than 650 Dollar Tree stores and consists of new expanded assortment of arts and craft supplies, all priced at $1. We plan to expand this program to many more Dollar Tree stores later this spring. \n The values are tremendous, and our customers are responding. Using the store locator function at dollartree.com, you can quickly locate the nearest Dollar Tree location with the Crafters Square selection. Please drop by and check it out. \n Now looking at Dollar Tree Plus! We are taking learnings from the first phase and moving into our next phase of development, which we refer to as Dollar Tree Plus! 2.0. Among the elements from our learnings that will be arriving in the test stores later this month include a shift away from consumable items into more discretionary margin-enhancing product mix. Categories will include electronics, toys, health and beauty, craft, seasonal and more. \n We are also updating and improving the in-store design elements to create a more excitement around the program and help deliver -- to help further delineate the $1 product from the multi-priced items. We continue to focus on finding value with our customers will recognize and our assortment will reflect retails at $5 and below. We feel this program will better represent what customers have come to expect from Dollar Tree, extreme value on an array of exciting items. More to come as we continue to learn, evolve and develop our Dollar Tree Plus!\n Regarding Family Dollar segment, sales highlights for the fourth quarter include: up against Family Dollar's toughest quarterly compare from the prior year and a compressed holiday selling season, same-store sales were down 0.8% for the quarter; comps were relatively balanced geographically, with the Western zone delivering a positive comp. \n Regarding cadence of comps to the quarter, both November and December were slightly negative. January, which was cycling the early release of SNAP benefits from a prior year, was our lowest comp month. The consumable side of the business delivered 13 -- delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Importantly, all geographic zones have positive comps and consumable. The performance of discretionary side of our business did not meet our expectations for the quarter, and the performance was relatively the same geographically. Shortly, I will share details on how we are addressing the discretionary business at Family Dollar. \n Now regarding H2. Our customers continue to be excited about the H2 renovations at Family Dollar. In the fourth quarter, H2 stores in their first year are comping at greater than 10% on average. These stores are driving greater loyalty, earning repeat visits and increasing value perception. We are committed to this store format and plan to renovate at least 1,250 Family Dollar stores to the H2 format in fiscal 2020. We began rolling out H2 format in Q3 of 2018. We are pleased that 2/3 of the comp lift is being driven by traffic and especially by the fact that H2s are working in both urban and rural locations. \n As a reminder, in our H2 stores, our efforts to drive performance are focused on creating price impact; highlighting our Family Dollar private brands; offering expanded and frozen food for convenient fill-in trips; expanding immediate consumption for snacks on the run; adding new impulse areas to drive value and margin; and introducing $1 impact section with ever-changing assortments of value, newness and excitement. The customer feedback we are receiving gives us credit across these areas of the store. We continue to refine the discretionary assortments to drive more business in these areas of the store. \n Now regarding the real estate for the enterprise during the quarter. We completed more than 230 projects, including 112 new stores, 17 relocations; 10 rebanners from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree, meeting our goal of 200 for the year; 5 Family Dollar renovations to the H2 format; and 95 closing stores, primarily at the end of the lease term. We ended fiscal 2019 with 15,288 stores. \n Now let me share a few thoughts of our Family Dollar business. I believe our biggest challenge in turning around Family Dollar has been on the discretionary side. Our consumable business is growing well and is driving traffic, improving the performance in the discretionary side of our business, is a key objective of Rick McNeely and his team in 2020. Rick has been a proven leader at Dollar Tree business for more than 15 years. \n I've seen Rick develop and drive key initiatives in seasonal, stationery, party, Snack Zone and most recently in our Craft business over the years at Dollar Tree. I'm confident that Rick and his leadership team will take the same approach with driving our discretionary business at Family Dollar. Rick will bring an unwavering focus on our customer by bringing the right products with the right value at the right price points for her basic needs, price, value and convenience on basic products is critical to our success. \n On the most recent buying trip in January, I've already seen the discretionary import process come to life. Rick brought the same rigor and processes that Dollar Tree has developed over the years for our import business to Family Dollar. The process has started with the customer in mind and delivering on our expected business goals, then Rick and the team dive into the category, the subcategory and the product and price, line by line, item by item. Every item gets scrutinized for value, meeting our customer needs and delivering on our financial goals. \n Now we have 1 leader. We are in the same building on the same floor and going on the same import trips. Rick brings a consistent singular process and voice to both segments of our business. He has an experienced, proven leadership team in place. This allows for sharing insights, moving with speed and leveraging efficiencies with our combined value on specific items and/or shared vendors. Our merchant teams are engaged, energized and equipped to drive the discretionary business at Family Dollar going forward, and I look forward to the change. \n I will now turn to Kevin to provide more detail on the fourth quarter performance and our initial outlook for 2020. \nKevin Wampler: Thank you, Mike, and good morning. Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 1.8% to $6.32 billion, comprised of $3.52 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.8 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 0.4%. And on a segment basis, same-store sales for Dollar Tree increased 1.4% and for Dollar -- Family Dollar decreased 0.8%. Overall, our gross profit was $1.96 billion compared to $1.91 billion in the prior year's quarter. \n Gross margin was 31% of sales compared to 30.8% in Q4 of 2019. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of sales to 36.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter included merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 40 basis points, primarily due to the impact of List 4A tariffs, which represented approximately 65 basis points of headwind. This was partially offset by lower freight costs. Distribution costs increased approximately 25 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. Shrink increased approximately 15 basis points based on unfavorable inventory results and an increase to the accrual rate. And occupancy costs increased approximately 10 basis points based on loss of leverage from the lower comp sales. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 100 basis points to 24.6% during the fourth quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: markdown expense improved approximately 100 basis points as we cycled the $40 million reserve for Q4 of 2018. And merchandise costs, including freight, decreased approximately 60 basis points, driven primarily by improved initial mark-on and freight costs. These were partially offset by a higher percentage of lower-margin consumable sales. These benefits were partially offset by occupancy costs, which increased approximately 35 basis points due to higher real estate taxes and loss of leverage on lower comp sales. Distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increased payroll costs at the DCs, and shrink increased approximately 10 basis points. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses, including discrete charges, were 27.1% of net sales compared to 65.4% of net sales in the prior year's quarter. Excluding the discrete charges in 2019 and 2018, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 21.9% compared to 21.3% in the prior year's quarter. For the fourth quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment, when excluding its portion of the litigation reserve as a percentage of sales, increased to 20.1% compared to 19.7% for the fourth quarter of 2018. This increase was due to the following: payroll cost increased approximately 30 basis points, primarily due to an increase in store hourly payroll due to higher average hourly rates; and additional  output to support store initiatives. Operating cost increased by approximately 10 basis points, resulting from increased debit and credit card fees due to higher penetration and higher insurance costs, and depreciation increased approximately 10 basis points. \n The SG&A rate for Family Dollar segment, when excluding the goodwill impairment and the litigation reserve, increased 20 basis points to 21.5% compared to 21.3% for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to the loss of leverage on negative comp sales. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 15 basis points, and operating expenses increased approximately 10 basis points, resulting primarily due to higher debit and credit card fees and increased insurance costs comparable to Dollar Tree. \n Corporate and support expenses increased 15 basis points, primarily related to higher incentive comp and stock compensation expense compared to the prior year quarter based on timing of performance adjustments between Q3 and Q4 year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, excluding discrete charges for -- from 2019 and 2018, adjusted operating income was $580.4 million compared with $632.6 million in the same period last year, and adjusted operating margin was 9.2% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales in last year's fourth quarter. \n Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $39.9 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 5.1% in Q4 of 2018. These rates are affected by the noncash goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2019 and 2018 that are not tax deductible. Without the goodwill impairment charges included in net profit before tax, the tax rates for Q4 2019 and Q4 2018 were 16.6% and 21.2%. The decrease in Q4 of 2019 rate is a result of a reduction in tax expense of $24.6 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the company's foreign net operating loss carryforwards. \n For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, the company had net income of $123 million or $0.52 per diluted share. This compared to a GAAP net loss of $2.3 billion or a loss of $9.69 per share in the prior year's quarter. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for Q4 2019 were $1.79. Please refer to the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in today's press release. \n Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at fiscal year-end totaled $539.2 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Outstanding debt as of February 1, 2020, was approximately $3.8 billion. The company paid $500 million in January 2020 on its $750 million floating rate note. The remaining $250 million is due April 2020. \n Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 8.4% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 1.2%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the first quarter. \n Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 7.7% from the same period last year and decreased 2.8% on a selling square foot basis. Based on store closures, the Family Dollar segment has 5.1% less square footage outstanding. \n Capital expenditures were $252.5 million in the fourth quarter versus $194.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, capital expenditures totaled $1.035 billion. For fiscal 2020, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures will be focused on 550 new stores and 1,250 Family Dollar H2 renovations. The addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to select existing Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores, IT system enhancements and projects, development of our Chesapeake campus, installation of LED lighting as well as HVAC and flooring replacements in select stores and the completion of construction of our new distribution center in Rosenberg, Texas as well as the start of construction on Dollar Tree regional DC17 and a high-velocity DC. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $179.1 million for the fourth quarter and $166.7 million in fourth quarter last year. For the year, depreciation expense totaled $645 million. \n For fiscal 2020, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $680 million to $690 million. Our initial outlook for fiscal 2020 includes the following assumptions: our outlook does not include any potential impact related to the supply chain or other aspects of the company's business for the COVID-19 coronavirus. For same-store sales, we are forecasting low single-digit positive comps for the year. \n Calendar considerations for 2020 include the following: Easter will be 1 week earlier, which will have an estimated $10 million negative impact on sales in the first quarter; and there will be 2 additional selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 2019, which should positively impact Q4 sales by an estimated $12 million. \n On a GAAP basis, we expect to incur approximately  [ $48 ]  million less in onetime costs in 2020 compared to 2019. This relates to costs in 2019 associated with store closings, markdowns and accelerated rents as well as consolidating our store support centers. \n With regard to tariffs, our outlook includes an estimated $47 million of incremental costs in fiscal 2020, with nearly all of it to be incurred in the first half of the year. \n From a GAAP EPS standpoint, we believe our toughest year-over-year compare will be Q1, as we are incurring incremental tariff cost of approximately $25 million compared to Q1 of 2019. Additionally, we are planning on increased promotional activity for our Family Dollar banner as we rebuild our discretionary merchandise assortment. While our first quarter outlook includes the expected pressure from these tariffs and increased promotional activity, we believe we are well positioned to deliver improved sales, operating margin and earnings in the following 3 quarters and for full year 2020. \n We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets; states increasing minimum wages; unemployment levels, including the company's initiative plans, including H2 renovations, Snack Zones and Crafters Square projects. We continue to partially offset these average hourly rating increases through productivity initiatives in our stores. \n We estimate year-over-year domestic freight cost to be slightly lower in 2020. Import freight rates will be higher as we annualize our April 2019 rate increases. In addition, we expect the new clean fuel regulations for ocean vessels to contribute to higher import rates in 2020. We expect distribution costs to be a headwind during the year from wage pressures created from the tight labor market for both banners and depreciation cost pressure specific to the Dollar Tree segment. We do expect the distribution cost headwinds to dissipate as we go through the year as productivity initiatives positively affect the network. \n Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $38 million in Q1 and approximately $145 million for fiscal 2020. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We've not adjusted our outlook for currency rate changes. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23% for the first quarter and 22.8% for fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 238.1 million shares for Q1 and the full fiscal year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. The company has $800 million remaining under the Board repurchase authorization. \n For the first quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.89 billion to $5.99 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.09. These estimates are based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and year-over-year square footage growth of 1.5%. \n For fiscal 2020, we are forecasting total sales to range between $24.21 billion and $24.66 billion based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and approximately 3.1% selling square footage growth. The company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for fiscal 2020 will range between $4.80 and $5.15. \n And looking at our 2020 outlook, when compared to 2019 performance, the upper end of our 2020 guidance is $5.15. Adding back the impact of $47 million or $0.15 per share in incremental tariffs in 2020 and $28.6 million or $0.12 per share for the equalization of tax rates for both years, brings the adjusted EPS for 2020 at the high end to $5.42. When compared to the 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $4.76, 2020 adjusted earnings of $5.42 would be a 14% increase year-over-year. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Gary. \nGary Philbin: Thanks, Kevin. Work from our teams in 2019 set the stage for us to be able to grow and improve our businesses in 2020. Our teams are able to achieve several important milestones through '19 and mitigate some of the challenges. The time, effort, resource and focus on bringing more than 500 jobs to Chesapeake, Virginia by consolidating our store support centers; the Family Dollar store optimization effort to close more than 400 stores and rebanner another 200; the doubling of H2 renovation projects from 518 to more than 1,119; all the tariff mitigation efforts regarding trade during the year; and the impact last year to our balloon and party business from the helium shortage. \n Here's the good news for 2020. Our management team is in one place, with our senior leadership, focusing on the priorities and initiatives to drive the business. Our management team is tapped to do the following: as always, drive our top line with exciting merchandising execution; improve on shrink; drive supply chain efficiencies, both in freight and distribution costs; improve the mix on the discretionary side of Family Dollar, creating more value; reinvent the WOW of Dollar Tree, as always, with our new drive the business opportunities that you heard Mike describe and Dollar Tree Plus! continue our tariff mitigation on each buying trip and the continued refinements to drive the H2 format this year and next. Our customers are responding to the store layout and assortment and price impact. Our teams are focused and energized and well prepared for 2020. \n As we start Q1, we have seen our customers at Dollar Tree respond to our first big seasonal holiday, Valentine's Day. Helium was in good supply, and certainly not the issue we had last year. We had a terrific holiday, with sales, traffic and positive comps in our party department. \n For Family Dollar, we have been focused on tax refund time to drive our business into departments that our customer spends on this time of the year. We have increased promotional activity during this important time. And we are at the peak of it right now and like the traffic we are seeing across those departments. All this progress will not be possible without the contributions of each and every one of our associates. For them, in more than 15,200 stores across the U.S. and Canada, our network of 24 distribution centers and our store support center in Chesapeake, Virginia, I'd like to just add my thanks to all of them for their ongoing commitment, dedication and efforts to serve our customers every day. Our efforts in 2020 are focused on the urgency around our key initiatives to drive bottom line results in supply chain, our continued progress on H2 store renovations, shrink, elevating training at field and store level for increased customer engagement. \n In summary, we are -- we continue to focus and make meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both brands. We are well positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increase value for our shareholders. The combination of more than 15,200 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers in all types of markets. Our teams are excited about seizing the opportunities in tackling the challenges ahead of us in 2020. \n Operator, we're now ready for questions. \nOperator: Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So maybe just to start off. At the Dollar Tree concept, what do you attribute if we take a step back, the roughly 100 basis points of gross margin contraction, the last 2 years? And as I break it down, what I'm trying to figure out is how much do you see as transitory or recapture opportunity? Do you feel comfortable that the consumable mix pressure is now in the rearview mirror? And I guess, to put it all together, multiyear, what do you think is the sustainable gross margin at the Dollar Tree banner versus that 35% to 36% pretty consistent historical level? \nKevin Wampler: Sure, Matt. This is Kevin. Thank you for the question. Again, I think, obviously, moving pieces in the last couple of years. And I think, obviously, most recently, tariffs this year, obviously, have been a headwind, which, obviously, will fully cycle as we go through the year. The team continues to work to mitigate and do everything we can to provide great value to our consumer through that process. I think the other thing, if you look at our mix, our mix at Dollar Tree continues to be good. \n I think, obviously, there's been some things outside of the actual product cost at the end of the day. So if you look at distribution costs, you look at shrink, some items that traditionally, we've been very good at controlling, and we can be very good in the future as we go forward as well. I think those are the items that we have to work on. I think the -- but overall, the consumable and discretionary business, we feel very good about where we're at. \nGary Philbin: Matt, Gary. I would just say this. Long term, we've always been between 35% and 36%,  and that's what we're going to get back to and operate within those ranges. And I mean, you nailed it. The transitory issues have been tariff, distribution, freight, shrink. Those are all the things that I think the longer we are able to navigate around them, we'll be able to see them go away and some effort on each buying trip as if tariffs stay in place, we mitigate them. \n The mix, I'm pleased with. We've seen, despite the fact that we always drive traffic in that Snack Zone, our customers are really going to be excited about Crafter Square. And that's the other side of the margin equation that we've always done at Dollar Tree. So it's always a 1, 2 step with us. And I think we get back to the 35%, 36% for Dollar Tree. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then just to switch gears to Family Dollar. So as we think about the cadence of the year, do you see comps in the positive low single digits in the first quarter? Or is it more a back-end loaded type of a trajectory this year? And what exactly is driving the elevated promotional activity to start the year at Family Dollar? \nKevin Wampler: Yes, Matt. I think we do look for positive comps in each quarter of the year. We do look for the business to get stronger as we go. We will cycle some red tag sales from our stores that we were closing last year. So we have a little higher hurdle from that as we go. But I think that will be fine. So I think that's -- from that perspective, we would expect positive as we go through the year. \nGary Philbin: The other piece, Matt, is we'll be building up on H2s as we go through the year as well. And regarding the promotional activity, I would just tell you, we knew there was a shortened holiday season for the Christmas season. And we just went into this year knowing that while we're going to be cycling some of the red tag event, we also really got to get after the discretionary side of our business at Family Dollar. And tax time last year, I think we just had an opportunity to build on. It's when our customer has money in her pocket. It's what she's shopping the store for things that she does always have money for. And it shows up in bedroom, bathroom, kitchen items that are basically the capital expenses for her for the beginning of the year. So we want to go into this season with really loaded with the right items, what we think is the appropriate promotional activity in Q1 during this important tax time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes with BofA Global Research. \nRobert Ohmes: I guess, I want to just follow-up a little bit on the Family Dollar strategy. I mean it sounds great with Rick McNeely very focused on getting the discretionary going. But can you give us how should we think about the long-term outlook for Family Dollar, if discretionary does continue to underperform? Can you still get the gross margin up or the profit contribution up? \n And also the weakness at Family Dollar from a same-store sales perspective, is there any pressure you're seeing from all those Dollar general stores that have opened over the last couple of years as well? \nGary Philbin: Robby, this is Gary. Listen, I don't think it's either/or. I mean the same way that at Dollar Tree, we've always gone after what you do to drive the business. That tends to be on the consumable side of the store. And then what do you have to do that is on the customer maybe want list instead of needs list. So what Rick brings to it is that process. And our strategy is very clear. We're speaking with one voice, not just to our people, but also to the trade, which goes a long way. And a lot of the discretionary business is things that we can import, the things that we can drive the business on because we invent the product. \n Yes, our customers need basics, but when you get to the seasons, when you get to cook out time, when you get to celebrations, we're introducing Hallmark cards into Family Dollar this year. You heard us talk an awful lot about that over the last 18 months at Dollar Tree in the same kind of card assortment, slightly different, will be into Family Dollar stores as well. And even if it's in consumables, I think it's important to just point out maybe what's different at Family Dollar is our private brand business. \n And while it's,  \"a consumable,\" it's a higher-margin category across all of our own private brands. So that's something that we drive as well. Our immediate consumption is also a consumable, a snack, a drink. Those also are above-average margin. So those are the things that Rick is going to bring to the party. \n And then like all good retailers, we have competitors out there. And what we like about H2 is the lift we've been getting with the format has typically been in places where we don't see because we have that kind of competition out there. So that's why we're happy with the H2 lift as we go into 2020. \nRobert Ohmes: That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Kevin, thanks for getting us to that $5.42 base sort of number for this year when you have everything back. What algorithm should we use for that $5.42 sort of adjusted number for this fiscal year? \nKevin Wampler: Yes. I think when we think about it long term, Robby, is, obviously, we've got a lot of noise in the number the last couple of years with various charges and onetime discrete costs and so forth. But on a general basis, my viewpoint would always be, we're going to look to grow our bottom line faster than top line. And I think we're always looking to say, can -- we want to grow 10% plus on our EPS. It is always the way we're going to look at it. And I think, historically, we've been able to do that. I think we're going to get back to that as we go forward. And while we don't traditionally use an algorithm per se, that's just how I think about it from a metric standpoint. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: It's Simeon Gutman. My first question is improving discretionary at Family Dollar, can you talk about what hasn't been working? And I think on the call, you mentioned that the food and consumables were growing or were positive? Does that mean that 2/3 of the business is comping positive? And any other color on that, please? \nGary Philbin: Simeon, well, I think you've teed it up. The priority for us is to go after the discretionary business at Family Dollar. We've been happy with the consumables because it's been driving the traffic. But like I said before, you got to do both. So what's not working? We can spend a lot of time on that. But I think it's more about our process. It's about the value we bring to our customers as being in stock on the right items and the right store. It's inventing what's new. \n I think sometimes we fall into the trap. This is a customer that counts on Family Dollar for basics, without a doubt. You've got to be right on that. You've got to be ready on 1st of month. You've heard me say we got 13 holidays at Family Dollar, 12 1st of the month and the extra ones, the tax refund time. But that also means we got foot traffic in the store and the ability for us to find the right items in apparel, on seasonal, on electronics, on toys, those are the type of things that need value, the marketing behind it, the price-value equation, promotional activity. And really, those are the things that I think between Mike and Rick and the team at Family Dollar are very focused on right now to build this up. And I don't know another way of doing it, Simeon, other than going 4 feet by 4 feet across a store or when we're over in Asia, going through our items. We go through a SKU at a time and say what are we buying? What's the value equation? What's in the marketplace? And that's always been our process. So it's about that as much as it's about the item. \nSimeon Gutman: And I assume it's iterative. But is there a point in 2020 in which you have your best foot forward for some of the buying that you mentioned in Asia? Some of the new items? New resets? When do you have that offering in place to be able to judge if some of the new stuff is working? \nGary Philbin: Well, on a seasonal basis, we get a grade at the end of every season. So that part is sort of easy. Now as many guys sort of go back and reboot for the next year on what I would consider some of the basics on imports. So we -- but we can accomplish if you've been into an H2 on the impulse tables on our queuing line on some of the basics there every day. \n There, we have a chance either to do resets in some of the categories, which might need a major reset or to put in some impulse items that we can tap. So  you'll be iterative as we go through the year, both on -- both of those parallel paths, what are we doing across the categories and what are we doing from an in-and-out basis on some of the impulse categories --  it's not -- now unlike what we do at Dollar Tree, but different from the standpoint that there will be items, some at $1, but we have an opportunity to sell to customer here the things that she -- maybe at the end, that was on our list that's something cool at $5. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: So Gary, let me start. In the H2 remodels, what type of discretionary comp lift are you getting, number one? And then number two, when you think about Family Dollar real estate, what are the thoughts right now in additional store closings and/or conversions? Or are you -- where you think you want to be right now? \nGary Philbin: Well, for the H2 on those -- the lift that we're getting, which we've called down around 10%, it's basically going up with the same way the fleet is. So which I think is a pretty good effort because keep in mind, what we've added in are additional frozen food doors, which fits a consumable line and expands that offering. We've also putting a queuing line that is a bit more of a mix of both discretionary. But the fact that we've sort of -- if you go back to last year, we were talking about a slightly negative impact from the discretionary. \n As we've gone through the year, we basically have gotten it to the fleet average. The issue is we need to improve the fleet average. And so part of that is what we're going to do across the entire chain, not just H2. But H2 is built to expand margins. We have put in the WOW tables. We have the opportunity with a queuing line. We have private label primarily displayed in the H2s in a bigger way. We got immediate consumption out there, like I said before, is at a higher margin. So those are the things that, over time, I'm counting on H2 to continue to drive the expansion as we go through our continued refinements of H2. \n And the second question, John? \nJohn Heinbockel: Yes, real estate at Family Dollar, right? Do you need to do more closures beyond what you've done this year? And would it be helpful to do more rebannerings? \nGary Philbin: Well, we've always taken a look at what's it take to stay within the fleet in terms of top line sales, cash contribution. I think last year, what we were able to accomplish with the 400 closings was just get the stores that weren't going to get a lift because, in some cases, too small or the town had shifted, all the various reasons that we called out at the time. Yes, I think we take a look at the end of -- basically a lease term, and we take a look at the future of the store. \n Our guidance calls out something -- I would say, history says, between 75 and 90. I think we've put in over 100 this year on closings, and I think that reflects the continued really taking a look at all the stores and what it takes to stay within our store base as we continue to do and get better lifts on our remodels. Our fleet will change. We will have more and more stores be 5 years less -- 5 years or less, since they've been touched last through the new stores, H2 renovations, what we've closed, what we've rebannered. So our customer at Family Dollar is going to see a different fleet of stores. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Just, Kevin, just wondering if you could amplify on the complexion of the operating margins in 2020, both at the Tree and at Family. Just kind of what you're expecting by banner. I know there's obviously the tariff and the ocean freight, which looks like it's going to impact the annual number by probably about 20 basis points for the total company. Just wondering if you could just sort of walk through each of the segments for us. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. Chuck, as we look out, to your point, in total, we are looking for improvement in our gross profit line for the year. Again, it is a little more back half oriented, where we see that improvement as we cycle the tariffs that we called out for Q1 and Q2. And to your point, the tariffs affect the Dollar Tree banner. Probably about 80% of the tariffs are related to Dollar Tree. There are some Family Dollar effect out of those tariffs as well. \n So I think if you look at that, I think the other point that we have going on in gross profit is distribution. And I think we've seen a little more pressure on the Dollar Tree side than the Family Dollar side. But in general, I think we'll see -- we're going to see improvement in both and -- as we go through the year. So I think that's kind of how we're thinking about SG&A. On the other side of the equation, the SG&A side, I think, is flat to slightly better. And again, obviously, top line helps dictate that as well as us controlling our costs. And obviously, the pressure point has been store labor with the average hourly rate increases. And again, we always have initiatives to help reduce that, and the team continues to do that. But that's the one point of pressure really on the SG&A side. \nCharles Grom: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Gary, just one for you. Just the thoughts the pivot on the multi-price points. Can you maybe just speak to the number of SKUs? You're going to be testing a number of stores in 2020, how it's going to roll out? And I guess, relative to the performance that you saw last year. \nGary Philbin: I'm going to hand it over to Mike, if you don't mind, just because he's been leading the charge on this one. \nCharles Grom: No problem. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Thanks for the question. We look forward to the new categories. There's going to be about 20 new categories across the store in 4-foot sections and the variety of categories that you said. We're excited about them. They'll start landing it, I would say, 2/3 of them in this month and then some in late April, early May and then cleaning up just a few in October. \n But we're excited about them. They're going to be more of the general merchandise and the excitement in the WOW. We've looked at the marketplace. We know it's out there. Those price points of $5 and below. And we're going to bring some nice products with some good margins for the company. \nCharles Grom: Okay. And just one more, if I could just sneak in, just the decision not to do more consumables. I guess the question was like, why did it not work? Or you feel like you can just show greater value on the discretionary? \nMichael Witynski: We believe we can show the second part of your thought is the better value. It's what Dollar Tree is known for is bringing that excitement in WOW. We know the manufacturers that can help us produce those products, and we think we can bring more value to the customer in those categories. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital. \nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli. Question. Did you guys pick up the extra $19 million that you called out as a tariff headwind in 4Q? Because I think there were some delays on those -- on that tariff implementation. And then related to that, does the threat of tariffs, which can obviously be implemented very quickly, potentially influence how you might be viewing the Dollar Tree Plus! test? \nKevin Wampler: Scot, as it relates to the Q4 tariffs, again, we did see those flow through as we guided to. And again, in the prepared remarks, I called out the fact that within the Dollar Tree banner itself, it was basically about 65 basis points of headwind. So those did flow through. And as you -- and really the change in tariffs that happened since we last spoke was the 4A going to -- from 15% to 7.5%, but that it actually didn't happen until February 14 after quarter end. So really, everything we talked about when we talked to you last at the end of Q3, it was in place, and we did see it flow through our P&L. \nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And then... \nGary Philbin: Scot just second piece. Dollar Tree Plus! 2.0, I think the way we're thinking about it, here's a chance to expand the circle for Dollar Tree. That's why we're doing it as much as anything to do that and expand margin because we think we have the opportunity here to really manufacture the type of items that we've done at $1 price point. \n So let's do some of the same things that create value, create that WOW effect. And that's why we're doing it. \n So listen, I'd like to think that we're in a stable environment here for tariffs. That gives our team a chance to go over and continue to mitigate on each buying trip and find value and add items and drop items. It's what we do. It's easier when we obviously know the rules that we're playing with, when we go over. So I think Dollar Tree Plus! is about expanding who comes into a Dollar Tree. That's our primary purchase and have them buy more. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: I guess, just another one on mix. As you think about your guidance for this year, what are you planning in terms of mix, particularly at Family Dollar? Obviously, a focus to improve that, but just curious what level of success you're baking in, in terms of that mix improvement? \nKevin Wampler: Yes, Kelly. I think as you think about it, our consumable mix were approximately 77% consumables at this point in time. So to move it, it takes a lot, as you might imagine. The plan would be to, obviously, have performed better in discretionary this year as we go through. Obviously, we're disappointed in Q4 in that arena. As we go through the year, we think we can positively affect that. It will have moved it a lot in the first year, maybe not a lot, but I think it builds the foundation to continue that improvement going forward is the way we would think about it. \nGary Philbin: Kelly, I would be disappointed if we don't get to the fourth quarter and have a much better season. Part of it will be we've got a better calendar for sure. Part of it will be some of the efforts we made in January on the buying trip. So I think by the time we get to the holiday season, at Family Dollar, my expectation is we ought to see improvement year-over-year. And that's what we're tasking ourselves with. \n So as we go through the year, we all pick up steam, but don't lose sight. The other piece of this on the consumables is we want to get after the great offers on the private brands, which our customer sees great value versus national brands. We -- that's the same kind of effort we need there as much as we need on discretionary consumables. Within consumables, we can drive private brands. \nKelly Bania: Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up. Can you just provide a general update on turnover? And how that's trending at both banners and the DCs? And just how you feel about the compensation structures across the organization? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, thanks for your question. This is Mike. Our turnover at our retail stores is actually trending to be that we just finished up the best year we've had in the last several years at both banners, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree at the store manager ranks. And at our DC, we do have turnover. And we -- as we look at the competitive environment and the average hourly rate by markets, we are adjusting accordingly to mitigate that as much as possible. \nOperator: Our final question will come from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nJudah Frommer: First, I just wanted to circle back on the tariffs and the $47 million impact in the first half of this year. I think we kind of felt like we were done once we got the $19 million disclosure for Q4. So what's changed? Is there more timing impact or have mitigation efforts? Are they not seeing the same results that they saw last year? And do you feel like the $47 million should be the end of it, if tariffs stay in place as they are today? \nKevin Wampler: As it relates to $47 million, to your last part of your statement, yes, we do believe that if tariffs stay as they currently are that the incremental piece we're seeing is the last major incremental piece. It's always going to change based on the mix of products we select and bring to the marketplace. \n I don't know -- from an overall standpoint, if the standpoint of $47 million additional this year, we have to remember a couple of things. One, at this point in time a year ago, Lists 1 through 3 were 10%. They're now at 25%. List 4A at 7.5% did not exist. So basically, that's what you're -- we're cycling against. And then in some instances, we've decided not to mitigate some of these just based upon the value perception of the product that we bring to the marketplace. So I think those are some of the things that play into that. But I -- to your point, this should be -- assuming that things -- the tariff rules stay as they are as we get through the first half, then it becomes more of an even playing field going forward. \nGary Philbin: And Judah, I would just, [ for up to ], we continue to work on supply chain. It's not the easiest thing to lift up a supply chain from China to move somewhere else, but we have done it. And we've moved it to other Southeast Asian countries. We moved some back domestically. We move some to Mexico. \n So that's part of what we do on every trip. So it is something that we have -- as long as we have visibility to it, we can make better choices on what we want to buy to. So stability will go a long way. But the $47 million is what we see because we still got inventory flowing through in Q1 at the higher 15% on 4A. The 7.5% didn't go into effect till Valentine. That's going to take a while to unwind. And then we'll have that product going through that wasn't in place last year. So I hope that gives you some color on it. \nJudah Frommer: Yes, that's really helpful. And then lastly, I was just hoping maybe you could help us with some color on top line trajectory kind of early in Q1. I think some other retailers that saw that squeezed during the shortened holiday period have given some color around kind of the bounce back in February. It seems like maybe that should be easier in Dollar Tree, given potentially promotions weighing down price in Family Dollar. \n And then, anything you could call out on coronavirus-related demand or stock up at either banner in the last week or 2? \nGary Philbin: Well, the -- I called out really I've always thought the efforts around our seasons are so important at Dollar Tree, which is why I called out Valentine's Day and a much better holiday this year, and we gotten out of the gates quickly and lots of love in the air. We sold over 10 million-plus balloons and cards. And so that all felt pretty darn good to us for Dollar Tree and been a good Valentine's at Family Dollar, which is a smaller department. But the bigger opportunity there was tax time, which I called out on some of the promotional activity. \n We certainly are seeing a spike on anything that's related to hand sanitizers and cleaning surfaces. But I would say we're also in 1st of month right now in tax refund time. So right now there is money in the market for all those reasons, plus a heightened efforts for everyone to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer. So we're seeing that in the stores as well. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Randy Guiler for closing remarks. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Britney, and thank you for joining us for today's call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss Q1 results is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, May 28, 2020. Thank you. Have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Wampler",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning. Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 1.8% to $6.32 billion, comprised of $3.52 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.8 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 0.4%. And on a segment basis, same-store sales for Dollar Tree increased 1.4% and for Dollar -- Family Dollar decreased 0.8%. Overall, our gross profit was $1.96 billion compared to $1.91 billion in the prior year's quarter. \n Gross margin was 31% of sales compared to 30.8% in Q4 of 2019. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of sales to 36.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter included merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 40 basis points, primarily due to the impact of List 4A tariffs, which represented approximately 65 basis points of headwind. This was partially offset by lower freight costs. Distribution costs increased approximately 25 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. Shrink increased approximately 15 basis points based on unfavorable inventory results and an increase to the accrual rate. And occupancy costs increased approximately 10 basis points based on loss of leverage from the lower comp sales. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 100 basis points to 24.6% during the fourth quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: markdown expense improved approximately 100 basis points as we cycled the $40 million reserve for Q4 of 2018. And merchandise costs, including freight, decreased approximately 60 basis points, driven primarily by improved initial mark-on and freight costs. These were partially offset by a higher percentage of lower-margin consumable sales. These benefits were partially offset by occupancy costs, which increased approximately 35 basis points due to higher real estate taxes and loss of leverage on lower comp sales. Distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increased payroll costs at the DCs, and shrink increased approximately 10 basis points. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses, including discrete charges, were 27.1% of net sales compared to 65.4% of net sales in the prior year's quarter. Excluding the discrete charges in 2019 and 2018, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 21.9% compared to 21.3% in the prior year's quarter. For the fourth quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment, when excluding its portion of the litigation reserve as a percentage of sales, increased to 20.1% compared to 19.7% for the fourth quarter of 2018. This increase was due to the following: payroll cost increased approximately 30 basis points, primarily due to an increase in store hourly payroll due to higher average hourly rates; and additional  output to support store initiatives. Operating cost increased by approximately 10 basis points, resulting from increased debit and credit card fees due to higher penetration and higher insurance costs, and depreciation increased approximately 10 basis points. \n The SG&A rate for Family Dollar segment, when excluding the goodwill impairment and the litigation reserve, increased 20 basis points to 21.5% compared to 21.3% for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to the loss of leverage on negative comp sales. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 15 basis points, and operating expenses increased approximately 10 basis points, resulting primarily due to higher debit and credit card fees and increased insurance costs comparable to Dollar Tree. \n Corporate and support expenses increased 15 basis points, primarily related to higher incentive comp and stock compensation expense compared to the prior year quarter based on timing of performance adjustments between Q3 and Q4 year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, excluding discrete charges for -- from 2019 and 2018, adjusted operating income was $580.4 million compared with $632.6 million in the same period last year, and adjusted operating margin was 9.2% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales in last year's fourth quarter. \n Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $39.9 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 5.1% in Q4 of 2018. These rates are affected by the noncash goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2019 and 2018 that are not tax deductible. Without the goodwill impairment charges included in net profit before tax, the tax rates for Q4 2019 and Q4 2018 were 16.6% and 21.2%. The decrease in Q4 of 2019 rate is a result of a reduction in tax expense of $24.6 million for the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the company's foreign net operating loss carryforwards. \n For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, the company had net income of $123 million or $0.52 per diluted share. This compared to a GAAP net loss of $2.3 billion or a loss of $9.69 per share in the prior year's quarter. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for Q4 2019 were $1.79. Please refer to the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in today's press release. \n Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at fiscal year-end totaled $539.2 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Outstanding debt as of February 1, 2020, was approximately $3.8 billion. The company paid $500 million in January 2020 on its $750 million floating rate note. The remaining $250 million is due April 2020. \n Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 8.4% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 1.2%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the first quarter. \n Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 7.7% from the same period last year and decreased 2.8% on a selling square foot basis. Based on store closures, the Family Dollar segment has 5.1% less square footage outstanding. \n Capital expenditures were $252.5 million in the fourth quarter versus $194.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, capital expenditures totaled $1.035 billion. For fiscal 2020, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures will be focused on 550 new stores and 1,250 Family Dollar H2 renovations. The addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to select existing Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores, IT system enhancements and projects, development of our Chesapeake campus, installation of LED lighting as well as HVAC and flooring replacements in select stores and the completion of construction of our new distribution center in Rosenberg, Texas as well as the start of construction on Dollar Tree regional DC17 and a high-velocity DC. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $179.1 million for the fourth quarter and $166.7 million in fourth quarter last year. For the year, depreciation expense totaled $645 million. \n For fiscal 2020, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $680 million to $690 million. Our initial outlook for fiscal 2020 includes the following assumptions: our outlook does not include any potential impact related to the supply chain or other aspects of the company's business for the COVID-19 coronavirus. For same-store sales, we are forecasting low single-digit positive comps for the year. \n Calendar considerations for 2020 include the following: Easter will be 1 week earlier, which will have an estimated $10 million negative impact on sales in the first quarter; and there will be 2 additional selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to 2019, which should positively impact Q4 sales by an estimated $12 million. \n On a GAAP basis, we expect to incur approximately  [ $48 ]  million less in onetime costs in 2020 compared to 2019. This relates to costs in 2019 associated with store closings, markdowns and accelerated rents as well as consolidating our store support centers. \n With regard to tariffs, our outlook includes an estimated $47 million of incremental costs in fiscal 2020, with nearly all of it to be incurred in the first half of the year. \n From a GAAP EPS standpoint, we believe our toughest year-over-year compare will be Q1, as we are incurring incremental tariff cost of approximately $25 million compared to Q1 of 2019. Additionally, we are planning on increased promotional activity for our Family Dollar banner as we rebuild our discretionary merchandise assortment. While our first quarter outlook includes the expected pressure from these tariffs and increased promotional activity, we believe we are well positioned to deliver improved sales, operating margin and earnings in the following 3 quarters and for full year 2020. \n We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets; states increasing minimum wages; unemployment levels, including the company's initiative plans, including H2 renovations, Snack Zones and Crafters Square projects. We continue to partially offset these average hourly rating increases through productivity initiatives in our stores. \n We estimate year-over-year domestic freight cost to be slightly lower in 2020. Import freight rates will be higher as we annualize our April 2019 rate increases. In addition, we expect the new clean fuel regulations for ocean vessels to contribute to higher import rates in 2020. We expect distribution costs to be a headwind during the year from wage pressures created from the tight labor market for both banners and depreciation cost pressure specific to the Dollar Tree segment. We do expect the distribution cost headwinds to dissipate as we go through the year as productivity initiatives positively affect the network. \n Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $38 million in Q1 and approximately $145 million for fiscal 2020. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We've not adjusted our outlook for currency rate changes. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23% for the first quarter and 22.8% for fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 238.1 million shares for Q1 and the full fiscal year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. The company has $800 million remaining under the Board repurchase authorization. \n For the first quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.89 billion to $5.99 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.09. These estimates are based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and year-over-year square footage growth of 1.5%. \n For fiscal 2020, we are forecasting total sales to range between $24.21 billion and $24.66 billion based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and approximately 3.1% selling square footage growth. The company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for fiscal 2020 will range between $4.80 and $5.15. \n And looking at our 2020 outlook, when compared to 2019 performance, the upper end of our 2020 guidance is $5.15. Adding back the impact of $47 million or $0.15 per share in incremental tariffs in 2020 and $28.6 million or $0.12 per share for the equalization of tax rates for both years, brings the adjusted EPS for 2020 at the high end to $5.42. When compared to the 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $4.76, 2020 adjusted earnings of $5.42 would be a 14% increase year-over-year. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Gary. Sure, Matt. This is Kevin. Thank you for the question. Again, I think, obviously, moving pieces in the last couple of years. And I think, obviously, most recently, tariffs this year, obviously, have been a headwind, which, obviously, will fully cycle as we go through the year. The team continues to work to mitigate and do everything we can to provide great value to our consumer through that process. I think the other thing, if you look at our mix, our mix at Dollar Tree continues to be good. \n I think, obviously, there's been some things outside of the actual product cost at the end of the day. So if you look at distribution costs, you look at shrink, some items that traditionally, we've been very good at controlling, and we can be very good in the future as we go forward as well. I think those are the items that we have to work on. I think the -- but overall, the consumable and discretionary business, we feel very good about where we're at. Yes, Matt. I think we do look for positive comps in each quarter of the year. We do look for the business to get stronger as we go. We will cycle some red tag sales from our stores that we were closing last year. So we have a little higher hurdle from that as we go. But I think that will be fine. So I think that's -- from that perspective, we would expect positive as we go through the year. Yes. I think when we think about it long term, Robby, is, obviously, we've got a lot of noise in the number the last couple of years with various charges and onetime discrete costs and so forth. But on a general basis, my viewpoint would always be, we're going to look to grow our bottom line faster than top line. And I think we're always looking to say, can -- we want to grow 10% plus on our EPS. It is always the way we're going to look at it. And I think, historically, we've been able to do that. I think we're going to get back to that as we go forward. And while we don't traditionally use an algorithm per se, that's just how I think about it from a metric standpoint. Yes. Chuck, as we look out, to your point, in total, we are looking for improvement in our gross profit line for the year. Again, it is a little more back half oriented, where we see that improvement as we cycle the tariffs that we called out for Q1 and Q2. And to your point, the tariffs affect the Dollar Tree banner. Probably about 80% of the tariffs are related to Dollar Tree. There are some Family Dollar effect out of those tariffs as well. \n So I think if you look at that, I think the other point that we have going on in gross profit is distribution. And I think we've seen a little more pressure on the Dollar Tree side than the Family Dollar side. But in general, I think we'll see -- we're going to see improvement in both and -- as we go through the year. So I think that's kind of how we're thinking about SG&A. On the other side of the equation, the SG&A side, I think, is flat to slightly better. And again, obviously, top line helps dictate that as well as us controlling our costs. And obviously, the pressure point has been store labor with the average hourly rate increases. And again, we always have initiatives to help reduce that, and the team continues to do that. But that's the one point of pressure really on the SG&A side. Scot, as it relates to the Q4 tariffs, again, we did see those flow through as we guided to. And again, in the prepared remarks, I called out the fact that within the Dollar Tree banner itself, it was basically about 65 basis points of headwind. So those did flow through. And as you -- and really the change in tariffs that happened since we last spoke was the 4A going to -- from 15% to 7.5%, but that it actually didn't happen until February 14 after quarter end. So really, everything we talked about when we talked to you last at the end of Q3, it was in place, and we did see it flow through our P&L. Yes, Kelly. I think as you think about it, our consumable mix were approximately 77% consumables at this point in time. So to move it, it takes a lot, as you might imagine. The plan would be to, obviously, have performed better in discretionary this year as we go through. Obviously, we're disappointed in Q4 in that arena. As we go through the year, we think we can positively affect that. It will have moved it a lot in the first year, maybe not a lot, but I think it builds the foundation to continue that improvement going forward is the way we would think about it. As it relates to $47 million, to your last part of your statement, yes, we do believe that if tariffs stay as they currently are that the incremental piece we're seeing is the last major incremental piece. It's always going to change based on the mix of products we select and bring to the marketplace. \n I don't know -- from an overall standpoint, if the standpoint of $47 million additional this year, we have to remember a couple of things. One, at this point in time a year ago, Lists 1 through 3 were 10%. They're now at 25%. List 4A at 7.5% did not exist. So basically, that's what you're -- we're cycling against. And then in some instances, we've decided not to mitigate some of these just based upon the value perception of the product that we bring to the marketplace. So I think those are some of the things that play into that. But I -- to your point, this should be -- assuming that things -- the tariff rules stay as they are as we get through the first half, then it becomes more of an even playing field going forward."

            "name": "Gary Philbin",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our team's accomplishments in fiscal 2019, including the successful consolidation of our store support centers, the material acceleration of the family Dollar store optimization program and the initial launch of our Dollar Tree Plus! initiative. For Q4, despite the compressed holiday shopping season, with 6 fewer days between Thanksgiving, Christmas, we delivered positive same-store sales for the enterprise, while managing margins and costs effectively to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.79, near the top end of our guidance range. \n Fiscal 2019 was an important year for our organization as we further developed the foundation and fundamentals to grow and improve our business. Our accomplishments for 2019 include the following: first, consolidation of our store support center brought the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams together in 1 building. This was a major project and announced in September of 2018 and completed this past July. \n Our working in one space has increased the energy; benefited our culture and driven collaboration, efficiency and teamwork that will enable us to provide even better support to our stores as we move through 2020. Our store support consolidation allowed us to organize our management around the key processes within the company and flattened our organization to accomplish the speed and focus we need to have on key initiatives this year. \n We've made significant progress on the Family Dollar store optimization program, including closing more than 400 stores; rebannering 200 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Trees; and renovating more than 1,100 mature stores at Family Dollar into the H2 format. Third, the Dollar Tree Plus! was introduced around midyear, Mike will provide an update on the initiative, including the details of our Dollar Tree Plus! 2.0 that is being implemented into our test stores this month. \n Fourth, we repurchased 200 million in shares during 2019. In recent years, we have made significant process of paying down debt. We have a scheduled debt payment for $250 million in April 2020, and we currently have an $800 million authorization remaining on our Board repurchase plan. \n Our merchant teams traveled overseas for their annual post-holiday buying trip in January. This trip was led by our enterprise chief merchant. The teams continue to work directly with a diverse group of qualified factories. In fact, we had vendors from 8 other Asian countries that tend our qualifying open buying day. We consider this to be one of our most successful buying trips. We were pleased with the continued support we are receiving from our extended vendor group, and we were able to buy the value in key items and departments for both banners for the 2020 holiday season. \n Importantly, all returned from China healthy and safe despite of the news regarding the outbreak of the coronavirus. \n Let me give you a bit of an update on the coronavirus as it affects our supply chain as we see it today. Our global sourcing group and merchants, along with our logistics team, are meeting daily and updating our progress on visibility to individual purchase orders. Generally, we are seeing production pickup, and factory attendance is increasing each week. Our global sourcing team in China and third parties that provide quality assurance inspections are nearly at normal levels. \n All ports and third-party freight consolidators are open and operating at near-normal levels, and we are getting all needed space on vessels for our freight. At this point, all of our Easter merchandise and lawn and garden seasonal product is in our domestic supply chain, either in distribution centers or flowing to stores. At this point, we see a very small percentage of product canceled and some product moving on to later delivery, usually by a few weeks. And our teams are working to mitigate with sources elsewhere, including domestic sources, to mitigate any effect there. More to come. \n In December, we announced enterprise-level organizational leadership changes to enhance the company's execution of our strategy and to improve performance across the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar business segments. Among the management changes were the promotions of Mike Witynski to Enterprise President; Rick McNeely to Enterprise Chief Merchandising Officer; and Tom O' Boyle to Enterprise Chief Operating Officer. \n These and other actions are designed to increase enterprise-wide focus, efficiencies and accountability. With Mike, Rick and Tom, we now have our senior leadership working together across the company with increased urgency to move the needle on initiatives that will help us deliver bottom line results that will drive value to our shareholders and customers. \n Since joining Dollar Tree in 2010, Mike Witynski has been a key executive and partner in driving performance across the organization. In particular, Mike has had the store excellence, operational initiatives and merchandising programs to drive sales and margin and has been hands-on in managing our tariff mitigation efforts the past 18 months. Mike's promotion to Enterprise President will continue our progression of elevating customer-facing initiatives in merchandising and store operations. \n I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Thanks, Kevin. Work from our teams in 2019 set the stage for us to be able to grow and improve our businesses in 2020. Our teams are able to achieve several important milestones through '19 and mitigate some of the challenges. The time, effort, resource and focus on bringing more than 500 jobs to Chesapeake, Virginia by consolidating our store support centers; the Family Dollar store optimization effort to close more than 400 stores and rebanner another 200; the doubling of H2 renovation projects from 518 to more than 1,119; all the tariff mitigation efforts regarding trade during the year; and the impact last year to our balloon and party business from the helium shortage. \n Here's the good news for 2020. Our management team is in one place, with our senior leadership, focusing on the priorities and initiatives to drive the business. Our management team is tapped to do the following: as always, drive our top line with exciting merchandising execution; improve on shrink; drive supply chain efficiencies, both in freight and distribution costs; improve the mix on the discretionary side of Family Dollar, creating more value; reinvent the WOW of Dollar Tree, as always, with our new drive the business opportunities that you heard Mike describe and Dollar Tree Plus! continue our tariff mitigation on each buying trip and the continued refinements to drive the H2 format this year and next. Our customers are responding to the store layout and assortment and price impact. Our teams are focused and energized and well prepared for 2020. \n As we start Q1, we have seen our customers at Dollar Tree respond to our first big seasonal holiday, Valentine's Day. Helium was in good supply, and certainly not the issue we had last year. We had a terrific holiday, with sales, traffic and positive comps in our party department. \n For Family Dollar, we have been focused on tax refund time to drive our business into departments that our customer spends on this time of the year. We have increased promotional activity during this important time. And we are at the peak of it right now and like the traffic we are seeing across those departments. All this progress will not be possible without the contributions of each and every one of our associates. For them, in more than 15,200 stores across the U.S. and Canada, our network of 24 distribution centers and our store support center in Chesapeake, Virginia, I'd like to just add my thanks to all of them for their ongoing commitment, dedication and efforts to serve our customers every day. Our efforts in 2020 are focused on the urgency around our key initiatives to drive bottom line results in supply chain, our continued progress on H2 store renovations, shrink, elevating training at field and store level for increased customer engagement. \n In summary, we are -- we continue to focus and make meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both brands. We are well positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increase value for our shareholders. The combination of more than 15,200 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers in all types of markets. Our teams are excited about seizing the opportunities in tackling the challenges ahead of us in 2020. \n Operator, we're now ready for questions. Matt, Gary. I would just say this. Long term, we've always been between 35% and 36%,  and that's what we're going to get back to and operate within those ranges. And I mean, you nailed it. The transitory issues have been tariff, distribution, freight, shrink. Those are all the things that I think the longer we are able to navigate around them, we'll be able to see them go away and some effort on each buying trip as if tariffs stay in place, we mitigate them. \n The mix, I'm pleased with. We've seen, despite the fact that we always drive traffic in that Snack Zone, our customers are really going to be excited about Crafter Square. And that's the other side of the margin equation that we've always done at Dollar Tree. So it's always a 1, 2 step with us. And I think we get back to the 35%, 36% for Dollar Tree. The other piece, Matt, is we'll be building up on H2s as we go through the year as well. And regarding the promotional activity, I would just tell you, we knew there was a shortened holiday season for the Christmas season. And we just went into this year knowing that while we're going to be cycling some of the red tag event, we also really got to get after the discretionary side of our business at Family Dollar. And tax time last year, I think we just had an opportunity to build on. It's when our customer has money in her pocket. It's what she's shopping the store for things that she does always have money for. And it shows up in bedroom, bathroom, kitchen items that are basically the capital expenses for her for the beginning of the year. So we want to go into this season with really loaded with the right items, what we think is the appropriate promotional activity in Q1 during this important tax time. Robby, this is Gary. Listen, I don't think it's either/or. I mean the same way that at Dollar Tree, we've always gone after what you do to drive the business. That tends to be on the consumable side of the store. And then what do you have to do that is on the customer maybe want list instead of needs list. So what Rick brings to it is that process. And our strategy is very clear. We're speaking with one voice, not just to our people, but also to the trade, which goes a long way. And a lot of the discretionary business is things that we can import, the things that we can drive the business on because we invent the product. \n Yes, our customers need basics, but when you get to the seasons, when you get to cook out time, when you get to celebrations, we're introducing Hallmark cards into Family Dollar this year. You heard us talk an awful lot about that over the last 18 months at Dollar Tree in the same kind of card assortment, slightly different, will be into Family Dollar stores as well. And even if it's in consumables, I think it's important to just point out maybe what's different at Family Dollar is our private brand business. \n And while it's,  \"a consumable,\" it's a higher-margin category across all of our own private brands. So that's something that we drive as well. Our immediate consumption is also a consumable, a snack, a drink. Those also are above-average margin. So those are the things that Rick is going to bring to the party. \n And then like all good retailers, we have competitors out there. And what we like about H2 is the lift we've been getting with the format has typically been in places where we don't see because we have that kind of competition out there. So that's why we're happy with the H2 lift as we go into 2020. Simeon, well, I think you've teed it up. The priority for us is to go after the discretionary business at Family Dollar. We've been happy with the consumables because it's been driving the traffic. But like I said before, you got to do both. So what's not working? We can spend a lot of time on that. But I think it's more about our process. It's about the value we bring to our customers as being in stock on the right items and the right store. It's inventing what's new. \n I think sometimes we fall into the trap. This is a customer that counts on Family Dollar for basics, without a doubt. You've got to be right on that. You've got to be ready on 1st of month. You've heard me say we got 13 holidays at Family Dollar, 12 1st of the month and the extra ones, the tax refund time. But that also means we got foot traffic in the store and the ability for us to find the right items in apparel, on seasonal, on electronics, on toys, those are the type of things that need value, the marketing behind it, the price-value equation, promotional activity. And really, those are the things that I think between Mike and Rick and the team at Family Dollar are very focused on right now to build this up. And I don't know another way of doing it, Simeon, other than going 4 feet by 4 feet across a store or when we're over in Asia, going through our items. We go through a SKU at a time and say what are we buying? What's the value equation? What's in the marketplace? And that's always been our process. So it's about that as much as it's about the item. Well, on a seasonal basis, we get a grade at the end of every season. So that part is sort of easy. Now as many guys sort of go back and reboot for the next year on what I would consider some of the basics on imports. So we -- but we can accomplish if you've been into an H2 on the impulse tables on our queuing line on some of the basics there every day. \n There, we have a chance either to do resets in some of the categories, which might need a major reset or to put in some impulse items that we can tap. So  you'll be iterative as we go through the year, both on -- both of those parallel paths, what are we doing across the categories and what are we doing from an in-and-out basis on some of the impulse categories --  it's not -- now unlike what we do at Dollar Tree, but different from the standpoint that there will be items, some at $1, but we have an opportunity to sell to customer here the things that she -- maybe at the end, that was on our list that's something cool at $5. Well, for the H2 on those -- the lift that we're getting, which we've called down around 10%, it's basically going up with the same way the fleet is. So which I think is a pretty good effort because keep in mind, what we've added in are additional frozen food doors, which fits a consumable line and expands that offering. We've also putting a queuing line that is a bit more of a mix of both discretionary. But the fact that we've sort of -- if you go back to last year, we were talking about a slightly negative impact from the discretionary. \n As we've gone through the year, we basically have gotten it to the fleet average. The issue is we need to improve the fleet average. And so part of that is what we're going to do across the entire chain, not just H2. But H2 is built to expand margins. We have put in the WOW tables. We have the opportunity with a queuing line. We have private label primarily displayed in the H2s in a bigger way. We got immediate consumption out there, like I said before, is at a higher margin. So those are the things that, over time, I'm counting on H2 to continue to drive the expansion as we go through our continued refinements of H2. \n And the second question, John? Well, we've always taken a look at what's it take to stay within the fleet in terms of top line sales, cash contribution. I think last year, what we were able to accomplish with the 400 closings was just get the stores that weren't going to get a lift because, in some cases, too small or the town had shifted, all the various reasons that we called out at the time. Yes, I think we take a look at the end of -- basically a lease term, and we take a look at the future of the store. \n Our guidance calls out something -- I would say, history says, between 75 and 90. I think we've put in over 100 this year on closings, and I think that reflects the continued really taking a look at all the stores and what it takes to stay within our store base as we continue to do and get better lifts on our remodels. Our fleet will change. We will have more and more stores be 5 years less -- 5 years or less, since they've been touched last through the new stores, H2 renovations, what we've closed, what we've rebannered. So our customer at Family Dollar is going to see a different fleet of stores. I'm going to hand it over to Mike, if you don't mind, just because he's been leading the charge on this one. Scot just second piece. Dollar Tree Plus! 2.0, I think the way we're thinking about it, here's a chance to expand the circle for Dollar Tree. That's why we're doing it as much as anything to do that and expand margin because we think we have the opportunity here to really manufacture the type of items that we've done at $1 price point. \n So let's do some of the same things that create value, create that WOW effect. And that's why we're doing it. \n So listen, I'd like to think that we're in a stable environment here for tariffs. That gives our team a chance to go over and continue to mitigate on each buying trip and find value and add items and drop items. It's what we do. It's easier when we obviously know the rules that we're playing with, when we go over. So I think Dollar Tree Plus! is about expanding who comes into a Dollar Tree. That's our primary purchase and have them buy more. Kelly, I would be disappointed if we don't get to the fourth quarter and have a much better season. Part of it will be we've got a better calendar for sure. Part of it will be some of the efforts we made in January on the buying trip. So I think by the time we get to the holiday season, at Family Dollar, my expectation is we ought to see improvement year-over-year. And that's what we're tasking ourselves with. \n So as we go through the year, we all pick up steam, but don't lose sight. The other piece of this on the consumables is we want to get after the great offers on the private brands, which our customer sees great value versus national brands. We -- that's the same kind of effort we need there as much as we need on discretionary consumables. Within consumables, we can drive private brands. And Judah, I would just, [ for up to ], we continue to work on supply chain. It's not the easiest thing to lift up a supply chain from China to move somewhere else, but we have done it. And we've moved it to other Southeast Asian countries. We moved some back domestically. We move some to Mexico. \n So that's part of what we do on every trip. So it is something that we have -- as long as we have visibility to it, we can make better choices on what we want to buy to. So stability will go a long way. But the $47 million is what we see because we still got inventory flowing through in Q1 at the higher 15% on 4A. The 7.5% didn't go into effect till Valentine. That's going to take a while to unwind. And then we'll have that product going through that wasn't in place last year. So I hope that gives you some color on it. Well, the -- I called out really I've always thought the efforts around our seasons are so important at Dollar Tree, which is why I called out Valentine's Day and a much better holiday this year, and we gotten out of the gates quickly and lots of love in the air. We sold over 10 million-plus balloons and cards. And so that all felt pretty darn good to us for Dollar Tree and been a good Valentine's at Family Dollar, which is a smaller department. But the bigger opportunity there was tax time, which I called out on some of the promotional activity. \n We certainly are seeing a spike on anything that's related to hand sanitizers and cleaning surfaces. But I would say we're also in 1st of month right now in tax refund time. So right now there is money in the market for all those reasons, plus a heightened efforts for everyone to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer. So we're seeing that in the stores as well."

            "name": "Michael Witynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, enterprise same-store sales grew by 1.8% to -- enterprise sales grew by 1.8% to $6.32 billion. Our consolidated same-store sales increased 0.4%. Both of our segments, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, were negatively impacted by the shortened holiday shopping season. We were also cycling an early release of February SNAP benefits into January a year ago. \n We delivered adjusted EPS of $1.79 for the quarter. Regarding the Dollar Tree segment, sales highlights for the fourth quarter include a 1.4% same-store sales growth, which represented Dollar Tree's 48th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Dollar Tree had increases in both traffic and ticket, with average ticket being slightly outpacing the traffic increase. Geographically, our strongest-performing zones were in the upper Midwest and the Northeast. \n Regarding the cadence of comps to the quarter, December and January were our strongest months. Dollar Tree had positive comps in both consumables and discretionary. We are pleased with the performance of our seasonal business and closeouts for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. Arts and crafts, pet supplies and snacks and beverage were also strong during the quarter. During the quarter, we added Snack Zone to 49 stores, bringing our fiscal 2019 total to 1,002 stores. This surpassed our goal of 1,000 stores for the year. We now have Snack Zones in 2,136 Dollar Tree stores. \n We continue to be pleased with the introduction of our Crafters Square initiative as well. Crafters Square is now in more than 650 Dollar Tree stores and consists of new expanded assortment of arts and craft supplies, all priced at $1. We plan to expand this program to many more Dollar Tree stores later this spring. \n The values are tremendous, and our customers are responding. Using the store locator function at dollartree.com, you can quickly locate the nearest Dollar Tree location with the Crafters Square selection. Please drop by and check it out. \n Now looking at Dollar Tree Plus! We are taking learnings from the first phase and moving into our next phase of development, which we refer to as Dollar Tree Plus! 2.0. Among the elements from our learnings that will be arriving in the test stores later this month include a shift away from consumable items into more discretionary margin-enhancing product mix. Categories will include electronics, toys, health and beauty, craft, seasonal and more. \n We are also updating and improving the in-store design elements to create a more excitement around the program and help deliver -- to help further delineate the $1 product from the multi-priced items. We continue to focus on finding value with our customers will recognize and our assortment will reflect retails at $5 and below. We feel this program will better represent what customers have come to expect from Dollar Tree, extreme value on an array of exciting items. More to come as we continue to learn, evolve and develop our Dollar Tree Plus!\n Regarding Family Dollar segment, sales highlights for the fourth quarter include: up against Family Dollar's toughest quarterly compare from the prior year and a compressed holiday selling season, same-store sales were down 0.8% for the quarter; comps were relatively balanced geographically, with the Western zone delivering a positive comp. \n Regarding cadence of comps to the quarter, both November and December were slightly negative. January, which was cycling the early release of SNAP benefits from a prior year, was our lowest comp month. The consumable side of the business delivered 13 -- delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Importantly, all geographic zones have positive comps and consumable. The performance of discretionary side of our business did not meet our expectations for the quarter, and the performance was relatively the same geographically. Shortly, I will share details on how we are addressing the discretionary business at Family Dollar. \n Now regarding H2. Our customers continue to be excited about the H2 renovations at Family Dollar. In the fourth quarter, H2 stores in their first year are comping at greater than 10% on average. These stores are driving greater loyalty, earning repeat visits and increasing value perception. We are committed to this store format and plan to renovate at least 1,250 Family Dollar stores to the H2 format in fiscal 2020. We began rolling out H2 format in Q3 of 2018. We are pleased that 2/3 of the comp lift is being driven by traffic and especially by the fact that H2s are working in both urban and rural locations. \n As a reminder, in our H2 stores, our efforts to drive performance are focused on creating price impact; highlighting our Family Dollar private brands; offering expanded and frozen food for convenient fill-in trips; expanding immediate consumption for snacks on the run; adding new impulse areas to drive value and margin; and introducing $1 impact section with ever-changing assortments of value, newness and excitement. The customer feedback we are receiving gives us credit across these areas of the store. We continue to refine the discretionary assortments to drive more business in these areas of the store. \n Now regarding the real estate for the enterprise during the quarter. We completed more than 230 projects, including 112 new stores, 17 relocations; 10 rebanners from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree, meeting our goal of 200 for the year; 5 Family Dollar renovations to the H2 format; and 95 closing stores, primarily at the end of the lease term. We ended fiscal 2019 with 15,288 stores. \n Now let me share a few thoughts of our Family Dollar business. I believe our biggest challenge in turning around Family Dollar has been on the discretionary side. Our consumable business is growing well and is driving traffic, improving the performance in the discretionary side of our business, is a key objective of Rick McNeely and his team in 2020. Rick has been a proven leader at Dollar Tree business for more than 15 years. \n I've seen Rick develop and drive key initiatives in seasonal, stationery, party, Snack Zone and most recently in our Craft business over the years at Dollar Tree. I'm confident that Rick and his leadership team will take the same approach with driving our discretionary business at Family Dollar. Rick will bring an unwavering focus on our customer by bringing the right products with the right value at the right price points for her basic needs, price, value and convenience on basic products is critical to our success. \n On the most recent buying trip in January, I've already seen the discretionary import process come to life. Rick brought the same rigor and processes that Dollar Tree has developed over the years for our import business to Family Dollar. The process has started with the customer in mind and delivering on our expected business goals, then Rick and the team dive into the category, the subcategory and the product and price, line by line, item by item. Every item gets scrutinized for value, meeting our customer needs and delivering on our financial goals. \n Now we have 1 leader. We are in the same building on the same floor and going on the same import trips. Rick brings a consistent singular process and voice to both segments of our business. He has an experienced, proven leadership team in place. This allows for sharing insights, moving with speed and leveraging efficiencies with our combined value on specific items and/or shared vendors. Our merchant teams are engaged, energized and equipped to drive the discretionary business at Family Dollar going forward, and I look forward to the change. \n I will now turn to Kevin to provide more detail on the fourth quarter performance and our initial outlook for 2020. Yes. Thanks for the question. We look forward to the new categories. There's going to be about 20 new categories across the store in 4-foot sections and the variety of categories that you said. We're excited about them. They'll start landing it, I would say, 2/3 of them in this month and then some in late April, early May and then cleaning up just a few in October. \n But we're excited about them. They're going to be more of the general merchandise and the excitement in the WOW. We've looked at the marketplace. We know it's out there. Those price points of $5 and below. And we're going to bring some nice products with some good margins for the company. We believe we can show the second part of your thought is the better value. It's what Dollar Tree is known for is bringing that excitement in WOW. We know the manufacturers that can help us produce those products, and we think we can bring more value to the customer in those categories. Yes, thanks for your question. This is Mike. Our turnover at our retail stores is actually trending to be that we just finished up the best year we've had in the last several years at both banners, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree at the store manager ranks. And at our DC, we do have turnover. And we -- as we look at the competitive environment and the average hourly rate by markets, we are adjusting accordingly to mitigate that as much as possible."

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Guiler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the third fiscal quarter of 2019. Participating on today's call will be our President and CEO, Gary Philbin; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler.\n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, included in the most recent press release, most recent 8-K, 10-Q and annual report, which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so.\n At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to Gary Philbin, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer. \nGary Philbin: Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. The third quarter represent another period of solid sales performance for both brands, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Our store optimization efforts and sales driving initiatives are working. The teams have completed more than 1,150 Family Dollar H2 renovations, nearly 200 Dollar Tree rebanners and more than 1,000 Dollar Tree Snack Zones and launched our Dollar Tree Plus! test already this year. These efforts have driven top line sales and transaction counts at both banners.\n Fiscal 2019 has been a unique year as a result of several factors. We planned and accomplished the material acceleration of our Family Dollar store optimization initiatives and the consolidation of our 2 support centers to Chesapeake, Virginia. Additionally, the global helium shortage, which has an outsized impact on our party business, and the continued uncertainty regarding trade and the related tariffs have impacted our business. I'm proud of our team's efforts and the sales execution through this environment.\n We worked hard to maintain focus on our customers and our values in store. Our results for the third quarter included sales increase of 3.7% to $5.75 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increase of 2.5%, and our EPS of $1.08 was within our guidance range. Other highlights for the quarter included completing 247 Family Dollar H2 renovations, completing 512 Dollar Tree Snack Zones, bringing our total to 2,087 across the chain, and repurchasing $11.6 million (sic) [ 125,048 ] shares as part of our share buyback program.\n And in mid-October, we hosted our fourth annual nationwide hiring event focused on hiring more than 25,000 associates in communities all across the country. This event provides individuals with the opportunity to join the Dollar Tree or Family Dollar teams. These new associates can earn the opportunity to be promoted through the field organization. As a growth company, we're always looking for talent and [ better ] strength that can develop into future leaders in our stores. Our application flow was strong for the successful hiring event.\n Regarding Dollar Tree segment sales highlights for the third quarter, we delivered a 2.8% comp, representing the 12th consecutive quarter of comps exceeding 2%. Dollar Tree had increases in both traffic and ticket, with traffic slightly outpacing the ticket increase. Geographically, all zones comped positively and were at or better than 2%. Strongest performing zones were in the Northeast, the upper Midwest and Southwest. Our cadence of comps in the quarter, all 3 months, were better than 2%, with August being the strongest month. Dollar Tree continues to deliver solid positive comps in the consumables category. And our seasonal business continued to perform very well. In fact, Halloween was on par with a very good seasonal sell-through we've been experiencing over the past couple of years.\n Our variety business, which includes party at Dollar Tree, comped positive each month during the quarter, but was again impacted by the helium shortage. We estimate that our comp was negatively impacted from lost balloon sales by about 20 basis points. We expect this helium shortage headwind to continue, but to a lesser degree, for the remainder of 2019.\n The Dollar Tree merchant team continued to do a terrific job of delivering ever-changing and new product ideas that drive customer excitement and repeat visits. Dollar Tree WOW is the excitement that our customers have come to expect. Snack Zones have started, 27 we have rolled out to great success, and we continue to extend this initiative into more Dollar Tree stores. Last year, we added Hallmark cards to all stores across the chain. It has proven to be a great partnership, and customers certainly love the Hallmark brand, the offering and the value.\n And this year, we've been rolling out a new program called Crafters Square. Crafters Square is now in more than 600 Dollar Tree stores and is our new and expanded selection of arts and crafts supplies, all priced at $1. Feedback from stores and customers has been fantastic, and we'll continue to expand this traffic-driving initiative to more stores going forward. The sharing of projects within the crafting community on Pinterest, Instagram and other platforms has made this one of the quickest launches to our customers on a small base of only 600 stores.\n Let me give you an update on Dollar Tree Plus! As we've discussed previously, we are conducting a test of multi-price points at select Dollar Tree stores. The multi-price points -- multi-price assortment is an increment of $2, $3, $4 and $5, is being tested in 115 stores. We just reached the 6-month mark in the initial stores, as the majority of the test stores were added in June. And we're closely monitoring performance, including impacts to traffic, sales, margin and, of course, customer feedback. As always with tests, we follow an iterative process where we test, learn, modify and improve along the way.\n Our focus regarding multi-price point tests as we finish this year and move into 2020 will be on delivering great values to our shoppers within targeted categories, shifting more towards discretionary and unique products that we believe delivers the WOW factor to consumers and is additive to the basket and margin profile. Utilizing our broad vendor base to source these great value products, ensuring, as always, that we protect the Dollar Tree brand. Our brand is more than the items we sell for $1. The Dollar Tree brand represents a pricing value and that the customers get tremendous value for what they spend at Dollar Tree. Our efforts to drive this test should include extending our reach by adding great value, exciting merchandise and opportunities to expand margin. We are still early in this test and look forward to updating you as the test evolves.\n Family Dollar team delivered another quarter of positive comps with a 2.3% increase. Importantly, comparable transaction count for the quarter was positive, continuing the trend that began to emerge in midsummer. Team's performance demonstrates that efforts to prove the consistency of execution across the chain and efforts to drive H2 performance are working and are gaining traction.\n Our Family Dollar segment highlights for the third quarter. Our consumables business performed very well, delivering its 12th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our cadence of comps through the quarter, all 3 months, were better than 1.5%, with August being the strongest month. From a zone perspective, comps for 6 of our 7 zones were positive, with the strongest performance in the West, Southwest and Southeast zones. Our Family Dollar customer service scores for Q3 showed improvement from the prior year. Categories of store cleanliness, product assortment, speed of checkout were among the notable improvements.\n We continue to believe we are taking the right steps to transform our customer experience to increase the frequency of the business. These steps include improving customer satisfaction, developing brand and price reputation, focusing on opening price points, incorporating better organized and focused Dollar impact sections and serving more of what our customers need, including frozen foods. And as we expected, the average scores for H2 stores, where we have invested in our fleet, are higher across the board. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our H2 store format of Family Dollar. All new and remodeled stores are in this format, which is driving greater loyalty, repeat visits and value perception in these locations. These renovated stores continue on average to deliver a comp greater than 10% in their first year post renovation. We are committed to this format and plan to renovate at least 1,000 Family Dollar stores to the H2 format in fiscal 2020. We began rolling out the H2 format in Q3 last year. We continue to like the sales that we are seeing in the H2 stores, now cycling into their second year.\n Our efforts to drive performance across the store base continue to focus on initiatives around our private brands with compare and save, our smart coupons that offer our loyal customers the latest and best values. Hallmark cards will be coming to all Family Dollar stores in 2020. And of course, our store manager training and retention efforts, as always, to drive performance and consistency store by store.\n In our store support center, we are seeing the benefits of having our teams, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, together in one location. We anticipate being together will greatly enhance our culture, our ability to recruit great talent and improve the collaboration within our organization as we train and develop and provide even more and better support for our stores.\n Looking at real estate for both segments in the third quarter. We opened a total of 165 new stores, 114 Dollar Trees, 2 in Canada and 51 Family Dollars. We relocated or expanded 12 Dollar Tree and 3 Family Dollar stores. We renovated 247 Family Dollars as a part of our H2 renovation initiative, and we rebannered 39 Family Dollars to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 463 projects during the quarter. We also added freezers and coolers into 138 Dollar Tree stores, bringing our total to stores with freezers and coolers to just over 6,000. During the quarter, we closed 42 stores, 12 Dollar Trees and 30 Family Dollars, and we ended the quarter with 15,262 stores: 7,447 Dollar Trees, 7,815 Family Dollars.\n Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I'd like to provide a brief update on tariffs. Just prior to our last earnings announcement in August, the USTR announced that tariffs on List 1, 2 and 3 products will increase from 25% to 30% on October 1. Tariffs on List 4A products would increase from 10% to 15% on September 1, and tariffs on 4B products would increase also from 10% to 15% on December 15. As noted in our August earnings announcement, our outlook provided at that time did not include any impacts related to these changes. Our updated outlook includes approximately $19 million of cost of goods sold, with the expected impact from USTR tariffs for List 1, 2 and 3 as well as List 4A and 4B tariffs, if fully implemented, in Q4. Nearly all the expected impact is related to the introduction of List 4A tariffs.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin. \nKevin Wampler: Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Consolidated net sales for the third quarter increased 3.7% to $5.75 billion, comprised of $3.07 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.67 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.5%. On a segment basis, same-store sales for Dollar Tree increased 2.8% and for Family Dollar, increased 2.3%. Overall, gross profit was $1.7 billion compared to $1.67 billion in the prior year's quarter. Gross margin was 29.7% of sales compared to 30.2% in Q3 of 2018. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 60 basis points to 34.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter included merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 55 basis points, primarily due to higher freight costs. And distribution costs increased approximately 10 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation.\n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 24.5% during the third quarter compared with 25.3% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to the following: Merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 30 basis points, driven primarily by an increase in freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise, partially offset by improved initial mark on. Shrink increased approximately 15 basis points resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the quarter. Distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increased payroll costs at the DCs. Occupancy costs increased approximately 10 basis points due to an increase in real estate taxes; and markdown expense increased approximately 5 basis points, resulting from higher clearance activity in the quarter.\n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter increased 30 basis points to 23.5% from 23.2% in the same quarter last year. For the third quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales increased to 22.1% compared to 22% for the third quarter of 2018. The increase was due to store operating costs increased by approximately 15 basis points resulting from increased debit and credit card fee penetration and an increase in loss on disposal of fixed assets from an earlier lease termination in the quarter. Payroll costs decreased approximately 5 basis points, primarily due to lower retirement plan expenses and lower insurance benefit expenses compared to prior year quarter, partially offset by an increase in store hourly payroll due to higher average hourly rates and an additional hours to support store initiatives.\n SG&A expenses for the Family Dollar segment were 22.5% of sales in the third quarter compared to 22.2% of sales for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to the -- of the following. Operating expenses increased approximately 25 basis points, resulting primarily from higher costs related to the disposal of fixed assets in connection with our store optimization initiative. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 10 basis points as a result of the capital investment required to support the H2 initiative.\n Corporate and support expenses increased 10 basis points, primarily related to store support center consolidation costs and higher depreciation. This included approximately $4 million of expenses related to the Q3 2019 discrete costs associated with our store support center consolidation. For the quarter, the company incurred approximately $9 million in total discrete costs, which was consistent with our guidance. On a consolidated basis, operating income was $358.4 million compared with $387.8 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin of 6.2% of sales compared to 7% of sales in last year's third quarter.\n Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $41.5 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.3% compared to 17.1% in the prior year's third quarter. The prior year quarter benefited by $15.7 million based on the company's substantial completion of our analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the net deferred tax liability valuation. The current year tax rate reflects the benefit of statute expirations and the reconciliation of the tax provision to the tax returns.\n For the third quarter, the company had net income of $255.8 million or $1.08 per diluted share as compared to net income of $281.8 million or $1.18 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $433.7 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Our outstanding debt as of November 2 was approximately $4.3 billion. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 125,000 shares for $11.6 million. At quarter end, we had $800 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We'll provide updates on additional share repurchases, if any, following the quarter in which they may occur.\n Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 14.4% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.5%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 6.4%. Our inventory levels reflect the early receipt of imports to mitigate tariffs. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the remainder of the year. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 4.2% from the same period last year and increased 0.9% on a selling square foot basis. Based on store closures, the Family Dollar segment has 5.1% less square footage outstanding.\n Capital expenditures were $279.8 million in the third quarter versus $228.4 million in the third quarter of last year. And for fiscal 2019, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion, consistent with our initial outlook. Depreciation and amortization totaled $160 million for the third quarter and $150.5 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2019, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $635 million.\n We've updated our outlook for fiscal 2019 and have lowered our guidance for Q4 based on the following expected effects. With regard to tariffs and USTR announcement, we estimate that Section 301 tariffs will increase our cost of goods sold by approximately $19 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the fourth quarter if the tariffs are fully implemented. Almost all other costs are due to List 4A as its timing did not allow for significant mitigation. We expect additional pressure on merchandise margins based on lower-margin consumables growing faster than originally forecasted. We expect distribution costs to be higher than originally forecasted, primarily due to payroll cost pressures from higher turnover, which may affect productivity. Expenses related to repairs and maintenance, utilities and depreciation are now expected to have a higher run rate than originally forecast.\n Additional assumptions in our outlook are the calendar considerations for the remainder of the year, which is that there will be 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will negatively impact Q4 sales. We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wages, unemployment levels and completing the company's initiative plans, including H2 renovations and Snack Zones. We estimate year-over-year domestic freight cost as a percentage of sales to be slightly lower in the fourth quarter. Import freight rates, as we noted on last quarter's call, will increase based on our April rate negotiations and beginning in January 2020, as a result of low sulfur fuel requirements for ships. Net interest expense will be approximately $41.9 million in Q4. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our outlook for currency rate changes. As always, our outlook assumes no additional share repurchases.\n Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.3% for the fourth quarter and 21.4% for fiscal 2019. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.7 million shares for Q4 and 238.2 million shares for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $6.33 billion to $6.44 billion in diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.70 to $1.80. These estimates are based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and year-over-year square footage growth of 1.1%. For fiscal 2019, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $23.62 billion and $23.74 billion based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase of approximately 1.1% selling square footage growth. Company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for the full fiscal 2019 will range between $4.66 and $4.76, which includes a discrete cost of approximately $85 million or $0.28 per diluted share, approximately $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share of store closure-related costs and approximately $19 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to tariffs.\n I will now turn the call back over to Gary. \nGary Philbin: Thanks, Kevin. Like I mentioned at the beginning of the call, 2019 has been a year of distinct opportunities. We planned and executed the material acceleration of our Family Dollar store optimization initiatives, snack Zone resets at more than 1,000 Dollar Tree stores and the consolidation of our 2 banners to our store support center in Southeast Virginia. We accomplished this against the backdrop of the helium shortage, the uncertainty regarding trade and related tariffs, continued impact of freight costs and DC costs affected by the increasing starting wage rates. I'm proud of the sales results at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar that were accomplished in the quarter. This was done in the first 3 quarters of the year with more than 2,000 stores disrupted from our initiatives. We invested in our stores, our starting rates in specific markets and have our fleet of stores ready for the fourth quarter and the key holidays.\n As stated in today's press release, we also announced that we will do at least another 1,000 H2 renovations in 2020. Our confidence in this model grows as we have more across our fleet of stores and various types of settings, demographics and densities of population. We will announce our new RILA and other store level capital plans for 2020 at the end of Q4.\n The impact on our gross margin in specific areas is ours to control and do better. We are focused on making improvements across several categories as we finish the year and start 2020. These areas include improving our shrink results, enhancing efficiencies within our supply chain to better manage freight costs, driving sales on the discretionary side of our business to reduce mix headwinds to margin, and tariff mitigation efforts.\n For shrink, our plans are focused on enhancing allocations and right-size inventories to all of our stores, especially those with a high shrink history; continued focus on training throughout our field leadership, districts and store teams; adding loss prevention tools within our stores; and last week, we're pleased to bring on seasoned, experienced retail executive in a senior VP role to lead both our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar asset protection teams. The asset protection teams from both banners will report to him effective immediately, and our visibility to market issues, external and internal, will be enhanced with the combined teams in priority high shrink markets. Our opportunities across our supply chain and freight costs are focused on optimizing our less than truckload inbound costs, fitting our key freight lanes, continuing to reward our best carriers by [ building ] that deliver on cost and service and getting back to our historical backhaul levels.\n On the discretionary side, at Dollar Tree, we are working hard to overcome our helium shortage with more party-centered items to service our customers. For Family Dollar, we like what H2 has done for the top line and transactions, focusing specifically around the impact on driving more discretionary within our stores. This includes our WOW tables, our dollar impact sections and the queuing assortment at checkout. We still have more runway for all of these discretionary sales in these areas. We're building on important categories that are doing well, especially around mom with kids across a combination of all things needed for young kids, including infant apparel and baby needs. Enhancing our party footprint with the addition of Hallmark-branded cards and Family Dollar through the first half of 2020.\n For tariff mitigation, we are planning to continue efforts to mitigate ongoing and potential new levels of tariffs as we head into 2020. These efforts include the continued support of many vendors to lower costs, the redesign of product or packaging, efforts to shift mix between higher and lower cost products, awarding volume from multiple vendors to our most competitive suppliers, moving product out of China to affect lower landed cost of goods and our combined teams' purchasing power throughout all of Asia. And as always, finding new vendors domestically and in other countries to develop the new and exciting values that our customers have come to expect. We are in the planning stages for 2020, and we'll provide details related to 2020 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.\n I believe our store teams are well prepared for the holiday season. I would like to sincerely thank each of our associates as we head into the fourth quarter and holiday season. More than 15,000 stores across the U.S. and Canada, our network of 25 distribution centers and, of course, our store support center in Virginia. Thank all of them for their commitment, dedication and efforts to deliver value and convenience to our shoppers each and every day.\n Finally, we continue to focus and make meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both brands. We are well-positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increased value for our shareholders. The combination of more than 15,000 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers in all types of markets. The combination of 2 great brands provides great flexibility in managing our future growth.\n Operator, we're now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: Can you talk about the margin profile on the remodeled Family Dollar stores? And related to that, given the mix that you have in those remodeled stores, which is much more consumable based. Is there a reason to believe gross margins can improve on a go-forward basis? Or is that higher mix of consumables in these stores effectively reset the gross margin profile for Family Dollar? \nGary Philbin: Scot, this is Gary. We're pleased with H2 because when we went into this, we knew we were adding in more frozen food doors and some more food that obviously has an impact on margin. But we also went into it with the thought of let's offset that with some of what we do on immediate consumption, the queuing lines, the WOW tables. I just think some better adjacencies to run the store. Early on, we saw some degradation in margin. But as we sit here now, H2 is neutral to the fleet, but we didn't do this to be neutral. I really -- our goal here is to have margin expansion within H2. So we're on the right path. We've got traffic going in these stores. And obviously, you've heard us call out that comp. Our next workflow is maintain all that and add margin expansion to H2. We like everything that the customers are telling us about it. We like the results on the top line and sales, and we got to get going on the margin mix now. \nScot Ciccarelli: And what kind of -- on a go-forward basis, Gary, that's helpful. But what kind of margin improvement do you think is realistic if we're looking out over the next, I don't know, 4 to 8 quarters? Because, I mean, we've seen several hundred basis points of gross margin degradation in that business, and I guess I just kind of keep coming back to the question, do we have a true reset here? Or is that something once we establish the better top line, we can kind of dig our way out? \nGary Philbin: Well, I've always said we need to get to an inflection point on the fleet. We were rebuilding the stores, basically one store at a time with H2. We did over 1,000 in the first 3 quarters this year. We're planning on doing 1,000 next year. I need the top line sales. I think that's what H2 has given us. The work on the margin, Q3 for Family Dollar, I think it was about an 80 points difference year-over-year comparison. The expansion that can rise across the whole fleet are some of the things I talked about. We got to focus on the discretionary seasonal apparel, electronics. All those are the categories that I think get teed up in the right way in H2. It doesn't mean that the rest of the fleet can't benefit from some of the same elements and efforts across the fleet. So we're putting together our '20 plan with specific initiatives around those discretionary categories to drive the -- maybe get the same benefit that we've really seen on the consumables side. We've got more folks coming through the front door here. And that is as important as anything that we do and now I got to get them over to the other side of the store to buy more of the discretionary product. That's doable. More to come when we announced our 2020 plan. \nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So at what point do you think you'll have a reasonable level of visibility into the business? The factors that you mentioned outside of tariff that contributed to your 10% to 15% decline, the reduction in your 4Q guidance, including mix, payroll pressures at the DCs and increased run rate for repairs and maintenance, utilities and depreciation should have been somewhat known and not really surprising. So is it -- once you get past this, then as we get into the first part of next year, you feel confident you have a level of visibility into the profitability of this business? Or is it going to take longer than that? \nKevin Wampler: Michael, it's Kevin. I think as we look at it, the items we called out, obviously, the shift in mix as we've seen the -- basically, the consumable business outpaced even what we had forecasted. And really, that's in both brands, more so in the Family Dollar brand and the Dollar Tree brand, but it's in both brands. So the Dollar Tree brand, we've got some good things going with frozen food, refrigerated and in center aisle as well. So a lot of things going on there. And again, a little bit of overall effect from the helium shortage and the halo effect to the party department in general.\n On the Family Dollar side, obviously we haven't seen the discretionary business kick in, as well as we'd like it to, Gary, what he was just speaking to. A lot of opportunity there, getting customers in the door is key, obviously, and getting the foot traffic and having that opportunity to sell them that discretionary item is very, very important. I think as we obviously look at other pieces of the business, obviously, we called out DC costs. Really, this is not an area we've called out in the past so much. It's really been more of a -- more -- a bigger topic as of late as we've gone into the, what we would call our seasonal peak here in the end of Q3 and beginning of Q4 as we look at basically getting all the merchandise through these buildings. And with unemployment where it's at, it's obviously required us to bring up basically starting wages and making sure we can engage with those associates and train them appropriately. \nGary Philbin: Michael, Gary. I would just add this. Keep in mind, this was a year that was everything we talked about at the beginning of the year. The store initiatives, 2,000 stores at various times torn up. Keep in mind, at the DC level, we were also not just shifting rebanners back and forth, we are also shifting product back and forth, especially with the impact of our Dollar sections in some of our WOW items. So along the way, we combined a store support center, too. With all those balls in the air, I give credit to our store teams and our store support teams to get that done. Everything we're talking about here gives us the consistency, visibility as we go forward in '20. We have done all this, really, with major initiatives, both in our store base, in our store support center. So listen, the things that we're focused on are the right things to drive the business. And with all that going on, we drove sales throughout the year. And with H2 stores, building momentum throughout the year, I'm really pleased with where we will end up on the top line and the initiatives around the margin piece, we got to get after on each of them. \nMichael Lasser: Totally reasonable, Gary. It just seems like investors want some time frame on when they can hold you accountable to an improvement in profitability and better visibility because there have been a lot of disappointment over the last few years and having some sense of when that might turn would be helpful to the investment community. And as part of that, are you still committed to the 14% to 18% EPS growth off your original GAAP guidance that you provided earlier -- in the year for 2020? And why would that no longer be the case? \nKevin Wampler: Michael, as we said before, that was at a point in time with what we knew at that point in time. Obviously, we're working through and finishing up our 2020 plans. Obviously, the biggest unknown as we sit here today for us and many other retailers is tariffs and where does that land at the end of the day. So obviously, we're committed to improving our business and improving on the many things we've talked about already this morning, but whether -- we'll give, obviously, guidance when we get to our fourth quarter call. And hopefully, we'll have some clarity around all those things. \nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: I know you give guidance on a consolidated basis. But to the extent possible, could you give maybe a little bit more detail regarding your expectations per banner, as we think about comps and gross margin and SG&A into fourth quarter? And then as a follow-up, just bigger picture for Dollar Tree. Margins look like they're going to be down this year. And just curious if you can walk through what some of those -- what you view as more temporary in nature as we kind of turn the page into 2020? Is this a business that you believe can get back to expanding margins? \nKevin Wampler: Paul, this is Kevin. I think as we look at it, again, we don't give guidance by banner. Obviously, when you look at it from a -- what I can give you a little feel for, for Q4, is, if you look at the guidance we gave today and you can back into a range of operating income based on all the data we've given you. And I would tell you that it's basically a little -- right around 9% or just above. If you compare that to prior year, excluding the items such as the markdowns for aged goods, clearance of inventory and in-store impairment, I would tell you that the pressure between basically gross profit and SG&A is fairly consistent. So we're seeing pressure on both line items. So that just gives you some directional ability to think about that.\n I think as we look at this year and as we look at obviously the fourth quarter, fourth quarter is a big quarter for Dollar Tree from a seasonal perspective. So we get a pretty good boost in sales just from a seasonal set, which obviously has always provided us the ability to basically provide a good gross margin. And I don't see that in there. But our seasonal set this year performed very well. We had a very good Halloween set. We had a very good performance with our Halloween seasonal, and we feel good about going into the fourth quarter with our Christmas set. So I think that always bodes well. Obviously, we do have the 6 less selling days, but that doesn't mean we're not going to try to make sure we do everything we can to get every last sales dollar that we can at the end of the day. \nGary Philbin: Paul, this is Gary. Let me sort of answer your question. What's temporary and start with Dollar Tree. The things that have we've been chasing this year start with shrink. It's a both banner issue. But shrink is something I have an expectation that we're going to do better on next year. We're coming off of a second year of not great performance, and we can do better. I think the freight piece, we started talking about it last year was certainly a bigger impact in the first half. We're going to see some of that modify in the second half, but we're still significantly up year-over-year.\n And the distribution costs, I think, listen, I don't know if it's temporary or not. I know that it impacts us when we have more folks coming into a DC. And it's really not even what you had to pay for us again the DC. It's almost the productivity that you lose in the DC because you've got new folks that you got to train and retain. Those are the things that I think were the one-offs for both banners that I would expect us to make improvement on in the initiatives we talk about.\n The mix on product, to me, is a bigger issue at Family Dollar than it is at Dollar Tree. We are happy with what H2 has done. But across 2019, we've worked hard on keeping sales going. And we just got to find some of the same elements that drive customer traffic into those sections as they do on the consumables. For Dollar Tree, I don't know how to think about tariffs. But it's always just going to be about incorporating the next WOW into the stores. We'd like what Snack zone has done for a little pressure on mix. That's why we got Crafters Square going. A year before that, we started out in Snack Zone, but we put in the Hallmark. So it's always what we push and pull to drive customers on both foot traffic and sales and margin. We're going to do that again as we go into '20. So those are going to be the pieces that we talk about category by category. Hope that's helpful. \nOperator: We'll go next to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. \nPeter Keith: So I want to look at the tariff impact. Certainly, it's a very volatile situation with a lot of unknown changes. It sounds like, though, the impact to Q4 is really just because of the timing with 4A implemented, you didn't have time to adjust. Are you still confident as you look at the 2020 that you think will be able to mitigate most of the List 3 and List 4 tariff pressures? \nGary Philbin: Peter, this is Gary. Yes. List 1, 2 and 3, I think the teams have been through a couple of cycles now of working with our vendors to either at lower cost or redesign packaging, so we can land it. And in some cases, we're moving outside of China, as you've heard us talk about. And even on this last trip, as we are buying already fall and Halloween next year, we've moved additional product out of China. So you're not going to be able to pick up that entire supply chain. But that's where we do sometimes, item by item, vendor by vendor, as we see those opportunities.\n As we go into 4A and 4B, it's more of our product. And as always, I want to go into 2020, I think, with some compelling product, and we're going to do the smart things around what we have to do to do the best we can to mitigate. I've also told our merchant teams, at the end of the day, I want to be able to see what it is. We might be changing or the opportunity to move price away from a vendor to another country before we do it.\n So 4A, what we've seen is when it gets announced and we don't have much time to mitigate, that's what we're calling out with the Q4 impact. Going forward, when we get a chance to get on our regular cycle buy and meet with our vendors, yes, we can mitigate more of it. I just don't have a full vision of that until we go on a big buying trip in January, which will be our first time really to meet with all of our vendors. And I'm assuming at that point, 4B is in effect as well. \nPeter Keith: Okay. And then just on the discussion of mix, particularly with the H2 remodels, one thing I'm trying to get my head around is, it would seem that with the increase of $1 items that you would be experiencing greater buying scale with similar items from Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. So it does seem to me that, at least from the outside, that there would be some benefits to mix from $1 item. So are we misreading that? Or is it just that the discretionary weakness is overarching negative on the business. \nGary Philbin: No. Well, you heard me talk a little bit about an H2 4-wall margin is about neutral to the fleet, and so that the overall mix change that we're experiencing is no different at H2. What's different is that we invested heavily with more of our lower-margin frozen food and additional expansion of some key categories in center of the store food as well. That's lower margin. That's been offset, you're exactly right, with the impact of the dollar sections, with the queuing assortment, with Dollar WOW tables, with immediate consumption.\n So the fact that we're back to fleet neutral margin, I think, shows the power of some of those sections we just got hampered up another level to get margin accretion going in H2 stores. So the way I look at with the team, we almost take a look at, here's the sections we've invested in, what's our sales and margin on a frozen food category and is that being offset with some of those other sections. And that's pretty much what we're seeing right now. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joseph Feldman with Telsey. \nJoseph Feldman: I just wanted to get a little more understanding of like the higher price point cash. And how are people responding to that so far? \nGary Philbin: I would say, as folks come in, I would say it's 1/3 folks have seen the product and buy it, 1/3 of our loyal customers have commented that they don't like the multi price go in our stores and 1/3 are somewhere in the middle. Here's my view from everything we've interviewed our customers with. It's not -- so far, we've had a priority on more consumables, which I think were an item that we want to just get out there across categories.\n The next phase of the test is more about what I would call the Dollar Tree WOW side of it. We went over on our buying trip this July to buy specific categories. So I would call them more on our variety, discretionary side, things that people haven't seen. And we'll see how customers respond. But I think that's more to what our customers are going to enjoy seeing incredible values on and allow us into our Dollar Tree WOW umbrella to say, \"that's a great item I don't see anywhere else. And I know that costs more when I do see it.\" And I think that's going to be what we push on into some of this showing up in stores now, but into 2020.\n So when we get a chance to test and learn and put new products in, especially when we can design them and import them or find discretionary items domestically, I just think that's going to be the next phase of the test that gives us another important data point. Our customers that buy it tend to buy more than the average Dollar Tree transaction, but I go back to what success, and success in this is really to increase the reach of Dollar Tree to another segment of customers, another chance to increase margin as well, and as always, protect the brand to say this is the WOW factor at Dollar Tree. So those are the things that are in the mix. I think we have some exciting product coming in, and we stay close to watching that week by week. \nJoseph Feldman: And then one follow-up. I know you outlined a couple of efforts on the freight side that you can do like optimize LTL and back to historical backhaul levels. Like how challenging a project is that to improve the freight side? Like, is that something that we can see happen pretty quickly into next year? \nGary Philbin: Well, we are seeing some modest year-over-year declines right now with it. And the things that we're doing, we're in control. But we need to bid out the process. Now somebody has to sign up for the lower bid and give us great service, both on inbound and outbound, to get those rates. So I'd like to think that it's something that as we read some of the same headlines, we are not in the same position as the truck driver shortage exactly at this time a year ago. I think that bodes well for us. The opportunity when we get better service on the outbound, allows us to do more backhauls. So we're going to go into 2020, pushing all the levers we know to do to get both lower freight and better service, and we'll understand better once our important third-party suppliers and independent truckers continue to give us service as we expect to as we finish out Q4 into 2020. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we have time for just a couple more questions. We'll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: Gary, curious when you think about the real estate composition of the 1,000 remodels you're going to do with Family Dollar this year -- this coming year, how will that be different than this past year? Is there a desire to maybe cluster more? And if you do cluster more, can that lift be brand perception at non-remodeled stores, if you do that? \nGary Philbin: Well, we do take a look where is the number of stores. We went into this knowing that we want to fix some of the oldest stores in the fleet. So based on the last year talks, we went into with the best opportunity based on volume. We did need a certain size. And really, what we're skating to is, by the time we face these next 1,000, we ought to be close to 40% of our fleet or a little better, being less than 5 years old. And I think to your point, that does give our customer give a perception of what they've seen at Family Dollar. So it's not necessarily that everything has to be H2. We've got some great stores out there that are not, but we are changing the face of what the customer sees with this store initiative, along with what we closed, along with what we rebannered to Dollar Tree. So the combination of all those things gets us closer to an inflection point, which is I think what you're talking about, what does that customer see. And inside the store, the consistency around store standards, conditions and stocks are important across all the factors of the different stores that we run. So that's what we're aiming for. And as we get more and more stores with the same opportunity, we're still measuring it what's our biggest return on capital as we go and invest in these stores. But I think just by the nature of our fleet with where we are across the country, we're starting to get some critical mass into some key geographies. \nJohn Heinbockel: And then lastly, when you look at the private brand penetration opportunity, recognizing it's all consumable at FDO. But is that another 500 basis point penetration opportunities or much bigger than that? Where do you think that shakes out? \nGary Philbin: Well, we've already said, we're in the low 20s as a brand, which is pretty darn good. I mean, it's not grocery store-esque because we're not a grocery store. But I think across the categories, what I would like to see is something closer to 100 basis point improvement consecutively over a number of years. I think that's the opportunity in front of us. And I think it speaks to, one, having great product and values in store. And number two, our customer just needs it because she's stretching her budget and the commitment on what we compare and save to national brands, I think, fits in our wheelhouse. I think the magic to it, as always, is introducing customers because they'll step up to private brands on something that first is something that they try on because it's a detergent, and then they'll go to HPA products, and then we'll go to food products. And the team has done a wonderful job on rebranding across the different categories. And I think that's opportunity still with runway to it. \nOperator: We'll go next to Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Just one clarification question on tariffs and a bigger picture question. In terms of the $19 million, is it still fair to think of that split kind of 70% Dollar Tree and 30% Family Dollar in terms of the impact? I think that was the original split you gave back a couple of quarters ago. \nKevin Wampler: Karen, the -- as you look at the $19 million, it's more skewed to Dollar Tree than the 70%. So the vast majority really relates to Dollar Tree. A small piece of it does relate to Family Dollar. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then, I guess, just in terms of Family Dollar 2.0, I guess, I'm wondering if you could give a little color on what its second year sales lift is? I know it's still early days, but any color there? And I guess, maybe a little color on why you think it's -- you're having more challenges in terms of getting good discretionary spend in those stores? \nGary Philbin: I would say, when we think -- let me answer the second question first. It's still a customer that comes in and I think is responding to what we've done. I mean you just buy consumables on a weekly basis. The discretionary is tied sometimes to the seasons, but more times when I have for our customer, a little more jingle in our pocket across those discretionary categories. So it's a piece of -- always, we got to have the right values in front of our customer, across each of the categories. So maybe a part of this, Karen, I would even say, as we went in just knowing 2,000 stores are going to be disrupted, 1,000 plus at Family Dollar, we went into this year saying this is not the year to not have foot traffic coming in. H2 has been giving that to us. We've been hitting the gas. It's not just been H2 that's driving the comp.\n So all boats have been rising. I think that was important with knowing we were going to have the down stroke on the store initiative going into it. So I think we just had some better compelling values in front of the customer on the consumable side. And not that we didn't give all the thoughts to how we laid out the store, but I think we got to get back to the basics of blocking and tackling on the discretionary side. What was your other piece of the question? \nKaren Short: Year 2, H2 comp. \nGary Philbin: We're early -- I mean, yes, we like the comps. I'd like to -- as we get more stores into this, I mean we just finished up 1,100-change of H2. That profile is -- has stayed consistent with the addition of more stores across geographies, across densification of population. So we do like that. I think as we get into the second year here, it's -- the stores are still cycling some of their grand opening activities from last year. So more to come as we get more stores into that bucket. \nKaren Short: Okay. Can I just have one more question regarding Dollar Tree banner? \nGary Philbin: Sure. \nKaren Short: Is there any variation in terms of the various stores on urban versus suburban versus rural? I mean you kind of gave that 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 comment in terms of the customer response. But is there any pattern on any of those markets in particular? \nGary Philbin: For Dollar Tree? \nKaren Short: Yes. \nGary Philbin: Or Dollar Tree Plus!? No, I would say -- I can't tell you there's a nuance here that really says there's much of a difference. I think it's more about the product, Karen, than anything else at this point. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our final question today from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So Gary, maybe larger picture, how would you assess the health of the low-income consumer today? Any changes to the competitive landscape that you've seen impacting any of your strategies? Or is it best to just think primarily that this is company-specific execution here? \nGary Philbin: Well, listen, we've been building -- rebuilding our execution and rebuilding our banner. So I think that speaks to satisfying this customer. I think that's what H2 calls out that when we get a shopping environment that's compelling, exciting and has the items they want, they will respond to it.\n To answer your question on the customer, listen, I think unemployment's at an all-time low. I think folks in general can find a job these days. I think the opportunity is still, oftentimes, they're one doctor bill or one car repair bill away from not being in such good shape. And that's really our opportunity to make sure that we have the right items to help them navigate a budget from beginning of the month to the end of the month. So I would say things are maybe slightly better because of jobs. But I never like to stray too far from a customer that is keenly focused on value, convenience, and that's the crosshairs of our Family Dollar ought to just win the customer with everything that we've been talking about, with H2 and the entire fleet. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then, Kevin, maybe just a follow-up on gross margin. At the Dollar Tree banner, so this is the second straight quarter of 55 basis points merchandise costs headwind net of freight and 10 basis points of distribution pressure. How do these 2 items specifically shape up in the fourth quarter? And then do you still view 35% of the structural multiyear gross margin for the Dollar Tree concept? \nKevin Wampler: I think as we look at it, as we've said, we look at freight in fourth quarter, we said domestic, we feel like we're headed in a little bit better direction could be flat to slightly down year-over-year. So that's a good news item. Obviously, somewhat offset by the fact that our import freight is going up. So I think overall, I think we would look for the freight effect maybe to be a little less as we go through Q4. I think as we look at just margin in general, obviously, as we've talked about, helium is a component of this. It does affect -- it does have a halo effect on what is one of our biggest departments and one of our most profitable departments.\n And so we feel a little bit of that, but the team is working really hard to create other exciting items within that department that will drive that business, whether we have helium or not, which, obviously, we're working hard to make sure we have helium as well. So some moving pieces there. I would expect, though, that as if we do the things we need to do to execute on improving our freight going forward that you'll see it be less of an issue as we get into Q4 and the new year. \nOperator: And this does conclude our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Randy Guiler for closing remarks. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Aaron, and thank you for joining us for today's call. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss Q4 and full year results is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, March 4, 2020. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Wampler",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Consolidated net sales for the third quarter increased 3.7% to $5.75 billion, comprised of $3.07 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.67 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.5%. On a segment basis, same-store sales for Dollar Tree increased 2.8% and for Family Dollar, increased 2.3%. Overall, gross profit was $1.7 billion compared to $1.67 billion in the prior year's quarter. Gross margin was 29.7% of sales compared to 30.2% in Q3 of 2018. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 60 basis points to 34.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter included merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 55 basis points, primarily due to higher freight costs. And distribution costs increased approximately 10 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation.\n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 24.5% during the third quarter compared with 25.3% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to the following: Merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 30 basis points, driven primarily by an increase in freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise, partially offset by improved initial mark on. Shrink increased approximately 15 basis points resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the quarter. Distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increased payroll costs at the DCs. Occupancy costs increased approximately 10 basis points due to an increase in real estate taxes; and markdown expense increased approximately 5 basis points, resulting from higher clearance activity in the quarter.\n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter increased 30 basis points to 23.5% from 23.2% in the same quarter last year. For the third quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales increased to 22.1% compared to 22% for the third quarter of 2018. The increase was due to store operating costs increased by approximately 15 basis points resulting from increased debit and credit card fee penetration and an increase in loss on disposal of fixed assets from an earlier lease termination in the quarter. Payroll costs decreased approximately 5 basis points, primarily due to lower retirement plan expenses and lower insurance benefit expenses compared to prior year quarter, partially offset by an increase in store hourly payroll due to higher average hourly rates and an additional hours to support store initiatives.\n SG&A expenses for the Family Dollar segment were 22.5% of sales in the third quarter compared to 22.2% of sales for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to the -- of the following. Operating expenses increased approximately 25 basis points, resulting primarily from higher costs related to the disposal of fixed assets in connection with our store optimization initiative. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 10 basis points as a result of the capital investment required to support the H2 initiative.\n Corporate and support expenses increased 10 basis points, primarily related to store support center consolidation costs and higher depreciation. This included approximately $4 million of expenses related to the Q3 2019 discrete costs associated with our store support center consolidation. For the quarter, the company incurred approximately $9 million in total discrete costs, which was consistent with our guidance. On a consolidated basis, operating income was $358.4 million compared with $387.8 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin of 6.2% of sales compared to 7% of sales in last year's third quarter.\n Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $41.5 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.3% compared to 17.1% in the prior year's third quarter. The prior year quarter benefited by $15.7 million based on the company's substantial completion of our analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the net deferred tax liability valuation. The current year tax rate reflects the benefit of statute expirations and the reconciliation of the tax provision to the tax returns.\n For the third quarter, the company had net income of $255.8 million or $1.08 per diluted share as compared to net income of $281.8 million or $1.18 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $433.7 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Our outstanding debt as of November 2 was approximately $4.3 billion. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 125,000 shares for $11.6 million. At quarter end, we had $800 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We'll provide updates on additional share repurchases, if any, following the quarter in which they may occur.\n Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 14.4% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.5%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 6.4%. Our inventory levels reflect the early receipt of imports to mitigate tariffs. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the remainder of the year. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 4.2% from the same period last year and increased 0.9% on a selling square foot basis. Based on store closures, the Family Dollar segment has 5.1% less square footage outstanding.\n Capital expenditures were $279.8 million in the third quarter versus $228.4 million in the third quarter of last year. And for fiscal 2019, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion, consistent with our initial outlook. Depreciation and amortization totaled $160 million for the third quarter and $150.5 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2019, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $635 million.\n We've updated our outlook for fiscal 2019 and have lowered our guidance for Q4 based on the following expected effects. With regard to tariffs and USTR announcement, we estimate that Section 301 tariffs will increase our cost of goods sold by approximately $19 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the fourth quarter if the tariffs are fully implemented. Almost all other costs are due to List 4A as its timing did not allow for significant mitigation. We expect additional pressure on merchandise margins based on lower-margin consumables growing faster than originally forecasted. We expect distribution costs to be higher than originally forecasted, primarily due to payroll cost pressures from higher turnover, which may affect productivity. Expenses related to repairs and maintenance, utilities and depreciation are now expected to have a higher run rate than originally forecast.\n Additional assumptions in our outlook are the calendar considerations for the remainder of the year, which is that there will be 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will negatively impact Q4 sales. We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wages, unemployment levels and completing the company's initiative plans, including H2 renovations and Snack Zones. We estimate year-over-year domestic freight cost as a percentage of sales to be slightly lower in the fourth quarter. Import freight rates, as we noted on last quarter's call, will increase based on our April rate negotiations and beginning in January 2020, as a result of low sulfur fuel requirements for ships. Net interest expense will be approximately $41.9 million in Q4. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our outlook for currency rate changes. As always, our outlook assumes no additional share repurchases.\n Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.3% for the fourth quarter and 21.4% for fiscal 2019. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.7 million shares for Q4 and 238.2 million shares for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $6.33 billion to $6.44 billion in diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.70 to $1.80. These estimates are based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and year-over-year square footage growth of 1.1%. For fiscal 2019, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $23.62 billion and $23.74 billion based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase of approximately 1.1% selling square footage growth. Company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for the full fiscal 2019 will range between $4.66 and $4.76, which includes a discrete cost of approximately $85 million or $0.28 per diluted share, approximately $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share of store closure-related costs and approximately $19 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to tariffs.\n I will now turn the call back over to Gary. Michael, it's Kevin. I think as we look at it, the items we called out, obviously, the shift in mix as we've seen the -- basically, the consumable business outpaced even what we had forecasted. And really, that's in both brands, more so in the Family Dollar brand and the Dollar Tree brand, but it's in both brands. So the Dollar Tree brand, we've got some good things going with frozen food, refrigerated and in center aisle as well. So a lot of things going on there. And again, a little bit of overall effect from the helium shortage and the halo effect to the party department in general.\n On the Family Dollar side, obviously we haven't seen the discretionary business kick in, as well as we'd like it to, Gary, what he was just speaking to. A lot of opportunity there, getting customers in the door is key, obviously, and getting the foot traffic and having that opportunity to sell them that discretionary item is very, very important. I think as we obviously look at other pieces of the business, obviously, we called out DC costs. Really, this is not an area we've called out in the past so much. It's really been more of a -- more -- a bigger topic as of late as we've gone into the, what we would call our seasonal peak here in the end of Q3 and beginning of Q4 as we look at basically getting all the merchandise through these buildings. And with unemployment where it's at, it's obviously required us to bring up basically starting wages and making sure we can engage with those associates and train them appropriately. Michael, as we said before, that was at a point in time with what we knew at that point in time. Obviously, we're working through and finishing up our 2020 plans. Obviously, the biggest unknown as we sit here today for us and many other retailers is tariffs and where does that land at the end of the day. So obviously, we're committed to improving our business and improving on the many things we've talked about already this morning, but whether -- we'll give, obviously, guidance when we get to our fourth quarter call. And hopefully, we'll have some clarity around all those things. Paul, this is Kevin. I think as we look at it, again, we don't give guidance by banner. Obviously, when you look at it from a -- what I can give you a little feel for, for Q4, is, if you look at the guidance we gave today and you can back into a range of operating income based on all the data we've given you. And I would tell you that it's basically a little -- right around 9% or just above. If you compare that to prior year, excluding the items such as the markdowns for aged goods, clearance of inventory and in-store impairment, I would tell you that the pressure between basically gross profit and SG&A is fairly consistent. So we're seeing pressure on both line items. So that just gives you some directional ability to think about that.\n I think as we look at this year and as we look at obviously the fourth quarter, fourth quarter is a big quarter for Dollar Tree from a seasonal perspective. So we get a pretty good boost in sales just from a seasonal set, which obviously has always provided us the ability to basically provide a good gross margin. And I don't see that in there. But our seasonal set this year performed very well. We had a very good Halloween set. We had a very good performance with our Halloween seasonal, and we feel good about going into the fourth quarter with our Christmas set. So I think that always bodes well. Obviously, we do have the 6 less selling days, but that doesn't mean we're not going to try to make sure we do everything we can to get every last sales dollar that we can at the end of the day. Karen, the -- as you look at the $19 million, it's more skewed to Dollar Tree than the 70%. So the vast majority really relates to Dollar Tree. A small piece of it does relate to Family Dollar. I think as we look at it, as we've said, we look at freight in fourth quarter, we said domestic, we feel like we're headed in a little bit better direction could be flat to slightly down year-over-year. So that's a good news item. Obviously, somewhat offset by the fact that our import freight is going up. So I think overall, I think we would look for the freight effect maybe to be a little less as we go through Q4. I think as we look at just margin in general, obviously, as we've talked about, helium is a component of this. It does affect -- it does have a halo effect on what is one of our biggest departments and one of our most profitable departments.\n And so we feel a little bit of that, but the team is working really hard to create other exciting items within that department that will drive that business, whether we have helium or not, which, obviously, we're working hard to make sure we have helium as well. So some moving pieces there. I would expect, though, that as if we do the things we need to do to execute on improving our freight going forward that you'll see it be less of an issue as we get into Q4 and the new year."

            "name": "Gary Philbin",
            "content": "Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. The third quarter represent another period of solid sales performance for both brands, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Our store optimization efforts and sales driving initiatives are working. The teams have completed more than 1,150 Family Dollar H2 renovations, nearly 200 Dollar Tree rebanners and more than 1,000 Dollar Tree Snack Zones and launched our Dollar Tree Plus! test already this year. These efforts have driven top line sales and transaction counts at both banners.\n Fiscal 2019 has been a unique year as a result of several factors. We planned and accomplished the material acceleration of our Family Dollar store optimization initiatives and the consolidation of our 2 support centers to Chesapeake, Virginia. Additionally, the global helium shortage, which has an outsized impact on our party business, and the continued uncertainty regarding trade and the related tariffs have impacted our business. I'm proud of our team's efforts and the sales execution through this environment.\n We worked hard to maintain focus on our customers and our values in store. Our results for the third quarter included sales increase of 3.7% to $5.75 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increase of 2.5%, and our EPS of $1.08 was within our guidance range. Other highlights for the quarter included completing 247 Family Dollar H2 renovations, completing 512 Dollar Tree Snack Zones, bringing our total to 2,087 across the chain, and repurchasing $11.6 million (sic) [ 125,048 ] shares as part of our share buyback program.\n And in mid-October, we hosted our fourth annual nationwide hiring event focused on hiring more than 25,000 associates in communities all across the country. This event provides individuals with the opportunity to join the Dollar Tree or Family Dollar teams. These new associates can earn the opportunity to be promoted through the field organization. As a growth company, we're always looking for talent and [ better ] strength that can develop into future leaders in our stores. Our application flow was strong for the successful hiring event.\n Regarding Dollar Tree segment sales highlights for the third quarter, we delivered a 2.8% comp, representing the 12th consecutive quarter of comps exceeding 2%. Dollar Tree had increases in both traffic and ticket, with traffic slightly outpacing the ticket increase. Geographically, all zones comped positively and were at or better than 2%. Strongest performing zones were in the Northeast, the upper Midwest and Southwest. Our cadence of comps in the quarter, all 3 months, were better than 2%, with August being the strongest month. Dollar Tree continues to deliver solid positive comps in the consumables category. And our seasonal business continued to perform very well. In fact, Halloween was on par with a very good seasonal sell-through we've been experiencing over the past couple of years.\n Our variety business, which includes party at Dollar Tree, comped positive each month during the quarter, but was again impacted by the helium shortage. We estimate that our comp was negatively impacted from lost balloon sales by about 20 basis points. We expect this helium shortage headwind to continue, but to a lesser degree, for the remainder of 2019.\n The Dollar Tree merchant team continued to do a terrific job of delivering ever-changing and new product ideas that drive customer excitement and repeat visits. Dollar Tree WOW is the excitement that our customers have come to expect. Snack Zones have started, 27 we have rolled out to great success, and we continue to extend this initiative into more Dollar Tree stores. Last year, we added Hallmark cards to all stores across the chain. It has proven to be a great partnership, and customers certainly love the Hallmark brand, the offering and the value.\n And this year, we've been rolling out a new program called Crafters Square. Crafters Square is now in more than 600 Dollar Tree stores and is our new and expanded selection of arts and crafts supplies, all priced at $1. Feedback from stores and customers has been fantastic, and we'll continue to expand this traffic-driving initiative to more stores going forward. The sharing of projects within the crafting community on Pinterest, Instagram and other platforms has made this one of the quickest launches to our customers on a small base of only 600 stores.\n Let me give you an update on Dollar Tree Plus! As we've discussed previously, we are conducting a test of multi-price points at select Dollar Tree stores. The multi-price points -- multi-price assortment is an increment of $2, $3, $4 and $5, is being tested in 115 stores. We just reached the 6-month mark in the initial stores, as the majority of the test stores were added in June. And we're closely monitoring performance, including impacts to traffic, sales, margin and, of course, customer feedback. As always with tests, we follow an iterative process where we test, learn, modify and improve along the way.\n Our focus regarding multi-price point tests as we finish this year and move into 2020 will be on delivering great values to our shoppers within targeted categories, shifting more towards discretionary and unique products that we believe delivers the WOW factor to consumers and is additive to the basket and margin profile. Utilizing our broad vendor base to source these great value products, ensuring, as always, that we protect the Dollar Tree brand. Our brand is more than the items we sell for $1. The Dollar Tree brand represents a pricing value and that the customers get tremendous value for what they spend at Dollar Tree. Our efforts to drive this test should include extending our reach by adding great value, exciting merchandise and opportunities to expand margin. We are still early in this test and look forward to updating you as the test evolves.\n Family Dollar team delivered another quarter of positive comps with a 2.3% increase. Importantly, comparable transaction count for the quarter was positive, continuing the trend that began to emerge in midsummer. Team's performance demonstrates that efforts to prove the consistency of execution across the chain and efforts to drive H2 performance are working and are gaining traction.\n Our Family Dollar segment highlights for the third quarter. Our consumables business performed very well, delivering its 12th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our cadence of comps through the quarter, all 3 months, were better than 1.5%, with August being the strongest month. From a zone perspective, comps for 6 of our 7 zones were positive, with the strongest performance in the West, Southwest and Southeast zones. Our Family Dollar customer service scores for Q3 showed improvement from the prior year. Categories of store cleanliness, product assortment, speed of checkout were among the notable improvements.\n We continue to believe we are taking the right steps to transform our customer experience to increase the frequency of the business. These steps include improving customer satisfaction, developing brand and price reputation, focusing on opening price points, incorporating better organized and focused Dollar impact sections and serving more of what our customers need, including frozen foods. And as we expected, the average scores for H2 stores, where we have invested in our fleet, are higher across the board. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our H2 store format of Family Dollar. All new and remodeled stores are in this format, which is driving greater loyalty, repeat visits and value perception in these locations. These renovated stores continue on average to deliver a comp greater than 10% in their first year post renovation. We are committed to this format and plan to renovate at least 1,000 Family Dollar stores to the H2 format in fiscal 2020. We began rolling out the H2 format in Q3 last year. We continue to like the sales that we are seeing in the H2 stores, now cycling into their second year.\n Our efforts to drive performance across the store base continue to focus on initiatives around our private brands with compare and save, our smart coupons that offer our loyal customers the latest and best values. Hallmark cards will be coming to all Family Dollar stores in 2020. And of course, our store manager training and retention efforts, as always, to drive performance and consistency store by store.\n In our store support center, we are seeing the benefits of having our teams, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, together in one location. We anticipate being together will greatly enhance our culture, our ability to recruit great talent and improve the collaboration within our organization as we train and develop and provide even more and better support for our stores.\n Looking at real estate for both segments in the third quarter. We opened a total of 165 new stores, 114 Dollar Trees, 2 in Canada and 51 Family Dollars. We relocated or expanded 12 Dollar Tree and 3 Family Dollar stores. We renovated 247 Family Dollars as a part of our H2 renovation initiative, and we rebannered 39 Family Dollars to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 463 projects during the quarter. We also added freezers and coolers into 138 Dollar Tree stores, bringing our total to stores with freezers and coolers to just over 6,000. During the quarter, we closed 42 stores, 12 Dollar Trees and 30 Family Dollars, and we ended the quarter with 15,262 stores: 7,447 Dollar Trees, 7,815 Family Dollars.\n Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I'd like to provide a brief update on tariffs. Just prior to our last earnings announcement in August, the USTR announced that tariffs on List 1, 2 and 3 products will increase from 25% to 30% on October 1. Tariffs on List 4A products would increase from 10% to 15% on September 1, and tariffs on 4B products would increase also from 10% to 15% on December 15. As noted in our August earnings announcement, our outlook provided at that time did not include any impacts related to these changes. Our updated outlook includes approximately $19 million of cost of goods sold, with the expected impact from USTR tariffs for List 1, 2 and 3 as well as List 4A and 4B tariffs, if fully implemented, in Q4. Nearly all the expected impact is related to the introduction of List 4A tariffs.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Thanks, Kevin. Like I mentioned at the beginning of the call, 2019 has been a year of distinct opportunities. We planned and executed the material acceleration of our Family Dollar store optimization initiatives, snack Zone resets at more than 1,000 Dollar Tree stores and the consolidation of our 2 banners to our store support center in Southeast Virginia. We accomplished this against the backdrop of the helium shortage, the uncertainty regarding trade and related tariffs, continued impact of freight costs and DC costs affected by the increasing starting wage rates. I'm proud of the sales results at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar that were accomplished in the quarter. This was done in the first 3 quarters of the year with more than 2,000 stores disrupted from our initiatives. We invested in our stores, our starting rates in specific markets and have our fleet of stores ready for the fourth quarter and the key holidays.\n As stated in today's press release, we also announced that we will do at least another 1,000 H2 renovations in 2020. Our confidence in this model grows as we have more across our fleet of stores and various types of settings, demographics and densities of population. We will announce our new RILA and other store level capital plans for 2020 at the end of Q4.\n The impact on our gross margin in specific areas is ours to control and do better. We are focused on making improvements across several categories as we finish the year and start 2020. These areas include improving our shrink results, enhancing efficiencies within our supply chain to better manage freight costs, driving sales on the discretionary side of our business to reduce mix headwinds to margin, and tariff mitigation efforts.\n For shrink, our plans are focused on enhancing allocations and right-size inventories to all of our stores, especially those with a high shrink history; continued focus on training throughout our field leadership, districts and store teams; adding loss prevention tools within our stores; and last week, we're pleased to bring on seasoned, experienced retail executive in a senior VP role to lead both our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar asset protection teams. The asset protection teams from both banners will report to him effective immediately, and our visibility to market issues, external and internal, will be enhanced with the combined teams in priority high shrink markets. Our opportunities across our supply chain and freight costs are focused on optimizing our less than truckload inbound costs, fitting our key freight lanes, continuing to reward our best carriers by [ building ] that deliver on cost and service and getting back to our historical backhaul levels.\n On the discretionary side, at Dollar Tree, we are working hard to overcome our helium shortage with more party-centered items to service our customers. For Family Dollar, we like what H2 has done for the top line and transactions, focusing specifically around the impact on driving more discretionary within our stores. This includes our WOW tables, our dollar impact sections and the queuing assortment at checkout. We still have more runway for all of these discretionary sales in these areas. We're building on important categories that are doing well, especially around mom with kids across a combination of all things needed for young kids, including infant apparel and baby needs. Enhancing our party footprint with the addition of Hallmark-branded cards and Family Dollar through the first half of 2020.\n For tariff mitigation, we are planning to continue efforts to mitigate ongoing and potential new levels of tariffs as we head into 2020. These efforts include the continued support of many vendors to lower costs, the redesign of product or packaging, efforts to shift mix between higher and lower cost products, awarding volume from multiple vendors to our most competitive suppliers, moving product out of China to affect lower landed cost of goods and our combined teams' purchasing power throughout all of Asia. And as always, finding new vendors domestically and in other countries to develop the new and exciting values that our customers have come to expect. We are in the planning stages for 2020, and we'll provide details related to 2020 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.\n I believe our store teams are well prepared for the holiday season. I would like to sincerely thank each of our associates as we head into the fourth quarter and holiday season. More than 15,000 stores across the U.S. and Canada, our network of 25 distribution centers and, of course, our store support center in Virginia. Thank all of them for their commitment, dedication and efforts to deliver value and convenience to our shoppers each and every day.\n Finally, we continue to focus and make meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both brands. We are well-positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increased value for our shareholders. The combination of more than 15,000 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers in all types of markets. The combination of 2 great brands provides great flexibility in managing our future growth.\n Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Scot, this is Gary. We're pleased with H2 because when we went into this, we knew we were adding in more frozen food doors and some more food that obviously has an impact on margin. But we also went into it with the thought of let's offset that with some of what we do on immediate consumption, the queuing lines, the WOW tables. I just think some better adjacencies to run the store. Early on, we saw some degradation in margin. But as we sit here now, H2 is neutral to the fleet, but we didn't do this to be neutral. I really -- our goal here is to have margin expansion within H2. So we're on the right path. We've got traffic going in these stores. And obviously, you've heard us call out that comp. Our next workflow is maintain all that and add margin expansion to H2. We like everything that the customers are telling us about it. We like the results on the top line and sales, and we got to get going on the margin mix now. Well, I've always said we need to get to an inflection point on the fleet. We were rebuilding the stores, basically one store at a time with H2. We did over 1,000 in the first 3 quarters this year. We're planning on doing 1,000 next year. I need the top line sales. I think that's what H2 has given us. The work on the margin, Q3 for Family Dollar, I think it was about an 80 points difference year-over-year comparison. The expansion that can rise across the whole fleet are some of the things I talked about. We got to focus on the discretionary seasonal apparel, electronics. All those are the categories that I think get teed up in the right way in H2. It doesn't mean that the rest of the fleet can't benefit from some of the same elements and efforts across the fleet. So we're putting together our '20 plan with specific initiatives around those discretionary categories to drive the -- maybe get the same benefit that we've really seen on the consumables side. We've got more folks coming through the front door here. And that is as important as anything that we do and now I got to get them over to the other side of the store to buy more of the discretionary product. That's doable. More to come when we announced our 2020 plan. Michael, Gary. I would just add this. Keep in mind, this was a year that was everything we talked about at the beginning of the year. The store initiatives, 2,000 stores at various times torn up. Keep in mind, at the DC level, we were also not just shifting rebanners back and forth, we are also shifting product back and forth, especially with the impact of our Dollar sections in some of our WOW items. So along the way, we combined a store support center, too. With all those balls in the air, I give credit to our store teams and our store support teams to get that done. Everything we're talking about here gives us the consistency, visibility as we go forward in '20. We have done all this, really, with major initiatives, both in our store base, in our store support center. So listen, the things that we're focused on are the right things to drive the business. And with all that going on, we drove sales throughout the year. And with H2 stores, building momentum throughout the year, I'm really pleased with where we will end up on the top line and the initiatives around the margin piece, we got to get after on each of them. Paul, this is Gary. Let me sort of answer your question. What's temporary and start with Dollar Tree. The things that have we've been chasing this year start with shrink. It's a both banner issue. But shrink is something I have an expectation that we're going to do better on next year. We're coming off of a second year of not great performance, and we can do better. I think the freight piece, we started talking about it last year was certainly a bigger impact in the first half. We're going to see some of that modify in the second half, but we're still significantly up year-over-year.\n And the distribution costs, I think, listen, I don't know if it's temporary or not. I know that it impacts us when we have more folks coming into a DC. And it's really not even what you had to pay for us again the DC. It's almost the productivity that you lose in the DC because you've got new folks that you got to train and retain. Those are the things that I think were the one-offs for both banners that I would expect us to make improvement on in the initiatives we talk about.\n The mix on product, to me, is a bigger issue at Family Dollar than it is at Dollar Tree. We are happy with what H2 has done. But across 2019, we've worked hard on keeping sales going. And we just got to find some of the same elements that drive customer traffic into those sections as they do on the consumables. For Dollar Tree, I don't know how to think about tariffs. But it's always just going to be about incorporating the next WOW into the stores. We'd like what Snack zone has done for a little pressure on mix. That's why we got Crafters Square going. A year before that, we started out in Snack Zone, but we put in the Hallmark. So it's always what we push and pull to drive customers on both foot traffic and sales and margin. We're going to do that again as we go into '20. So those are going to be the pieces that we talk about category by category. Hope that's helpful. Peter, this is Gary. Yes. List 1, 2 and 3, I think the teams have been through a couple of cycles now of working with our vendors to either at lower cost or redesign packaging, so we can land it. And in some cases, we're moving outside of China, as you've heard us talk about. And even on this last trip, as we are buying already fall and Halloween next year, we've moved additional product out of China. So you're not going to be able to pick up that entire supply chain. But that's where we do sometimes, item by item, vendor by vendor, as we see those opportunities.\n As we go into 4A and 4B, it's more of our product. And as always, I want to go into 2020, I think, with some compelling product, and we're going to do the smart things around what we have to do to do the best we can to mitigate. I've also told our merchant teams, at the end of the day, I want to be able to see what it is. We might be changing or the opportunity to move price away from a vendor to another country before we do it.\n So 4A, what we've seen is when it gets announced and we don't have much time to mitigate, that's what we're calling out with the Q4 impact. Going forward, when we get a chance to get on our regular cycle buy and meet with our vendors, yes, we can mitigate more of it. I just don't have a full vision of that until we go on a big buying trip in January, which will be our first time really to meet with all of our vendors. And I'm assuming at that point, 4B is in effect as well. No. Well, you heard me talk a little bit about an H2 4-wall margin is about neutral to the fleet, and so that the overall mix change that we're experiencing is no different at H2. What's different is that we invested heavily with more of our lower-margin frozen food and additional expansion of some key categories in center of the store food as well. That's lower margin. That's been offset, you're exactly right, with the impact of the dollar sections, with the queuing assortment, with Dollar WOW tables, with immediate consumption.\n So the fact that we're back to fleet neutral margin, I think, shows the power of some of those sections we just got hampered up another level to get margin accretion going in H2 stores. So the way I look at with the team, we almost take a look at, here's the sections we've invested in, what's our sales and margin on a frozen food category and is that being offset with some of those other sections. And that's pretty much what we're seeing right now. I would say, as folks come in, I would say it's 1/3 folks have seen the product and buy it, 1/3 of our loyal customers have commented that they don't like the multi price go in our stores and 1/3 are somewhere in the middle. Here's my view from everything we've interviewed our customers with. It's not -- so far, we've had a priority on more consumables, which I think were an item that we want to just get out there across categories.\n The next phase of the test is more about what I would call the Dollar Tree WOW side of it. We went over on our buying trip this July to buy specific categories. So I would call them more on our variety, discretionary side, things that people haven't seen. And we'll see how customers respond. But I think that's more to what our customers are going to enjoy seeing incredible values on and allow us into our Dollar Tree WOW umbrella to say, \"that's a great item I don't see anywhere else. And I know that costs more when I do see it.\" And I think that's going to be what we push on into some of this showing up in stores now, but into 2020.\n So when we get a chance to test and learn and put new products in, especially when we can design them and import them or find discretionary items domestically, I just think that's going to be the next phase of the test that gives us another important data point. Our customers that buy it tend to buy more than the average Dollar Tree transaction, but I go back to what success, and success in this is really to increase the reach of Dollar Tree to another segment of customers, another chance to increase margin as well, and as always, protect the brand to say this is the WOW factor at Dollar Tree. So those are the things that are in the mix. I think we have some exciting product coming in, and we stay close to watching that week by week. Well, we are seeing some modest year-over-year declines right now with it. And the things that we're doing, we're in control. But we need to bid out the process. Now somebody has to sign up for the lower bid and give us great service, both on inbound and outbound, to get those rates. So I'd like to think that it's something that as we read some of the same headlines, we are not in the same position as the truck driver shortage exactly at this time a year ago. I think that bodes well for us. The opportunity when we get better service on the outbound, allows us to do more backhauls. So we're going to go into 2020, pushing all the levers we know to do to get both lower freight and better service, and we'll understand better once our important third-party suppliers and independent truckers continue to give us service as we expect to as we finish out Q4 into 2020. Well, we do take a look where is the number of stores. We went into this knowing that we want to fix some of the oldest stores in the fleet. So based on the last year talks, we went into with the best opportunity based on volume. We did need a certain size. And really, what we're skating to is, by the time we face these next 1,000, we ought to be close to 40% of our fleet or a little better, being less than 5 years old. And I think to your point, that does give our customer give a perception of what they've seen at Family Dollar. So it's not necessarily that everything has to be H2. We've got some great stores out there that are not, but we are changing the face of what the customer sees with this store initiative, along with what we closed, along with what we rebannered to Dollar Tree. So the combination of all those things gets us closer to an inflection point, which is I think what you're talking about, what does that customer see. And inside the store, the consistency around store standards, conditions and stocks are important across all the factors of the different stores that we run. So that's what we're aiming for. And as we get more and more stores with the same opportunity, we're still measuring it what's our biggest return on capital as we go and invest in these stores. But I think just by the nature of our fleet with where we are across the country, we're starting to get some critical mass into some key geographies. Well, we've already said, we're in the low 20s as a brand, which is pretty darn good. I mean, it's not grocery store-esque because we're not a grocery store. But I think across the categories, what I would like to see is something closer to 100 basis point improvement consecutively over a number of years. I think that's the opportunity in front of us. And I think it speaks to, one, having great product and values in store. And number two, our customer just needs it because she's stretching her budget and the commitment on what we compare and save to national brands, I think, fits in our wheelhouse. I think the magic to it, as always, is introducing customers because they'll step up to private brands on something that first is something that they try on because it's a detergent, and then they'll go to HPA products, and then we'll go to food products. And the team has done a wonderful job on rebranding across the different categories. And I think that's opportunity still with runway to it. I would say, when we think -- let me answer the second question first. It's still a customer that comes in and I think is responding to what we've done. I mean you just buy consumables on a weekly basis. The discretionary is tied sometimes to the seasons, but more times when I have for our customer, a little more jingle in our pocket across those discretionary categories. So it's a piece of -- always, we got to have the right values in front of our customer, across each of the categories. So maybe a part of this, Karen, I would even say, as we went in just knowing 2,000 stores are going to be disrupted, 1,000 plus at Family Dollar, we went into this year saying this is not the year to not have foot traffic coming in. H2 has been giving that to us. We've been hitting the gas. It's not just been H2 that's driving the comp.\n So all boats have been rising. I think that was important with knowing we were going to have the down stroke on the store initiative going into it. So I think we just had some better compelling values in front of the customer on the consumable side. And not that we didn't give all the thoughts to how we laid out the store, but I think we got to get back to the basics of blocking and tackling on the discretionary side. What was your other piece of the question? We're early -- I mean, yes, we like the comps. I'd like to -- as we get more stores into this, I mean we just finished up 1,100-change of H2. That profile is -- has stayed consistent with the addition of more stores across geographies, across densification of population. So we do like that. I think as we get into the second year here, it's -- the stores are still cycling some of their grand opening activities from last year. So more to come as we get more stores into that bucket. Sure. For Dollar Tree? Or Dollar Tree Plus!? No, I would say -- I can't tell you there's a nuance here that really says there's much of a difference. I think it's more about the product, Karen, than anything else at this point. Well, listen, we've been building -- rebuilding our execution and rebuilding our banner. So I think that speaks to satisfying this customer. I think that's what H2 calls out that when we get a shopping environment that's compelling, exciting and has the items they want, they will respond to it.\n To answer your question on the customer, listen, I think unemployment's at an all-time low. I think folks in general can find a job these days. I think the opportunity is still, oftentimes, they're one doctor bill or one car repair bill away from not being in such good shape. And that's really our opportunity to make sure that we have the right items to help them navigate a budget from beginning of the month to the end of the month. So I would say things are maybe slightly better because of jobs. But I never like to stray too far from a customer that is keenly focused on value, convenience, and that's the crosshairs of our Family Dollar ought to just win the customer with everything that we've been talking about, with H2 and the entire fleet."

Today's conference is being recorded. \n At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Guiler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Cathy. Good morning and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the second fiscal quarter of 2019. Participating on today's call will be our President and CEO, Gary Philbin; our Family Dollar President, Duncan Mac Naughton; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler.\n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in the most recent press release, most recent 8-K, 10-Q and annual report, which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements and you should not expect us to do so. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] \n Now I'll turn the call over to Gary Philbin, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer. \nGary Philbin: Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. \n As we reported today, the turnaround of the Family Dollar business continues to gain momentum. Family Dollar same-store sales increase of 2.4% was the third consecutive quarter of sequential acceleration and represented a 160 basis point improvement in the 2-year stacked comp. And despite sales headwinds created by the global helium shortage, Dollar Tree segment delivered a same-store sales increase of 2.4% while cycling a strong 3.7 increase from the prior year's quarter. Dollar Tree has now delivered 46 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales and 8 consecutive quarters of 2-year stacked comps exceeding 6%. \n I'm proud of the team's accomplishments. During the quarter, we successfully consolidated our store support centers and, as planned, closed 296 Family Dollar stores as part of our store optimization efforts. Additionally, we completed 542 Family Dollar renovations into the H2 format.\n Our results for the second quarter included a sales increase of 3.9% to $5.74 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 2.4%. Our GAAP EPS of $0.76 exceeded our $0.64 to $0.73 per share guidance range. Other highlights for the quarter included completing 542 Family Dollar H2 renovations, completing $275 Dollar Tree Snack Zones, repurchasing 88.4 million of shares during the quarter as part of our share buyback program. At the end of July, we formally moved all business to the Chesapeake, Virginia campus. This represented the work over the past year to bring all functions and especially our merchant teams together. While we still have associates in the moving process, we now have one physical location to conduct our business.\n Regarding Dollar Tree's sales highlights for the second quarter. Dollar Tree had increases in both traffic and ticket with traffic slightly outpacing the ticket increase. Geographically, all regions comped positively. \n Cadence of comps through the quarter. All 3 months were better than 1.5% with June being the strongest month. Dollar Tree continued to deliver solid positive comps in the consumables category. Our discretionary business also comped positive but was impacted by the global helium shortage. We estimated that our comp was negatively impacted from lost balloon sales by approximately 40 basis points. We expect this helium shortage headwind to continue, but to a lesser degree, in the back half of the year. The first half is more impacted with the timing of our biggest balloon holidays, Valentine's Day, Mother's and Father's Day as well as school graduations. \n For real estate. In the second quarter for both segments, we opened a total of 150 new stores, 107 Dollar Trees, 43 Family Dollars. We relocated or expanded 17 Dollar Tree and 2 Family Dollar stores. We renovated 542 Family Dollar stores as part of our H2 renovation initiative, and we rebannered 106 Family Dollars to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 817 projects during the quarter. We also added freezers and coolers into 210 Dollar Tree stores during the second quarter, bringing our total of Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 5,970.\n During the quarter, we closed 305 stores, 9 Dollar Trees in consistent with our previous announced efforts to optimize our real estate portfolio of 296 Family Dollar stores. We ended the quarter with 15,115 stores, split out 7,306 Dollar Tree stores and 7,809 Family Dollars.\n Last week, we opened up our 24th U.S. distribution center located in Morrow County, Ohio, on time, on budget. The 1.2 million-square-foot facility is creating approximately 400 jobs in Central Ohio and will initially be serving Dollar Tree stores. It is equipped with the necessary system to serve both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments in the future. I would call out the partnership and support we received from the State of Ohio, Morrow County and the surrounding communities has been just outstanding. \n Before I turn the call over to Duncan to discuss the Family Dollar business, I'd like to provide you all an update on tariffs. We have been operating in unique times, to say the least, as it relates to tariffs. \n As I stated 1 quarter ago, our merchandising teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating the effects of the 25% tariffs imposed under Section 301 for Chinese goods included on Lists 1, 2 and 3. Prior to the recent USTR announcements on List 4 as well as the additional 5% tariff increase on all lists, we believe our team has successfully mitigated most of the adverse effects of the Section 301 tariffs. We've negotiated price concessions, canceled orders, modified specs, evolved product mix and diversified vendors. We are now taking actions to mitigate the recently announced tariff increases, and we'll continue to assess the future impact of those tariffs. Our merchandising team is experienced, committed and talented. They have developed a tested and proven process for mitigating costs and have the metrics in place to track and measure success. The team will continue to focus on delivering great values to our customers while managing and protecting margins. \n I'll now turn the call over to Duncan. \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. \n Before discussing Family Dollar's performance, I'd like to share details regarding a significant organizational milestone that we recently achieved. Effective July 22, we have successfully consolidated our store support centers into Chesapeake, Virginia. This was a large complex task that required effective communication, collaboration and teamwork throughout the organization. I'm proud of our team's attitude, commitment and determination throughout this process. Many of our associates stepped up to relocate with the organization and are now settling in the Southeast Virginia area. I'd also like to salute and recognize those who could not or chose not to relocate, but they stayed on through July to facilitate a smooth transition. The benefits of having our brands together in one location are simply immeasurable. \n The Family Dollar team is already seeing the benefits from the stability of having a clear vision of the direction and future of our company. The Family Dollar team delivered another quarter, a sequential improvement in comps with a 2.4% increase. The team's performance demonstrates that our efforts to improve the consistency of execution across our stores and our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio are working and gaining traction. We continue to believe that we're making the right steps to transform our customer experience to increase the frequency of their visits. \n Regarding Family Dollar sale -- sales highlights for the second quarter. An increase in average ticket drove the same-store sales increase in the quarter as year-over-year transaction count was essentially flat. Our consumable business performed very well, delivering its 11th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. \n Regarding the cadence of comps during the quarter. May was up against the strongest compare from a year ago and was slightly positive, and June and July were the strongest months of the quarter. And notably, year-over-year traffic turned positive. From a regional perspective, comps for all 7 zones were better than 1% with the strongest performance in the West, Southeast and Southwest. \n A few weeks ago, we conducted Family Dollar's Annual Leadership Conference. This conference brings together our field leadership team and business leaders to teach, to learn, to network and strategize as we prepare for the very important holiday season. The field leadership teams, they're energized and focused. And they will take that energy back to their respective store teams. Theme of our 2019 meeting was the road to reinvention. We must evolve to be prepared for the future, and we're making smart changes and bold changes in our business at Family Dollar. As demonstrated by 3 consecutive quarters of improved comps, our customers are giving us credit for the improvements they're seeing in our stores, which include our H2 renovations, which continue to deliver low double-digit lift; and our grand reopening events are effectively getting the word out to the local communities.\n Key components for the H2 renovations are $1 STOP or $1 WOW sections throughout the whole store, more freezer and cooler doors with a broader selection of products, new signage, new decor with improved queuing lines at checkout, better lighting and much, much more. Our category resets are working. We're seeing material comp lifts post reset. Examples of a reset success include candy, household products and food storage.\n I'm very proud of the work the teams have done on our private brand offerings with improved labels and packaging. These national brand equivalent value-priced products represent an opportunity to deliver great values to our customer while driving customer loyalty, store traffic and profit dollars. \n At Family Dollar, we are on the road to reinvention. The team has delivered positive comps of 1.4%, 1.9% and 2.4% over the past 3 quarters, and I am pleased with the additional trends for the third quarter.\n We have the headquarter move behind us. We have an eager, energized and aligned leadership team and a terrific plan entering the holiday season. I look forward to providing you more updates on our progress in the quarters ahead.\n I will now turn to Kevin to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and our updated outlook for 2019. \nKevin Wampler: Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. \n Total sales for the second quarter increased 3.9% to $5.74 billion comprised of $2.96 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.78 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.4%. And on a segment basis, same-store sales for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar increased 2.4%. \n Overall, gross profit was $1.65 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year's quarter. As a percent of sales, gross margin was 28.7% compared to 30.1% in Q2 of 2018. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 70 basis points to 33.8% when compared to the prior year quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter included merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 55 basis points primarily due to higher domestic outbound freight costs and an increase in the mix of lower-margin consumables sold; distribution costs increased approximately 10 basis points due to higher payroll costs; and occupancy costs increased approximately 5 basis points on the lower comp compared to the prior year. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 23.3% during the second quarter compared with 25.7% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to the following: markdown expense increased approximately 100 basis points resulting from store closure, rebanner and renovation markdowns, as anticipated, as part of our store optimization process; merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 95 basis points primarily due to increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise and slightly higher freight costs; and shrink increased approximately 45 basis points resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the current quarter and from changes to the accrual rate. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales in the quarter increased 80 basis points to 24% from 23.2% in the same quarter last year. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales improved to 22.5% compared to 22.6% for the second quarter of 2018. The improvement was due to the following: store operating costs were lower by approximately 15 basis points due to lower utility costs, specifically electricity resulting primarily from the benefit of the LED lighting program in the stores; payroll costs increased approximately 10 basis points primarily due to an increase in store hourly payroll due to higher average hourly rate partially offset by lower retirement plan expenses. \n SG&A expenses for the Family Dollar segment were 22.7% as a percentage of sales in the second quarter compared to 21.6% for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to the net of the following: operating and corporate expenses increased approximately 95 basis points resulting primarily from the loss of disposable and fixed assets due to the store closure write-offs; and stores' supplies expense to support the H2 initiative; payroll expenses increased approximately 35 basis points primarily due to average hourly rate increases and additional hours, including temporary health expense, to support H2 renovations; and depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 15 basis points as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated or amortized.\n Corporate and support expenses increased 30 basis points as a result of $10.8 million of store support center consolidation costs and higher depreciation. On a consolidated basis, operating income was $268.9 million compared with $382.5 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin was 4.7% of sales compared to 6.9% of sales in last year's second quarter.\n Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $40.5 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% compared to 18.9% in the prior year's second quarter. The quarter and prior year's quarter benefited by $5.8 million and $8.1 million, respectively, for a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions resulting from statute expirations. \n For the second quarter, the company had net income of $180.3 million or $0.76 per diluted share. This compared to net income of $273.9 million or $1.15 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.\n Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $623.4 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of the fiscal 2018. Our outstanding debt as of August 3, 2019, was $4.3 billion. \n During the second quarter, we invested $88.4 million in the repurchase of approximately 882,000 shares. At quarter end, we had $812 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We will provide updates on additional share repurchases, if any, following the quarter in which they occur.\n Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 15.1% from the same time last year while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 7.4%. Our inventory levels reflect the early receipt of imports to mitigate tariffs. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings, rebanners and our sales initiatives for the back half of the year. \n Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 2.3% from the same period last year and increased 3% on a selling square-foot basis. Capital expenditures were $293.3 million in the second quarter versus $213.4 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2019, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion, which is consistent with our initial 2019 outlook. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $155.1 million for the second quarter and $152.5 million in the second quarter of last year. And for fiscal 2019, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. \n Our updated outlook for fiscal 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ] includes the following assumptions. Calendar considerations for the remainder of the year includes the following: there will be 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will negatively impact Q4 sales. With regard to tariffs and the recent USTR announcements, we estimate that without mitigation, List 4A and the additional 5% tariffs on List 1, 2 and 3 would costs the company approximately $26 million in additional tariffs. Our updated outlook does not include the recently announced tariff increases as we are currently working to mitigate these costs.\n Our company outlook on March 6, 2019, included $95 million in discrete costs related to our Family Dollar store optimization initiative and our store support center consolidation. With the increased visibility of our overall costs, we now expect to incur $85 million in discrete costs for the year, of which we've incurred $76 million in the first half of the year. Our Q3 outlook includes the remaining estimated $9 million in costs related to these initiatives. \n We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wage and completing the company's initiative plans. We expect year-over-year domestic freight costs as a percentage of sales to flatten out in the second half while import freight rate, as we noted in last quarter's call, will increase in the back half of the year. Net interest expense will be approximately $41.1 million in Q3 and approximately $162.7 million for fiscal 2019.\n We cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we've not adjusted our outlook for currency rate changes. And as always, our outlook assumes no additional share repurchases. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.4% for the third quarter and 22.1% for fiscal 2019. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.5 million shares for Q3 and 237.6 million shares for the full year.\n For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.66 billion to $5.77 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.16. These estimates are based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and include approximately $9 million of discrete costs.\n For fiscal 2019, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $23.57 billion and $23.79 billion based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and approximately 1.3% square footage growth. \n The company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for full year fiscal 2019 will range between $4.90 and $5.11, which includes discrete costs of $85 million or $0.28 per share and approximately $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share in store-closure-related costs. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Gary. \nGary Philbin: Thank you, Kevin. \n I will share a brief update on our early reads from the Dollar Tree Plus! test. We are in the very early stages of our multi-price point test at select Dollar Tree stores, and we'll continue to closely monitor the results, including impacts to traffic, sales and margins. Some details related to the test are, launched in mid-May, by the end of June, we had the test rolled out to approximately 115 stores. The test includes newly added products at price points of $2, $3, $4 and $5. The products being tested, which currently include about 200 SKUs, are clearly identified as Dollar Tree Plus! items providing customers more choices, more sizes, more savings. We are testing a cross section of high-, moderate- and low-volume stores as well as urban, suburban and rural settings, so we can understand how customers respond in the varying markets. Early in the test, the product mix has leaned more towards consumables, and this will evolve as we move towards the holiday season with more discretionary items added to the test. We've received feedback on the values from our customers on the initial merchandise assortment, and this is critical as we know we want to protect the Dollar Tree brand. Our customers view Dollar Tree as the destination for terrific value for what you spend in $1. \n We are pleased with how our teams have started and implemented the test across varied geographies to our volumes and size. It's giving us valuable insights to how our customers view these values across a Dollar Tree store. Our teams are excited about the evolution of the merchandise assortment as we approach the holiday season. On our most recent import trip, we have bought specifically for Dollar Tree Plus! stores and I think excited about the additional assortment that will resonate with our customers as we go into our holidays.\n Finally, I wanted to share a few words regarding our field leadership meetings that I attended in the past few weeks for both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. This is the opportunity to connect with field leaders face-to-face, teach and learn, recognize, reward all those individuals and teams for performance and service awards. We interact with buyers and sellers. The merchants and our field team work together. We coach and mentor people development and ensure that we are all aligned heading into the important holiday season. We had very productive meetings, and I'm pleased with the focus on business acumen of our businessmen and women that our leading our field organizations. Our leaders are energetic, focused and motivated going into this important back half.\n Operator, we're now ready to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question with Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I wanted to ask about some of the improvement in the Family Dollar comp. To what extent you can tie it to initiatives versus underperforming stores coming out of the comp base versus macro strength? And do you think that we've turned a corner here on a higher run rate? I mean it's been a few quarters now of improved sales. \nGary Philbin: Yes. I'd tell you what, we're pretty excited about the 2.4% comp at Family Dollar. And what's most exciting, to your question, is all boats are rising. We're seeing a great performance in our H2 stores. But to me, what we're seeing is the bulk of the stores are also driving great comp sales. And as I talked about on my prepared remarks, we're now seeing positive traffic across the chain. So that's telling us our customers are liking what we're doing as we clean up our stores. \n As you know, we have roughly 1,000 H2 stores out there, and we closed the quarter with 7,809. So the good news here is we have multiyears to add as we're going to talk about 1,150-or-so stores this year and how do we really change the face of our chain. So I would tell you that we can't -- with that small store base, we can't run the whole comp. So we're seeing the balance of the chain really help there. We did have some help from store closures, but it was not nearly as impactful as the balance of the chain. \nSimeon Gutman: And then in the follow-up, I guess, on margin and the visibility, at what point does the margin improve and sort of follow this top line? And related to it, can you just share with us on the Dollar Tree side how much helium may have hurt the GM and maybe the EBIT for the Dollar Tree business this quarter? \nKevin Wampler: So as we look at the margin, as we look to the back half, obviously, the front half, in particular, was loaded with the discrete costs. As we've said, we have incurred about $76 million of what we now believe is $85 million of costs that we will incur. We look for the gross margin to become much more comparable to last year. It's obviously been down. I think the one thing that we have to always consider is we've been driving our business in the Family Dollar world with consumables. And even in Q2, the Dollar Tree business was driven by consumables based upon what everything we have going on, touching all these stores that we're touching. \n So we're driving traffic. We're getting our core customer back into the store in Family Dollar, and they're liking what they're seeing. It's a little bit more consumable-driven. So our job that we still have ahead of us is to continue to improve our discretionary business, but we do look for the gross margin on the kind of dollar side to start to level out as we go through the back half. \nGary Philbin: And Simeon, this is Gary. Let me add my color to that. For both banners, I think it's important as we went into this year knowing all the stores that were going to be torn up for renovations. H2 at Family Dollar, Snack Zones at Dollar Tree. By the time we were going to get to Q2, we will touch 1,000-plus stores. And by design, not exactly reading the crystal ball as well as you would like, we went in aggressively, closeouts, our WOW product at the Dollar Tree side, a little bit more on consumable side, on the merchandise plan at Family Dollar. So part of that was to make sure we could go through touchy stores, catch them, pull them back together and still drive a positive comp.\n As far as balloons, the impact there was the impact of 40 bps. And that's really just on what we lost on balloon sales in the first half or in the second quarter year-over-year. And obviously, first half, as I called out, is a little more impactful. What we didn't measure was balloon sales usually have a halo effect of everything else in the party department, which is obviously one of our highest margin in a very large business, and it really drives customers to that store. So we know it's not going to be as impactful because the holidays aren't as big, and we'd like to think it's going to get moderately better as we go into '20, but that was probably the best way to measure the balloon impact. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Nice progress, guys. I guess first, at Family Dollar, how best to think about sequential same-store sales improvement opportunity in the back half of the year? Maybe what do you see as top drivers of the traffic inflection at your H2 remodels? And any color on early 3Q trends would be helpful. \nGary Philbin: Yes. I'd tell you what, Matt, thanks for the question. We -- as you can see, our engine is growing. Our traffic is turning positive, and we're driving some real growth with consumables, and our job is to convert that to the discretionary side of the store to enhance our margin throughout the year. We've got a really strong back half plan and a strong holiday plan that we just shared with our leaders at the Annual Leadership Conference. \n And I think year-over-year, you're going to see us continue to strive to grow our comps as we get more H2s on the ground, they mature. And what we're seeing in the balance of the stores is they're really starting to have higher standards at store level, and they're -- so the stores are getting cleaned up. The customer is noticing. And they're getting the components of some of the H2 stores while they may not be an H2 store. So we're trying to fast adapt as we learn what are the key winners in key categories. And we did some -- a number of resets last year that are now going to start cycling and be helpful to comp in the back half. So I feel pretty good about our business plan with comps as we look forward. \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: Matt, and Gary, I would just add. I mean that's part of the energy and why we added more H2s. A showdown to our openers have gotten us ahead of the game to this point to get the 1,000 done by the time we finish up August to your Labor Day weekend, and we had some more runway. So we're up for another 150 to get done mainly through September, a little bit probably into October to give us more H2s on the ground. But to give credit to the Family Dollar team, the consistency of what we're seeing in-store, the work we've done on key resets are I think are what we see as lifting all boats right now. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then as a follow-up, just to help break down margins. Could you help bucket the discrete costs at Family Dollar between the gross margin and the SG&A, both what you saw in the second quarter, how to think about the back half? And larger picture, what's the best way to think about Family Dollar's fundamental gross margin recapture opportunity that you see from here? \nKevin Wampler: Matt, it's Kevin. As -- within my prepared remarks, I tried to get some good color on this. So let's kind of break it down into pieces here, if we can. So obviously, within the press release, we talked about $48 million of discrete costs within the quarter as well as $15 million of store closure costs. Within that -- so that's a total of $63 million or about 230 basis points. And basically, what I did -- if you take out the $10 million of store consolidation expenses, that means about $52 million sat within the Family Dollar segment. And as we called out within the prepared remarks, about 100 -- and that's about 190 bps. And that basically broke down really about 100 bps of markdowns, which you talked about. So you're talking about all the store closures, all the renovations, all the rebanners, everything related around that from that piece. And then on the SG&A side of it, it's all of the asset write-off for all the store closures, and again, we closed 296 stores during the quarter; supplies for the H2 renovations as well as labor, temp labor for the H2 renovations as well. So that's roughly 90, 95 bps. So that's kind of how to bucketize them the best way and the big-picture way.\n As far as a go-forward margin, we have huge opportunities. Obviously, it's been a disappointing year from shrink perspective. We have a lot of opportunity as we go forward. As we talked about last quarter, look forward to start to flatten out in the back half on a comparative basis. A lot of initiatives in process there relating to: one, just changes in leadership and structure, really working on our commitment to training and our execution of policies and procedures; defensive merchandising initiatives, analytics. And again, getting our inventory levels down as well will be very, very helpful in that regard. So I think we have a huge opportunity as we go into next year to help our gross margin in that regard. \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: Matt, let me just chime in because I think -- and just a couple of callouts when I think about, first off, with increased traffic, we can steer this boat. And that's what the H2s are doing and what we're starting to see better in the rest of the fleet. And so an opportunity when somebody comes to the store and sell them compelling merchandise on the discretionary side becomes all the easier. \n Secondly, I got to just tell you, having everybody in the same building now and the merchant teams on the same floor, vendors now meeting both banners at the same time, I can't tell you how excited I am about that. And we are a $25 billion company with a face to the vendor community. We can drive sales. And we will be on the short list of people that come to do that. And then finally, just the continued piece on imports for getting tariffs for a second, if we can, the opportunity to design and create value merchandise that sells at both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree is a big, big impact for us as we look forward. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Just, Duncan, I was wondering if you could amplify on the improvement in traffic in the quarter. I guess do you think it's new customers that you're gaining? Or is it existing customers repeating? And then one for Kevin, just a follow-up on Matt's question because there's a lot of confusion on the gross margin line and Family Dollar, so if I could like ask it from a different way. Just -- can you just sort of look at the onetime costs, both the discrete and the store closures, what that was from a basis point impact versus sort of the normal course of business, i.e., shrink and any markdown activity? \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. As for Family Dollar traffic, I would say that, as we talked about, low double-digit lifts in our H2 stores, about 2/3 of that is coming from traffic. And so we're seeing transactions develop there, and we're seeing a lot of repeat purchases coming. So part of that, as we study the marketplace, we know we're acquiring some new customers from some other folks in the marketplace. So I would tell you that part of it is both our existing customer coming back more often and then getting, acquiring new customers that may have been a Family Dollar customer and through our grand reopening initiative as we communicate back to them that we've got a new Family Dollar for you, why don't you come check it out. And they see what we have to offer and while they may have stopped shopping with us, they come back to us. So we feel real good about that pattern. \n So in the balance of the chain, we're seeing -- I think people are seeing that our store standards have been better, and they're seeing that we've been pretty aggressive with our growth in consumables, and we're working on discretionary side of the business, as Gary talked about, to move that customer over. \n We've also modified our marketing campaign to have more frequencies so that we can be in the marketplace more often, which I'm excited about because we've got a gap there before. So that will close that gap. So I would tell you that it's -- in the H2s, it's some new customers and the rest of the chain, it's both. And I think the good news is those trips are growing up. \nKevin Wampler: And then, Chuck, in regards to your question relating to the Family Dollar margin. Again, really, 3 buckets related to the change year-over-year for the quarter. And again, it was 100 basis points from the markdowns related to the initiatives, about 95 basis points related to increased sales of lower-margin goods, as well as slightly at higher freight and then about 45 basis points related to shrink. So that's really kind of the 3 buckets as we put them in and can best describe for you.\n So I don't know if there's any -- something beyond that, that you're looking for. \nCharles Grom: No. That's helpful. I just wanted to get all the information. And then just on the Tree, just maybe unpack for us the difference between the first and the second quarter gross margin performance, and I guess how you're thinking about it in the back half of the year. \nKevin Wampler: I think if you look at the first quarter, gross profit was roughly flat year-over-year versus this quarter. And so we were impacted more by freight in this quarter than we were the first quarter. And again, a little bit of timing, a little bit of what we've got going on. Again, we did build inventory as well during the quarter with -- from an import standpoint to mitigate tariffs. So there's some effect from that a little bit.\n But overall, as we look at it, I think the idea of freight was the bigger piece. We do look for that to mitigate a little bit as we go through the back half, as we've said. And then the other piece, as we called out, was really the idea that we did sell. We had a better consumable business in the second quarter. And so our sales mix, our margin mix averaged a little lower at the end of the day because of the overall consumable mix. As we go forward, I don't know that we -- as I've said, I don't think that we still expect to see the same type of pressure that we saw in Q2. \nGary Philbin: Yes. And Chuck, I would just give you some color. I think really, the last 2 years, our seasons have gotten out of the gates very quickly and performed very well. All this inventory we brought in to beat the tariffs is there. That's the imports. It's higher margin. As we kick off, really, the fall/harvest season as we get past Labor Day, to me, we are set up to take advantage of what the Dollar Tree does best. And that's getting geared up on the discretionary side of the business. We've invested in consumables to make sure we had the kind of traffic and customer count we needed as we went through all of our Snack Zones. Snack Zones are delivering what we brought across the network. And now let's shift gears a little bit back to what the best time of the year is for Dollar Tree. And that's really September, October on through the Christmas holiday. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question to Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse. \nJudah Frommer: First, to circle back to tariffs. It sounds like you've quantified the potential impact from the increase on Lists 1 through 3 and List 4A, but it's not embedded in the 2019 guide. Is the messaging that you do feel you can fully offset that? Or is the message that you're working to offset and you'll update us with the magnitude of offset at some point? \nGary Philbin: Thanks, Judah. Yes. Short answer. Listen, I mean we're 6 days from the last change, right? So I mean here's how we've gone through the year. The merchant teams had mitigated Lists 1, 2 and 3, as we knew it. Then when List 4A, 4B first came out, we had plans on that and, actually, on our trip to Asia felt very good about where we were on that. And then of course, the most recent changes, make that the callout of our most recent news. Well, the things we're doing are working pretty darn well. I would say the vendor community is stepping up. We have done things like we've said before. We can really work hard on changing how we're packing things or the packaging, on how many units can we get on container so we can land the overall cost lower. We've been able to move, I would say, modestly $100 million on some of the buying trips out of China with our strategy of China plus 1.\n I give credit to our merchants. This is about negotiating a vendor at a time to make those differences, and that's why I went into this call. We see the most -- we want to give you the math to give you some sense of the scale. And really, while it's work we got to do from 6 days ago, I have confidence in the group that we'll mitigate it for the balance of the year. \nJudah Frommer: Okay. Great. And Kevin, you are kind enough with Q4 earnings to give us an early read on next year and the earnings growth related to that. And I think you've been clear that you guys guide on a GAAP basis, but GAAP earnings have moved around quarter-to-quarter as discrete costs kind of come and go. Is there any directional update you can give us on how you're thinking about that earnings growth trajectory for next year? \nKevin Wampler: No. We haven't updated the guidance we gave back in March on that subject. Obviously, we're just kicking off our budget season right now, as we speak, basically, for next year. And I don't think in -- simplest terms, I don't think anything in the base has changed. I think we have the unknown of tariffs and where they go and what they may do. I don't know that we -- any others have an answer for that at this point in time. We'll have to take that into consideration accordingly. But I would tell you the base case, I don't see necessarily a change in our thought process. \nOperator: Your next question is from Joseph Feldman with the Telsey Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I wanted to ask with regard to the new front end that you have at the Family Dollar side of the business, how many stores have that at this point? And like how fast can you get that to all the stores? \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: Joe, thanks for the question. This is Duncan. We've got it obviously in all H2 stores, and we're putting it in all our new stores as well. The key constraint at a store level is kind of the size first and the width, second. And we do have multiple formats of the queuing line. So I will tell you that where we can, we're putting it in because it is very profitable to the store, not only the single-serve beverages that are there. But then again, the -- that front end is quite profitable, both on the snack side as well as -- you probably noticed, we've been putting discretionary items on there. And the team right now is testing another front queuing line that will actually enhance profitability for that front end and really fit the needs of our customer I think better. So it's primarily an H2 initiative at this point is where we're focused. Where we're doing any kind of other renovations, we'll see if it can be accommodated, but it's really the H2 number. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. And then also, just a question on the DCs. I know you guys just opened the 24th new DC. And you made a comment that it's set up for both, but you're only going to start with the Dollar Tree. Can you remind us where you're at with how many, I guess, co-branded DCs that you do have at this point and how many you kind of want to have? \nGary Philbin: Well, we have 1 DC that is in Utah that distributes to both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. We now have 1, 2, 3, 4 additional DCs that have the internal workings and warehouse management system that allows us to deliver to both. We've needed the capacity for the Dollar Tree banner because we have capacity in the Family Dollar network because of their closures, the rebanners. And of course, that's putting pressure on the Dollar Tree banner. So ultimately, it comes down to the size of the building. Any new building that we've done, it comes out now with the ability to deliver either banner, which will be a place that we move to. And that's a stem-mile opportunity for us in the out years. It's right now a function of capacity needed for Dollar Tree banner to make sure we can service those stores. And we pick up, obviously, some stem mile every time we open up a Dollar Tree banner because we have more stores closer to that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: So two quick things. The -- I know there's not a lot of H2s with a lengthy history. But do you guys have a sense of how that format will mature and waterfall in years 2 and 3 comp-wise? Do you think it's above maybe what a new store would do? Like a normal new store, it settles into a more normal waterfall. \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: John, it's Duncan. Thanks for the question. I think it'd probably comp like a regular new store is what we're thinking about. And we've got a handful of them that have kind of cycled themselves. So we're learning quickly, but it's behaving like a new store. \nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. And then maybe for Gary. When you -- again, I know that multi-price point is in its early stages here. But have you found anything interesting when you look at the basket construct of people who have a Dollar Tree Plus! item in there versus those who don't? Are there fewer items when they buy a Dollar Tree Plus!? How is it different? \nGary Philbin: Thanks, John. I would say, at this point, it's purely additive to the basket. So it's telling us, I'm a Dollar Tree shopper. I come in. I like my regular items. And now here is something that surprised me is some of the feedback we hear. And that goes into the what was, \"their regular basket.\" So I think we've start off with some items that are giving us some pretty good information how our customer views it. But what I'm really maybe most excited about is putting a bit more of the Dollar Tree whimsy and surprise of the WOW effect into some of the items. And then that will give us another variant to what customers are buying and especially as we get around holiday time. So more to come. We bought specifically for these stores, and they'll be in addition to the assortment as we continue to evolve and to get the best read we can. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. You commented that you were pleased with 3Q trends at Family Dollar. So I guess I just want to clarify, is that to be interpreted that comps are above kind of where you came in, in 2Q? And then I had another clarification on guidance. \nKevin Wampler: Duncan made that comment. I mean, obviously, I think we're only 3 weeks in. So it's not like we're going to get a whole lot of other information. But I mean we're pleased is where we would state it, that we're not going to make a statement whether it's higher or lower or what it might be, but we're very pleased at this point. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then just with respect to guidance or not guidance, but I guess loose commentary on 2020. I guess there's just a little confusion with respect to the comments you made in March. And I'm asking this question excluding tariffs. But when you think about that 14% to 18%, are you looking at a number that's based on GAAP EPS or adjusted EPS? \nKevin Wampler: We said -- we've always said it's based upon GAAP EPS. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. \nKelly Bania: Just wanted to ask about tariffs. It was helpful to have the quantification I guess of the $26 million over the next couple of months. I guess -- I'm guessing in terms of List 4 that you're still working through that, which is why that wasn't quantified. But maybe you can just talk about order of magnitude, how that would compare to what you're quantifying today, if you can at all. And I guess a couple of other questions related to that. How much have you saved with respect to tariffs by bringing inventory early at multiple points throughout this year? And then is there at all an upper limit to what you think your team can offset here? Do you feel confident that even if you get into next year that this can further be mitigated? \nGary Philbin: Kelly, well, listen, we're managing to what we know, let's start there. So I think what we try to paint a picture of the magnitude for this 4A when we knew it was initially 10%, that was in our sights. And the team went to work right away on 4A knowing that 4B was coming. We had more time on 4B. Once the tariff was increased for both List 4 and List 1, 2 and 3, we just sort of continued to do the same playbook that's been working for us. So everything that I had called out before.\n So we're in the unique times, and we're in unique times where I think there is -- the opportunity is I would tell you that our vendor community is both -- wants to work through this and help, at this moment in time. And prior to this, they are also concerned they might lose business. And some have as we have found other opportunities either inside China or outside China. So there's never just one tune you play to overcome this. So what gives me confidence for the balance of this year is I can see the rocks in front of me and our teams have worked real hard to overcome what we see this year.\n Too early to comment on '20. Shoot, I'm trying to think about what might happen this week or next week. But we are working real hard on what we know today based on the USTR as we go into what's going to be the first increase on September 1 knowing that there's another one in October and then finally, December 15. Those are the ones that we know of right now. \nKelly Bania: And I guess just on the inventory, how much has been mitigated by just bringing inventory in early? \nGary Philbin: You know, we -- I can't in scale on -- of what we sell. I mean we try to bring items in. It's not a huge amount. I mean, of course, you try to bring it in if it's on the water. But keeping in mind it's 6 weeks before you leave a port and it gets somewhere else. And we're often not given 6 weeks to make much of a move. If we can do anything, we do. But it's not meaningful on the scale what we're talking about on cost of goods and the tariffs. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Just a few questions for you. First, I just wanted to ask you about store manager turnover at Family Dollar. I was just hoping you could give us an update on the progress that you're making there and the initiatives that you have in place to improve that. \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: Edward, it's Duncan. Thanks for the question. I would say that store manager turnover has improved slightly. We're still at a level that I'm not happy with. But last year, we focused all our training at our field meeting on year of the manager, which was all about training our people, giving them tools, about hiring the right person, training the right person and retaining the right person. And we gave them many tools and consistent playbooks across the chain to do that. And we -- they've all been trained on that. And we highlighted it again this year and get -- updated those toolkits. And we've had national recruiting fairs, as you're probably aware of. And we've made progress there. It does attract a fair amount of people. \nGary Philbin: And I would just have to call out with some of the same efforts, Dollar Tree is going to have 1 of its best 3 years ever since I've been here on store manager turnover. So I think the initiatives are well focused and pointing at the right things. And we're working real hard to get both banners to -- ought to be a banner year on store manager turnover. \nEdward Kelly: Right. Great. And just to follow up on Dollar Tree Plus! Any color you can provide on timing around a decision in terms of your assessment of the initiatives? And then do tariffs at all -- an escalation of tariffs impact sort of strategically how you're thinking about the Plus! format? \nGary Philbin: Well, on the timing side, listen, I think as we get and evolve the assortment, we're going to learn more. So I can't quite give you a time line. I'm more interested in what can I learn from giving our customers an evolving assortment that will tell us more what resonates with her when she's in a Dollar Tree. \n And as far as tariffs, obviously, anybody out there today who's importing is affected no matter what the price point. It obviously goes into the equation, but it does make you take a look at where you're buying it from. But to hit the mark, you have to really focus on what the customer wants, as always, in retail; and for our Dollar Tree stores, how does that play out. When we take a look at retail, that go up to $5. And I think it's -- that's really what we're focused on. What's in our -- what's our Dollar Tree customer going to look for in our world. And that's where our merchandising teams are very focused on. \nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Guiler, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Cathy, and thank you for joining us for today's call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss Q3 results is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, November 26, 2019. Thank you. \nOperator: That concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Duncan C. Mac Naughton",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. \n Before discussing Family Dollar's performance, I'd like to share details regarding a significant organizational milestone that we recently achieved. Effective July 22, we have successfully consolidated our store support centers into Chesapeake, Virginia. This was a large complex task that required effective communication, collaboration and teamwork throughout the organization. I'm proud of our team's attitude, commitment and determination throughout this process. Many of our associates stepped up to relocate with the organization and are now settling in the Southeast Virginia area. I'd also like to salute and recognize those who could not or chose not to relocate, but they stayed on through July to facilitate a smooth transition. The benefits of having our brands together in one location are simply immeasurable. \n The Family Dollar team is already seeing the benefits from the stability of having a clear vision of the direction and future of our company. The Family Dollar team delivered another quarter, a sequential improvement in comps with a 2.4% increase. The team's performance demonstrates that our efforts to improve the consistency of execution across our stores and our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio are working and gaining traction. We continue to believe that we're making the right steps to transform our customer experience to increase the frequency of their visits. \n Regarding Family Dollar sale -- sales highlights for the second quarter. An increase in average ticket drove the same-store sales increase in the quarter as year-over-year transaction count was essentially flat. Our consumable business performed very well, delivering its 11th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. \n Regarding the cadence of comps during the quarter. May was up against the strongest compare from a year ago and was slightly positive, and June and July were the strongest months of the quarter. And notably, year-over-year traffic turned positive. From a regional perspective, comps for all 7 zones were better than 1% with the strongest performance in the West, Southeast and Southwest. \n A few weeks ago, we conducted Family Dollar's Annual Leadership Conference. This conference brings together our field leadership team and business leaders to teach, to learn, to network and strategize as we prepare for the very important holiday season. The field leadership teams, they're energized and focused. And they will take that energy back to their respective store teams. Theme of our 2019 meeting was the road to reinvention. We must evolve to be prepared for the future, and we're making smart changes and bold changes in our business at Family Dollar. As demonstrated by 3 consecutive quarters of improved comps, our customers are giving us credit for the improvements they're seeing in our stores, which include our H2 renovations, which continue to deliver low double-digit lift; and our grand reopening events are effectively getting the word out to the local communities.\n Key components for the H2 renovations are $1 STOP or $1 WOW sections throughout the whole store, more freezer and cooler doors with a broader selection of products, new signage, new decor with improved queuing lines at checkout, better lighting and much, much more. Our category resets are working. We're seeing material comp lifts post reset. Examples of a reset success include candy, household products and food storage.\n I'm very proud of the work the teams have done on our private brand offerings with improved labels and packaging. These national brand equivalent value-priced products represent an opportunity to deliver great values to our customer while driving customer loyalty, store traffic and profit dollars. \n At Family Dollar, we are on the road to reinvention. The team has delivered positive comps of 1.4%, 1.9% and 2.4% over the past 3 quarters, and I am pleased with the additional trends for the third quarter.\n We have the headquarter move behind us. We have an eager, energized and aligned leadership team and a terrific plan entering the holiday season. I look forward to providing you more updates on our progress in the quarters ahead.\n I will now turn to Kevin to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and our updated outlook for 2019. Matt, and Gary, I would just add. I mean that's part of the energy and why we added more H2s. A showdown to our openers have gotten us ahead of the game to this point to get the 1,000 done by the time we finish up August to your Labor Day weekend, and we had some more runway. So we're up for another 150 to get done mainly through September, a little bit probably into October to give us more H2s on the ground. But to give credit to the Family Dollar team, the consistency of what we're seeing in-store, the work we've done on key resets are I think are what we see as lifting all boats right now. Matt, let me just chime in because I think -- and just a couple of callouts when I think about, first off, with increased traffic, we can steer this boat. And that's what the H2s are doing and what we're starting to see better in the rest of the fleet. And so an opportunity when somebody comes to the store and sell them compelling merchandise on the discretionary side becomes all the easier. \n Secondly, I got to just tell you, having everybody in the same building now and the merchant teams on the same floor, vendors now meeting both banners at the same time, I can't tell you how excited I am about that. And we are a $25 billion company with a face to the vendor community. We can drive sales. And we will be on the short list of people that come to do that. And then finally, just the continued piece on imports for getting tariffs for a second, if we can, the opportunity to design and create value merchandise that sells at both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree is a big, big impact for us as we look forward. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. As for Family Dollar traffic, I would say that, as we talked about, low double-digit lifts in our H2 stores, about 2/3 of that is coming from traffic. And so we're seeing transactions develop there, and we're seeing a lot of repeat purchases coming. So part of that, as we study the marketplace, we know we're acquiring some new customers from some other folks in the marketplace. So I would tell you that part of it is both our existing customer coming back more often and then getting, acquiring new customers that may have been a Family Dollar customer and through our grand reopening initiative as we communicate back to them that we've got a new Family Dollar for you, why don't you come check it out. And they see what we have to offer and while they may have stopped shopping with us, they come back to us. So we feel real good about that pattern. \n So in the balance of the chain, we're seeing -- I think people are seeing that our store standards have been better, and they're seeing that we've been pretty aggressive with our growth in consumables, and we're working on discretionary side of the business, as Gary talked about, to move that customer over. \n We've also modified our marketing campaign to have more frequencies so that we can be in the marketplace more often, which I'm excited about because we've got a gap there before. So that will close that gap. So I would tell you that it's -- in the H2s, it's some new customers and the rest of the chain, it's both. And I think the good news is those trips are growing up. Joe, thanks for the question. This is Duncan. We've got it obviously in all H2 stores, and we're putting it in all our new stores as well. The key constraint at a store level is kind of the size first and the width, second. And we do have multiple formats of the queuing line. So I will tell you that where we can, we're putting it in because it is very profitable to the store, not only the single-serve beverages that are there. But then again, the -- that front end is quite profitable, both on the snack side as well as -- you probably noticed, we've been putting discretionary items on there. And the team right now is testing another front queuing line that will actually enhance profitability for that front end and really fit the needs of our customer I think better. So it's primarily an H2 initiative at this point is where we're focused. Where we're doing any kind of other renovations, we'll see if it can be accommodated, but it's really the H2 number. John, it's Duncan. Thanks for the question. I think it'd probably comp like a regular new store is what we're thinking about. And we've got a handful of them that have kind of cycled themselves. So we're learning quickly, but it's behaving like a new store. Edward, it's Duncan. Thanks for the question. I would say that store manager turnover has improved slightly. We're still at a level that I'm not happy with.

            "name": "Gary Philbin",
            "content": "Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. \n As we reported today, the turnaround of the Family Dollar business continues to gain momentum. Family Dollar same-store sales increase of 2.4% was the third consecutive quarter of sequential acceleration and represented a 160 basis point improvement in the 2-year stacked comp. And despite sales headwinds created by the global helium shortage, Dollar Tree segment delivered a same-store sales increase of 2.4% while cycling a strong 3.7 increase from the prior year's quarter. Dollar Tree has now delivered 46 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales and 8 consecutive quarters of 2-year stacked comps exceeding 6%. \n I'm proud of the team's accomplishments. During the quarter, we successfully consolidated our store support centers and, as planned, closed 296 Family Dollar stores as part of our store optimization efforts. Additionally, we completed 542 Family Dollar renovations into the H2 format.\n Our results for the second quarter included a sales increase of 3.9% to $5.74 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 2.4%. Our GAAP EPS of $0.76 exceeded our $0.64 to $0.73 per share guidance range. Other highlights for the quarter included completing 542 Family Dollar H2 renovations, completing $275 Dollar Tree Snack Zones, repurchasing 88.4 million of shares during the quarter as part of our share buyback program. At the end of July, we formally moved all business to the Chesapeake, Virginia campus. This represented the work over the past year to bring all functions and especially our merchant teams together. While we still have associates in the moving process, we now have one physical location to conduct our business.\n Regarding Dollar Tree's sales highlights for the second quarter. Dollar Tree had increases in both traffic and ticket with traffic slightly outpacing the ticket increase. Geographically, all regions comped positively. \n Cadence of comps through the quarter. All 3 months were better than 1.5% with June being the strongest month. Dollar Tree continued to deliver solid positive comps in the consumables category. Our discretionary business also comped positive but was impacted by the global helium shortage. We estimated that our comp was negatively impacted from lost balloon sales by approximately 40 basis points. We expect this helium shortage headwind to continue, but to a lesser degree, in the back half of the year. The first half is more impacted with the timing of our biggest balloon holidays, Valentine's Day, Mother's and Father's Day as well as school graduations. \n For real estate. In the second quarter for both segments, we opened a total of 150 new stores, 107 Dollar Trees, 43 Family Dollars. We relocated or expanded 17 Dollar Tree and 2 Family Dollar stores. We renovated 542 Family Dollar stores as part of our H2 renovation initiative, and we rebannered 106 Family Dollars to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 817 projects during the quarter. We also added freezers and coolers into 210 Dollar Tree stores during the second quarter, bringing our total of Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 5,970.\n During the quarter, we closed 305 stores, 9 Dollar Trees in consistent with our previous announced efforts to optimize our real estate portfolio of 296 Family Dollar stores. We ended the quarter with 15,115 stores, split out 7,306 Dollar Tree stores and 7,809 Family Dollars.\n Last week, we opened up our 24th U.S. distribution center located in Morrow County, Ohio, on time, on budget. The 1.2 million-square-foot facility is creating approximately 400 jobs in Central Ohio and will initially be serving Dollar Tree stores. It is equipped with the necessary system to serve both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments in the future. I would call out the partnership and support we received from the State of Ohio, Morrow County and the surrounding communities has been just outstanding. \n Before I turn the call over to Duncan to discuss the Family Dollar business, I'd like to provide you all an update on tariffs. We have been operating in unique times, to say the least, as it relates to tariffs. \n As I stated 1 quarter ago, our merchandising teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating the effects of the 25% tariffs imposed under Section 301 for Chinese goods included on Lists 1, 2 and 3. Prior to the recent USTR announcements on List 4 as well as the additional 5% tariff increase on all lists, we believe our team has successfully mitigated most of the adverse effects of the Section 301 tariffs. We've negotiated price concessions, canceled orders, modified specs, evolved product mix and diversified vendors. We are now taking actions to mitigate the recently announced tariff increases, and we'll continue to assess the future impact of those tariffs. Our merchandising team is experienced, committed and talented. They have developed a tested and proven process for mitigating costs and have the metrics in place to track and measure success. The team will continue to focus on delivering great values to our customers while managing and protecting margins. \n I'll now turn the call over to Duncan. Thank you, Kevin. \n I will share a brief update on our early reads from the Dollar Tree Plus! test. We are in the very early stages of our multi-price point test at select Dollar Tree stores, and we'll continue to closely monitor the results, including impacts to traffic, sales and margins. Some details related to the test are, launched in mid-May, by the end of June, we had the test rolled out to approximately 115 stores. The test includes newly added products at price points of $2, $3, $4 and $5. The products being tested, which currently include about 200 SKUs, are clearly identified as Dollar Tree Plus! items providing customers more choices, more sizes, more savings. We are testing a cross section of high-, moderate- and low-volume stores as well as urban, suburban and rural settings, so we can understand how customers respond in the varying markets. Early in the test, the product mix has leaned more towards consumables, and this will evolve as we move towards the holiday season with more discretionary items added to the test. We've received feedback on the values from our customers on the initial merchandise assortment, and this is critical as we know we want to protect the Dollar Tree brand. Our customers view Dollar Tree as the destination for terrific value for what you spend in $1. \n We are pleased with how our teams have started and implemented the test across varied geographies to our volumes and size. It's giving us valuable insights to how our customers view these values across a Dollar Tree store. Our teams are excited about the evolution of the merchandise assortment as we approach the holiday season. On our most recent import trip, we have bought specifically for Dollar Tree Plus! stores and I think excited about the additional assortment that will resonate with our customers as we go into our holidays.\n Finally, I wanted to share a few words regarding our field leadership meetings that I attended in the past few weeks for both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. This is the opportunity to connect with field leaders face-to-face, teach and learn, recognize, reward all those individuals and teams for performance and service awards. We interact with buyers and sellers. The merchants and our field team work together. We coach and mentor people development and ensure that we are all aligned heading into the important holiday season. We had very productive meetings, and I'm pleased with the focus on business acumen of our businessmen and women that our leading our field organizations. Our leaders are energetic, focused and motivated going into this important back half.\n Operator, we're now ready to take your questions. Yes. I'd tell you what, we're pretty excited about the 2.4% comp at Family Dollar. And what's most exciting, to your question, is all boats are rising. We're seeing a great performance in our H2 stores. But to me, what we're seeing is the bulk of the stores are also driving great comp sales. And as I talked about on my prepared remarks, we're now seeing positive traffic across the chain. So that's telling us our customers are liking what we're doing as we clean up our stores. \n As you know, we have roughly 1,000 H2 stores out there, and we closed the quarter with 7,809. So the good news here is we have multiyears to add as we're going to talk about 1,150-or-so stores this year and how do we really change the face of our chain. So I would tell you that we can't -- with that small store base, we can't run the whole comp. So we're seeing the balance of the chain really help there. We did have some help from store closures, but it was not nearly as impactful as the balance of the chain. And Simeon, this is Gary. Let me add my color to that. For both banners, I think it's important as we went into this year knowing all the stores that were going to be torn up for renovations. H2 at Family Dollar, Snack Zones at Dollar Tree. By the time we were going to get to Q2, we will touch 1,000-plus stores. And by design, not exactly reading the crystal ball as well as you would like, we went in aggressively, closeouts, our WOW product at the Dollar Tree side, a little bit more on consumable side, on the merchandise plan at Family Dollar. So part of that was to make sure we could go through touchy stores, catch them, pull them back together and still drive a positive comp.\n As far as balloons, the impact there was the impact of 40 bps. And that's really just on what we lost on balloon sales in the first half or in the second quarter year-over-year. And obviously, first half, as I called out, is a little more impactful. What we didn't measure was balloon sales usually have a halo effect of everything else in the party department, which is obviously one of our highest margin in a very large business, and it really drives customers to that store. So we know it's not going to be as impactful because the holidays aren't as big, and we'd like to think it's going to get moderately better as we go into '20, but that was probably the best way to measure the balloon impact. Yes. I'd tell you what, Matt, thanks for the question. We -- as you can see, our engine is growing. Our traffic is turning positive, and we're driving some real growth with consumables, and our job is to convert that to the discretionary side of the store to enhance our margin throughout the year. We've got a really strong back half plan and a strong holiday plan that we just shared with our leaders at the Annual Leadership Conference. \n And I think year-over-year, you're going to see us continue to strive to grow our comps as we get more H2s on the ground, they mature. And what we're seeing in the balance of the stores is they're really starting to have higher standards at store level, and they're -- so the stores are getting cleaned up. The customer is noticing. And they're getting the components of some of the H2 stores while they may not be an H2 store. So we're trying to fast adapt as we learn what are the key winners in key categories. And we did some -- a number of resets last year that are now going to start cycling and be helpful to comp in the back half. So I feel pretty good about our business plan with comps as we look forward. Yes. And Chuck, I would just give you some color. I think really, the last 2 years, our seasons have gotten out of the gates very quickly and performed very well. All this inventory we brought in to beat the tariffs is there. That's the imports. It's higher margin. As we kick off, really, the fall/harvest season as we get past Labor Day, to me, we are set up to take advantage of what the Dollar Tree does best. And that's getting geared up on the discretionary side of the business. We've invested in consumables to make sure we had the kind of traffic and customer count we needed as we went through all of our Snack Zones. Snack Zones are delivering what we brought across the network. And now let's shift gears a little bit back to what the best time of the year is for Dollar Tree. And that's really September, October on through the Christmas holiday. Thanks, Judah. Yes. Short answer. Listen, I mean we're 6 days from the last change, right? So I mean here's how we've gone through the year. The merchant teams had mitigated Lists 1, 2 and 3, as we knew it. Then when List 4A, 4B first came out, we had plans on that and, actually, on our trip to Asia felt very good about where we were on that. And then of course, the most recent changes, make that the callout of our most recent news. Well, the things we're doing are working pretty darn well. I would say the vendor community is stepping up. We have done things like we've said before. We can really work hard on changing how we're packing things or the packaging, on how many units can we get on container so we can land the overall cost lower. We've been able to move, I would say, modestly $100 million on some of the buying trips out of China with our strategy of China plus 1.\n I give credit to our merchants. This is about negotiating a vendor at a time to make those differences, and that's why I went into this call. We see the most -- we want to give you the math to give you some sense of the scale. And really, while it's work we got to do from 6 days ago, I have confidence in the group that we'll mitigate it for the balance of the year. Well, we have 1 DC that is in Utah that distributes to both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. We now have 1, 2, 3, 4 additional DCs that have the internal workings and warehouse management system that allows us to deliver to both. We've needed the capacity for the Dollar Tree banner because we have capacity in the Family Dollar network because of their closures, the rebanners. And of course, that's putting pressure on the Dollar Tree banner. So ultimately, it comes down to the size of the building. Any new building that we've done, it comes out now with the ability to deliver either banner, which will be a place that we move to. And that's a stem-mile opportunity for us in the out years. It's right now a function of capacity needed for Dollar Tree banner to make sure we can service those stores. And we pick up, obviously, some stem mile every time we open up a Dollar Tree banner because we have more stores closer to that. Thanks, John. I would say, at this point, it's purely additive to the basket. So it's telling us, I'm a Dollar Tree shopper. I come in. I like my regular items. And now here is something that surprised me is some of the feedback we hear. And that goes into the what was, \"their regular basket.\" So I think we've start off with some items that are giving us some pretty good information how our customer views it. But what I'm really maybe most excited about is putting a bit more of the Dollar Tree whimsy and surprise of the WOW effect into some of the items. And then that will give us another variant to what customers are buying and especially as we get around holiday time. So more to come. We bought specifically for these stores, and they'll be in addition to the assortment as we continue to evolve and to get the best read we can. Kelly, well, listen, we're managing to what we know, let's start there. So I think what we try to paint a picture of the magnitude for this 4A when we knew it was initially 10%, that was in our sights. And the team went to work right away on 4A knowing that 4B was coming. We had more time on 4B. Once the tariff was increased for both List 4 and List 1, 2 and 3, we just sort of continued to do the same playbook that's been working for us. So everything that I had called out before.\n So we're in the unique times, and we're in unique times where I think there is -- the opportunity is I would tell you that our vendor community is both -- wants to work through this and help, at this moment in time. And prior to this, they are also concerned they might lose business. And some have as we have found other opportunities either inside China or outside China. So there's never just one tune you play to overcome this. So what gives me confidence for the balance of this year is I can see the rocks in front of me and our teams have worked real hard to overcome what we see this year.\n Too early to comment on '20. Shoot, I'm trying to think about what might happen this week or next week. But we are working real hard on what we know today based on the USTR as we go into what's going to be the first increase on September 1 knowing that there's another one in October and then finally, December 15. Those are the ones that we know of right now. You know, we -- I can't in scale on -- of what we sell. I mean we try to bring items in. It's not a huge amount. I mean, of course, you try to bring it in if it's on the water. But keeping in mind it's 6 weeks before you leave a port and it gets somewhere else. And we're often not given 6 weeks to make much of a move. If we can do anything, we do. But it's not meaningful on the scale what we're talking about on cost of goods and the tariffs. And I would just have to call out with some of the same efforts, Dollar Tree is going to have 1 of its best 3 years ever since I've been here on store manager turnover. So I think the initiatives are well focused and pointing at the right things. And we're working real hard to get both banners to -- ought to be a banner year on store manager turnover. Well, on the timing side, listen, I think as we get and evolve the assortment, we're going to learn more. So I can't quite give you a time line. I'm more interested in what can I learn from giving our customers an evolving assortment that will tell us more what resonates with her when she's in a Dollar Tree. \n And as far as tariffs, obviously, anybody out there today who's importing is affected no matter what the price point. It obviously goes into the equation, but it does make you take a look at where you're buying it from. But to hit the mark, you have to really focus on what the customer wants, as always, in retail; and for our Dollar Tree stores, how does that play out. When we take a look at retail, that go up to $5. And I think it's -- that's really what we're focused on. What's in our -- what's our Dollar Tree customer going to look for in our world. And that's where our merchandising teams are very focused on."

            "name": "Kevin Wampler",
            "content": "Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. \n Total sales for the second quarter increased 3.9% to $5.74 billion comprised of $2.96 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.78 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.4%. And on a segment basis, same-store sales for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar increased 2.4%. \n Overall, gross profit was $1.65 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year's quarter. As a percent of sales, gross margin was 28.7% compared to 30.1% in Q2 of 2018. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 70 basis points to 33.8% when compared to the prior year quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter included merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 55 basis points primarily due to higher domestic outbound freight costs and an increase in the mix of lower-margin consumables sold; distribution costs increased approximately 10 basis points due to higher payroll costs; and occupancy costs increased approximately 5 basis points on the lower comp compared to the prior year. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 23.3% during the second quarter compared with 25.7% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to the following: markdown expense increased approximately 100 basis points resulting from store closure, rebanner and renovation markdowns, as anticipated, as part of our store optimization process; merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 95 basis points primarily due to increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise and slightly higher freight costs; and shrink increased approximately 45 basis points resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the current quarter and from changes to the accrual rate. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales in the quarter increased 80 basis points to 24% from 23.2% in the same quarter last year. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales improved to 22.5% compared to 22.6% for the second quarter of 2018. The improvement was due to the following: store operating costs were lower by approximately 15 basis points due to lower utility costs, specifically electricity resulting primarily from the benefit of the LED lighting program in the stores; payroll costs increased approximately 10 basis points primarily due to an increase in store hourly payroll due to higher average hourly rate partially offset by lower retirement plan expenses. \n SG&A expenses for the Family Dollar segment were 22.7% as a percentage of sales in the second quarter compared to 21.6% for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to the net of the following: operating and corporate expenses increased approximately 95 basis points resulting primarily from the loss of disposable and fixed assets due to the store closure write-offs; and stores' supplies expense to support the H2 initiative; payroll expenses increased approximately 35 basis points primarily due to average hourly rate increases and additional hours, including temporary health expense, to support H2 renovations; and depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 15 basis points as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated or amortized.\n Corporate and support expenses increased 30 basis points as a result of $10.8 million of store support center consolidation costs and higher depreciation. On a consolidated basis, operating income was $268.9 million compared with $382.5 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin was 4.7% of sales compared to 6.9% of sales in last year's second quarter.\n Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $40.5 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% compared to 18.9% in the prior year's second quarter. The quarter and prior year's quarter benefited by $5.8 million and $8.1 million, respectively, for a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions resulting from statute expirations. \n For the second quarter, the company had net income of $180.3 million or $0.76 per diluted share. This compared to net income of $273.9 million or $1.15 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.\n Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $623.4 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of the fiscal 2018. Our outstanding debt as of August 3, 2019, was $4.3 billion. \n During the second quarter, we invested $88.4 million in the repurchase of approximately 882,000 shares. At quarter end, we had $812 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We will provide updates on additional share repurchases, if any, following the quarter in which they occur.\n Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 15.1% from the same time last year while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 7.4%. Our inventory levels reflect the early receipt of imports to mitigate tariffs. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings, rebanners and our sales initiatives for the back half of the year. \n Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 2.3% from the same period last year and increased 3% on a selling square-foot basis. Capital expenditures were $293.3 million in the second quarter versus $213.4 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2019, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion, which is consistent with our initial 2019 outlook. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $155.1 million for the second quarter and $152.5 million in the second quarter of last year. And for fiscal 2019, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. \n Our updated outlook for fiscal 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ] includes the following assumptions. Calendar considerations for the remainder of the year includes the following: there will be 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will negatively impact Q4 sales. With regard to tariffs and the recent USTR announcements, we estimate that without mitigation, List 4A and the additional 5% tariffs on List 1, 2 and 3 would costs the company approximately $26 million in additional tariffs. Our updated outlook does not include the recently announced tariff increases as we are currently working to mitigate these costs.\n Our company outlook on March 6, 2019, included $95 million in discrete costs related to our Family Dollar store optimization initiative and our store support center consolidation. With the increased visibility of our overall costs, we now expect to incur $85 million in discrete costs for the year, of which we've incurred $76 million in the first half of the year. Our Q3 outlook includes the remaining estimated $9 million in costs related to these initiatives. \n We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wage and completing the company's initiative plans. We expect year-over-year domestic freight costs as a percentage of sales to flatten out in the second half while import freight rate, as we noted in last quarter's call, will increase in the back half of the year. Net interest expense will be approximately $41.1 million in Q3 and approximately $162.7 million for fiscal 2019.\n We cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we've not adjusted our outlook for currency rate changes. And as always, our outlook assumes no additional share repurchases. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.4% for the third quarter and 22.1% for fiscal 2019. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.5 million shares for Q3 and 237.6 million shares for the full year.\n For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.66 billion to $5.77 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.16. These estimates are based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and include approximately $9 million of discrete costs.\n For fiscal 2019, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $23.57 billion and $23.79 billion based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and approximately 1.3% square footage growth. \n The company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for full year fiscal 2019 will range between $4.90 and $5.11, which includes discrete costs of $85 million or $0.28 per share and approximately $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share in store-closure-related costs. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Gary. So as we look at the margin, as we look to the back half, obviously, the front half, in particular, was loaded with the discrete costs. As we've said, we have incurred about $76 million of what we now believe is $85 million of costs that we will incur. We look for the gross margin to become much more comparable to last year. It's obviously been down. I think the one thing that we have to always consider is we've been driving our business in the Family Dollar world with consumables. And even in Q2, the Dollar Tree business was driven by consumables based upon what everything we have going on, touching all these stores that we're touching. \n So we're driving traffic. We're getting our core customer back into the store in Family Dollar, and they're liking what they're seeing. It's a little bit more consumable-driven. So our job that we still have ahead of us is to continue to improve our discretionary business, but we do look for the gross margin on the kind of dollar side to start to level out as we go through the back half. Matt, it's Kevin. As -- within my prepared remarks, I tried to get some good color on this. So let's kind of break it down into pieces here, if we can. So obviously, within the press release, we talked about $48 million of discrete costs within the quarter as well as $15 million of store closure costs. Within that -- so that's a total of $63 million or about 230 basis points. And basically, what I did -- if you take out the $10 million of store consolidation expenses, that means about $52 million sat within the Family Dollar segment. And as we called out within the prepared remarks, about 100 -- and that's about 190 bps. And that basically broke down really about 100 bps of markdowns, which you talked about. So you're talking about all the store closures, all the renovations, all the rebanners, everything related around that from that piece. And then on the SG&A side of it, it's all of the asset write-off for all the store closures, and again, we closed 296 stores during the quarter; supplies for the H2 renovations as well as labor, temp labor for the H2 renovations as well. So that's roughly 90, 95 bps. So that's kind of how to bucketize them the best way and the big-picture way.\n As far as a go-forward margin, we have huge opportunities. Obviously, it's been a disappointing year from shrink perspective. We have a lot of opportunity as we go forward. As we talked about last quarter, look forward to start to flatten out in the back half on a comparative basis. A lot of initiatives in process there relating to: one, just changes in leadership and structure, really working on our commitment to training and our execution of policies and procedures; defensive merchandising initiatives, analytics. And again, getting our inventory levels down as well will be very, very helpful in that regard. So I think we have a huge opportunity as we go into next year to help our gross margin in that regard. And then, Chuck, in regards to your question relating to the Family Dollar margin. Again, really, 3 buckets related to the change year-over-year for the quarter. And again, it was 100 basis points from the markdowns related to the initiatives, about 95 basis points related to increased sales of lower-margin goods, as well as slightly at higher freight and then about 45 basis points related to shrink. So that's really kind of the 3 buckets as we put them in and can best describe for you.\n So I don't know if there's any -- something beyond that, that you're looking for. I think if you look at the first quarter, gross profit was roughly flat year-over-year versus this quarter. And so we were impacted more by freight in this quarter than we were the first quarter. And again, a little bit of timing, a little bit of what we've got going on. Again, we did build inventory as well during the quarter with -- from an import standpoint to mitigate tariffs. So there's some effect from that a little bit.\n But overall, as we look at it, I think the idea of freight was the bigger piece. We do look for that to mitigate a little bit as we go through the back half, as we've said. And then the other piece, as we called out, was really the idea that we did sell. We had a better consumable business in the second quarter. And so our sales mix, our margin mix averaged a little lower at the end of the day because of the overall consumable mix. As we go forward, I don't know that we -- as I've said, I don't think that we still expect to see the same type of pressure that we saw in Q2. No. We haven't updated the guidance we gave back in March on that subject. Obviously, we're just kicking off our budget season right now, as we speak, basically, for next year. And I don't think in -- simplest terms, I don't think anything in the base has changed. I think we have the unknown of tariffs and where they go and what they may do. I don't know that we -- any others have an answer for that at this point in time. We'll have to take that into consideration accordingly. But I would tell you the base case, I don't see necessarily a change in our thought process. Duncan made that comment. I mean, obviously, I think we're only 3 weeks in. So it's not like we're going to get a whole lot of other information. But I mean we're pleased is where we would state it, that we're not going to make a statement whether it's higher or lower or what it might be, but we're very pleased at this point. We said -- we've always said it's based upon GAAP EPS."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to Dollar Tree, Inc.'s First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. \n At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Guiler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for Q1 2019. Participating on today's call will be President and CEO, Gary Philbin; Family Dollar President, Duncan Mac Naughton; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler. \n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent 8-K, 10-Q and Annual Report, which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so. \n At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] \n Now I will turn the call over to Gary Philbin, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer. \nGary Philbin: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our team's efforts throughout the first quarter, as many of the initiatives we discussed in Q4 have been kicked off and are progressing nicely. \n Our Dollar Tree team delivered a solid increase in same-store sales while cycling its toughest quarterly compare from the prior year, and Family Dollar again demonstrated a sequential acceleration in comp sales. In fact, the Family Dollar segment delivered its strongest quarterly same-store sales increase since we began reporting comps for the banner. \n Results for the first quarter included a sales increase of 4.6% to $5.81 billion, consolidated same-store sales increase of 2.2%. The Dollar Tree segment delivered its 45th consecutive positive comp quarter with a 2.5% comp, and Family Dollar same-store sales delivered a positive 1.9% despite the shift of early SNAP sales into Q4 from February. \n GAAP earnings per share were $1.12. On an adjusted basis, excluding the accelerated rent expense for Family Dollar Stores scheduled to close in 2019 related to ASC 842, diluted EPS was $1.14, within $0.01 of the high-end of our guidance range. \n Other key highlights for the quarter included completing 372 Family Dollar H2 model renovations; completing 324 Dollar Tree Snack Zones; reinitiating our share buyback program, purchasing $100 million worth of shares in the quarter; and continuing to remain on track with our consolidation of store support centers, as many of our Family Dollar associates and new hires are now in the process of moving to the Chesapeake campus.\n As we outlined in the previous call, due to the costs associated with our store optimization initiatives and store support center consolidation project, year-over-year operating income is expected to be lower in the first half of fiscal 2019, but is expected to show improvement in the second half as the initiatives gain traction. The majority of our previously announced store closings are taking place in the second quarter along with the completion of our store support center consolidation. \n For Dollar Tree sales highlights in the first quarter. Dollar Tree saw nice increases in both traffic and ticket, with traffic slightly outpacing the ticket increase. Geographically, all regions comped positively. \n Cadence of comps through the quarter. April was the strongest comp month of the quarter, and March was negative. Both months were impacted by the timing shift of the Easter holiday.\n Dollar Tree continues to deliver solid positive comps in the consumables category, and our seasonal business performed very well. It remains strong, and our Dollar Tree's Easter season was one of our best sell-throughs ever.\n At Dollar Tree Canada, the team delivered mid-single-digit positive comps for the quarter with increases in both ticket and traffic. The consumable comp outperformed discretionary. Top-performing categories included Easter, seasonal, food and household products. \n Highlights in Q1 for Dollar Tree Direct are our online business. We saw increases on our in-line comp sales, items available-for-sale, site visitors and engagement. Our e-commerce team continues to do a great job of engaging with our customers through a number of avenues. Our online content is constantly evolving to reflect our changing assortment, and we are very active in promoting the Dollar Tree brand through blog posts, banner ads and social media. The team also did a great job in producing and distributing our catalogs for the Easter holiday and the upcoming summer season. \n Looking at real estate for both banners in the first quarter, we opened a total of 91 new stores, 65 Dollar Trees and 26 Family Dollar Stores. We relocated or expanded 11 stores, 6 Dollar Tree and 5 Family Dollar. We renovated 372 Family Dollar Stores as part of our H2 renovation initiative, and we re-bannered 45 former Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree for a total of 519 projects during the quarter. We also added freezers and coolers into 102 Dollar Tree stores during the first quarter, now bringing our total Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 5,766. \n During the quarter, we closed 25 stores, 9 Dollar Tree and 16 Family Dollar. And we ended with 15,264 stores, 7,102 being Dollar Trees and 8,162 being Family Dollar.\n Before I turn the call over to Duncan to discuss the Family Dollar business, I'd like to provide you an update on tariffs. \n Our merchandising teams have done a terrific job of mitigating the effects of 25% tariffs imposed under Section 301 for Chinese goods included on List 1, 2 and 3. We are uncertain as to whether or when tariffs will be applied to the List 4 products currently being considered by the U.S. Trade Representative. If tariffs on List 4 products are implemented, we expect that it will be impactful to our business and especially to consumers in general. Until we have more clarity, our outlook excludes the impact of tariffs on List 4 products. However, our outlook continues to include the impact of tariffs on List 1, 2 and 3 products. \n Our teams are doing a nice job managing the controllables and running our business. We continue to believe we are well positioned with the initiatives for both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree banners to capture the significant opportunity ahead of us. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Duncan. \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. While we are pleased with the Family Dollar's team's same-store sale increase of 1.9% for the quarter, we recognize there is much more work to be done. As we make progress on improving the consistency of execution across our store base and accelerate our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio, we see great opportunity to improve Family Dollar's productivity and performance in 2019 and beyond. We are very bullish on our progress to date and believe this will help transform our customer experience.\n Regarding Family Dollar sales highlights for the first quarter. An increase in average ticket drove the same-store sales increase in the quarter, partially offset by a decline in transaction count. Consumables performed very well, delivering its 10th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales, and the discretionary business was slightly negative. \n Regarding the cadence of comps during the quarter. February was negative, impacted by the shift of early SNAP sales into Q4. March was slightly positive, and April was the strongest month of the quarter, benefiting from the later Easter in 2019. \n 7 of our 8 lines of businesses comped positive for the quarter. From a regional perspective, 6 of our 7 zones comped positive, with the strongest performance in the Northeast, the West and the Southeast zones. \n As evidenced by our improved sales performance, our acceleration of initiatives to optimize the Family Dollar real estate portfolio is delivering results. We are seeing meaningful improvement in operational performance across the footprint of renovated Family Dollar Stores, resulting in increased traffic and low double-digit comp sales lifts. \n We are pleased with the results of our H2 renovation program, both with traffic and the diversity of our locations. Comps are being driven 2/3 by traffic and 1/3 by average ticket. Customer feedback has included the following. Customers indicate they're shopping more often and spending more for the improved assortment. Broader selection of $1 items, more frozen and refrigerated product and cleaner stores. Our survey feedback indicates H2 shoppers have a better overall shopping experience. More than half of the H2 stores -- shoppers indicate they'll come back and spend more. In May, we closed 140 stores, and we'll close another 150 by the end of July. We're making progress on our previously announced plans. \n Given the results we're seeing from our store optimization initiative, we're confident it will allow us to drive substantial improvement in the quality and performance of the Family Dollar portfolio and create long-term value. \n We're also in the process of consolidating our store support center. This is -- this project will be completed over the next few months and provide us great opportunity as an organization. We will benefit from the stability it provides and from the enhanced communication, collaboration and teamwork to provide our store teams with greater support.\n I will now turn the call to Kevin to provide more detail on our first quarter performance and our updated outlook for 2019. \nKevin Wampler: Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Total sales for the first quarter increased 4.6% to $5.81 billion comprised of $2.96 billion of Dollar Tree and $2.85 billion of Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.2%. On a segment basis, same-store sales for the Dollar Tree segment increased 2.5% or 2.4% when adjusted for Canadian currency, and the Family Dollar comp increased 1.9%. \n Overall, gross profit increased 1.6% to $1.73 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year's quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross margin decreased to 29.7% compared to 30.6% in Q1 of 2018. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was flat at 34.5% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter included higher distribution, depreciation and payroll costs, increased freight costs, primarily outbound freight, as well as a higher proportion of sales in the lower-margin consumable category. These increases were offset by improved shrink and improved initial merchandise markdown. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 24.8% during the first quarter compared with 26.7% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to the following: merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 90 basis points, primarily due to increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise, higher domestic freight costs and inventory markdowns for stores being closed and re-bannered in Q1. \n Shrink increased approximately 50 basis points, resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the current year and an increase in the accrual rate. Distribution costs increased approximately 35 basis points, resulting primarily from higher merchandising and distribution payroll-related costs. Occupancy costs increased approximately 20 basis points, resulting from the $6.7 million of accelerated amortization of the right-of-use assets for Family Dollar Stores we plan to close during 2019. Excluding these costs, occupancy costs would have delevered slightly as a percent of sales. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter increased 40 basis points to 23.1% from 22.7% in the same quarter last year. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales increased to 21.3% compared to 21.1% for the first quarter of 2018. The increase was due to the following: payroll costs increased approximately 20 basis points, primarily due to an increase in store hourly payroll due to an increased average hourly rate, support of company initiatives and an increase in incentive compensation resulting from prior year adjustments due to lower performance of target. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in retirement plan expense. \n Operating and corporate expense increased approximately 5 basis points resulting from higher debit and credit fees, primarily due to increased card penetration. Store operating costs decreased approximately 5 basis points due to lower utility costs, specifically electricity, resulting primarily from the benefit of the LED lighting program in the stores. \n Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Family Dollar segment was 21.6% as a percentage of sales in the first quarter compared to 21.5% for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to the net of the following: payroll expenses increased approximately 25 basis points, primarily due to an increased store hourly payroll -- increased average hourly rate and a support of the company's initiatives related to the costs per store renovations, re-banners and closures. \n Store operating costs increased approximately 10 basis points, due primarily to higher refrigeration repairs and maintenance costs in the current quarter. And depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 25 basis points as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated or amortized.\n Corporate and support expenses increased 20 basis points as a result of $7.6 million of store support center consolidation costs and higher legal fees. On a consolidated basis, operating income was $385.5 million compared with $437.6 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 6.6% compared to 7.9% in the last -- in last year's first quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 20 basis points to 13.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Operating income margin for the Family Dollar segment was 3.2% for the quarter.\n Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $41.6 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.1% compared to 22.6% in the prior year's first quarter. \n For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, the company had net income of $267.9 million or $1.12 per diluted share compared to net income of $160.5 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. This year's first quarter included $6.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share of accelerated rent expense related to the adoption of ASC 842 for lease accounting that was not included in our previous company outlook. Adjusted EPS was $1.14. The prior year's quarter included $0.52 of costs associated with debt refinancing. Today's press release includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures for details on these adjustments. \n Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $725.8 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Our outstanding debt as of May 4, 2019 was approximately $4.3 billion. \n During the first quarter, we invested $100 million in the repurchase of approximately 960,000 shares of stock. At quarter end, we had $900 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We will provide updates on additional share repurchases, if any, following the quarter in which they may occur.\n Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 10.6% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 5.7%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 4.6%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings, re-banners and our sales initiatives for the second quarter. \n Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 3.8% from the same period last year and increased 3% on a selling square-foot basis. \n Capital expenditures were $209.2 million in the first quarter versus $180.9 million in the first quarter of last year. For fiscal 2019, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion, consistent with our initial 2019 outlook. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $151.2 million for the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $151.5 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2019, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $635 million to $645 million.\n Our updated outlook for fiscal 2019 includes the following assumptions: calendar considerations for the remainder of the year include that there will be 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will negatively impact Q4 sales. Our guidance includes the expectation that Section 301 tariffs will be 25% on List 1, 2 and 3 goods. However, our guidance does not include potential tariffs on List 4 goods. \n Our company outlook on March 6, 2019 included $95 million in discrete costs related to our Family Dollar store optimization initiative and our store support center consolidation. With the increased visibility of our cadence of projects, we now expect to incur approximately 90% of these costs in the first half of the year. In Q1, we incurred approximately $28 million for these initiatives. Our Q2 outlook includes an estimated $57 million in costs related to these initiatives. As noted with our company outlook on March 6, we did not include charges for lease obligation and related expenses for any closed doors in 2019 as we could not estimate the P&L impact until after the adoption of ASC 842, the new lease accounting standard. We now expect to incur approximately $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share of costs in Q2 related to store closings for lease obligations and related costs.\n We entered into new import freight contracts effective May 1 based on negotiations in April. The new contracts were unfavorable compared to our prior outlook and will add approximately $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share of expense in the back half of the year that was not included in our original company outlook for fiscal 2019 provided on March 6.\n We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wages and completing the company's initiatives plans. We expect year-over-year domestic freight costs as a percentage of sales to increase in the first half of the year and then flatten out in the second half. Net interest expense will be approximately $40.5 million in Q2 and approximately $161.8 million for fiscal 2019. \n We cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we've not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases for the year. Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 22.6% for the second quarter and 22.4% for fiscal 2019. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 238.6 million shares for Q2 and 238.8 million shares for the full year. \n For the second quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.66 billion to $5.76 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.64 to $0.73. These estimates are based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and includes approximately $57 million of discrete costs. Additionally, as I've noted, our outlook now includes approximately $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share of costs related to Q2 store closures for lease obligations and related costs that was not included in the company's previous outlook. \n For fiscal 2019, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $23.51 billion and $23.83 billion based on a low-single-digit same-store sales increase of approximately 1% of selling square footage growth. The company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for full year fiscal 2019 will range between $4.77 and $5.07. This includes discrete costs of $95 million or $0.31 per share, as previously disclosed. Additionally, our outlook now includes $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share in store closure related costs and import freight costs of $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to increased import freight rates, as previously described in our updated outlook. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Gary. \nGary Philbin: Thanks, Kevin. Before turning the call to your questions, I'd like to share some information about our Dollar Tree Plus! test. \n As announced last quarter, we are conducting a test by lifting the dollar price point restriction. Testing is not new to us, and we've got a long track record of using an analytical approach to challenge our own thinking. It's the kind of approach and process that led to the development of our H2 stores in Family Dollar and gave us the confidence to accelerate our store optimization program across the Family Dollar portfolio. \n We spent the past several months laying the groundwork for this test, carefully and thoughtfully designing a test that we believe will allow us to measure the impact of different price points, items and categories on shopping behavior, store profitability and our loyal customers' affinity for the Dollar Tree brand. We'll be leveraging Family Dollar and Dollar Tree distribution center systems and combined merchandise to efficiently get the new products into Dollar Tree stores without disrupting our normal operations. \n For the test, we have selected sales stores located in urban, suburban and rural markets, and we will be measuring the performance versus prior results as well as against our control stores in similar markets. As part of the planning for the test, our Dollar Tree team has been working closely with the Family Dollar merchants to identify the right products to include. We'll be offering a range of items across a number of categories. We will be testing primarily at price points of $3, $4 and $5, and the products will be displayed in 4-foot sections or end caps clearly branded as Dollar Tree Plus! in order to minimize confusion with our dollar values that our customers have come to expect. \n We believe the wow factor of what we have created at Dollar Tree should carry over to this test and continue to build our brand. This is not raising items from our dollar price point to a higher retail, this is about adding new items and categories to add sales and margin. \n The test officially launched a few weeks ago with products hitting the shelves of the first batch of stores. We are in the process of rolling it out to more than 100 test stores, and we'll measure, analyze and adjust products, layout and other variables to ensure we are responding to customer feedback in our continued merchandising efforts. Because it's an iterative process, we now have a set time frame for the test. It's in the early days right now, but we will have more details to share on our progress in the future. \n Lastly, my thanks to all of our store teams that are engaged daily to deliver great service and value to our customers, and a call-out to all of our family Dollar Tree members that are in the process of moving while we consolidate campuses or are staying on to train as necessary. I'm proud of everyone's efforts and achievements during this first quarter. \n Now we're ready to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n We'll take our first question from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nRobert Ohmes: My question is actually on the H2 format. And I guess maybe Gary and maybe Duncan should answer this, but just could you guys talk through -- so you've put party freezer and cooler in there. You're getting a 10-point comp lift. How far could you go with the Dollar Tree assortment over time would be one question. Another question is, can you tell us how, bringing that assortment into the H2 format, changes the store level operating dynamics? Does it change the payroll structure significantly? What does sort of the expected EBIT margin look like for a Family Dollar store that's in the H2 format? \nGary Philbin: So Robby, I'll start and hand it over to Duncan. From the standpoint of what H2 has done, it's put in some key dollar sections throughout the store. And the opportunity there is just to leverage what we've done at Dollar Tree for years, and it gives our customer the opportunity to see these great values. \n Obviously, we've added more frozen food doors that drives traffic, but as you've pointed out, we've also expanded seasonal party. We have a queuing line that sort of gives our customer the last chance to find great values. \n Let me turn it to Duncan on what we see as part of the opportunity to keep driving sales. We're pretty proud of a 10 comp in this fleet of stores, and we're going to continue to drive some additional efforts to see how high it can go. But Duncan? \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: Yes. Thanks, Gary. Thank you, Robby, for your question. As Gary stated, we're pretty excited about the success we've had to date. It's very exciting to see customers as well as our team members when you walk these stores. It's not uncommon to get hugs and thanks from both customers and store people because the people really enjoy the store environment. So we're very excited about it. \n Just one other thing I've noticed that we did fix the adjacencies of these stores to make our shopping experience much easier and thoughtful for our customer. And as we added the freezer and cooler doors with primarily food and dairy, we also added 6 doors of immediate-consumption products, which drive good gross margin for our business. Really in there is the soft drinks, the teas, the waters, the flavored energy drinks that are so popular amongst our customer. And more appropriately, we also added adult beverages, which drives foot traffic for our primary customer. So we're very excited about that. \n We do have 21 sections across the store with the Dollar Tree items in the store. And a number of things it does is it creates a halo of strong price impression for our customers, and we get feedback that says it looks like prices are lower. And we're getting great engagement from our customer in those sections, but the real magic there is that the categories are actually starting to rise. It's not just the dollar sections alone, but we get better penetration in some categories that we have seen in our traditional format. So I'm very excited about that. \n We provide additional labor when we reset these stores just because of the workload. And then we want to make sure that we don't -- we test how high is high with this. So we do invest additional labor, but then we wean the store back off and let it self-fund. Within about 4 weeks, it can get on a self-funding basis. We train one specific person in the store to handle the Dollar Tree items as they are different and they behave differently than our Family Dollar products. They're not planogrammed. They are -- we show them a section flow. So the work is relatively easy and also allows us to get in and get out of these categories pretty quickly without disappointing a customer.\n And so I would tell you that we're very bullish on what we're seeing today, both from the store teams, the labor and how it balances right back to the stores pretty quickly and the customer interaction. \nRobert Ohmes: So if I dream the dream, is the more -- these are smaller stores, but the more Dollar Tree assortment you get into an H2 Family Dollar, does the EBIT margin of that store start to look more and more like a Dollar Tree store EBIT margin? \nKevin Wampler: Robby, this is Kevin. I think as we think about it, obviously, we're working to drive top line, first and foremost, right, because that helps leverage all of our fixed costs at the end of the day. \n We've got a limited number of stores we've completed this time. Still a lot of work going on. The freezers and the coolers, adult beverage tend to drive a little bit lower margin at the end of the day. So we have to offset that with the party and the things like that. So it's a little bit too early, given the small number of stores in general. But I think in general, obviously, we're looking for an EBITDA lift. I don't think that the model is built such that we'll ever have EBITDA of a Dollar Tree store. Just given the amount of consumables we sell to our core customer for our Family Dollar banners versus discretionary business we've had in our Dollar Tree business, they will never -- they are never going to quite equate at the end of the day. But the idea, obviously, is to drive sales and drive improvement in that overall EBITDA margin as we go forward. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n We'll go next to Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nBradley Thomas: I also wanted to follow up on the H2 performance. Really encouraging. I guess, when you look at Family Dollar here for this quarter, could you talk a little bit about how much of the comp lift you're seeing was explicitly from some of the initiatives that you have in place versus maybe just the cadence of the overall consumer? And as you're looking out through the balance of the year, do you still believe these initiatives are going to be a 1.5% tailwind to comps for Family Dollar? Or is there reason to perhaps get a little bit more optimistic at this point? \nGary Philbin: Brad, thanks for your question. We're excited about what we're seeing really across the portfolio. I will tell you that this is just not H2-driven, this is really watching the entire performance of the company going up. And that was demonstrated by 7 out of 8 of our lines of businesses, positive comp in 6 of our 7 zones. So we're seeing a nice balance across the chain. \n H2 obviously is a highlight amongst where we're investing those dollars when we get that nice lift. And we believe that is a sustainable lift as we start to continue to roll this across the United States and most of our store base over time. \n I will tell you that we've had great balance across our promotional sales, our baseline sales. And then when we're preparing to close some of these stores, we're seeing some good clearance sales. So we're getting a real nice, balanced approach. So we feel good about that. And the key here is the base business is solid. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: If we back out the $0.15 of incremental, one-time item from your guidance, the midpoint's going up $0.02, but the high-end of the range is coming down quite significantly. Why is that? \nKevin Wampler: Well, I think if you look at the guidance, Michael, from where we started out for the year, basically, if you take the fact that on a GAAP basis for the quarter, you would have to reduce the high-end by $0.03, and you'd basically bring up the low-end by, I believe, it was $0.08. And -- so you have at adjustment. \n And then beyond that, it's just the range always narrows as you go further down the end of the quarter, a quarter further into the year. We now have 3 quarters left, so we have roughly $0.40 range when we first started the year. We're now down to a $0.30 range. But then, otherwise, to your point, it's just -- it's the initiatives, the 2 new items that we've brought in. So I don't think there's anything to read into it other than that. From my perspective, we didn't -- the only changes to the guidance were for the lease obligation costs that we brought in. Again, as we noted, we couldn't give you those at the beginning of the year, given the fact that we had to adopt and implement ASC 842 before we could even calculate those costs. And then obviously, the new item with the new contracts on our import freight. \nMichael Lasser: And Kevin, should we still be expecting 14% to 18% EPS growth into next year? And what number should we be basing that growth off of? Should we be excluding the incremental $0.15 hit from those items that you mentioned? \nKevin Wampler: No, Michael, I think as a backdrop of our outlook in March, we wanted to give a little longer-term outlook, given the significant investment we were making in this year in particular around the initiatives to drive improved performance in our Family Dollar Stores. And we're obviously very focused on all of our store initiatives and the projects. And as Gary and Duncan have described, we're making really good progress, and we like where we're going there. So that's very, very positive. \n Given another point in time, I think -- I don't think we've changed necessarily our viewpoint. We've said at that point in time that it was based upon the GAAP number. We haven't really updated anything at this point, so I think it's -- I don't think anything's changed and we'll just continue to update you probably later in the year as we continue to work forward through this year and we have more data to work with. \nGary Philbin: And Michael, from -- it's Gary. From my perspective, as we go through this year, with the initiatives we've called out, we're closing almost 400 Family Dollar Stores, a big investment in the H2s will go a long way first half, second half as we build momentum at Family Dollar. \n For Dollar Tree, I'm pretty proud of what the team's accomplished with this quarter in overcoming the 25% tariffs, and we see ourselves chugging along here with the season still responding the way we like to see them come through with great sell-throughs. And our customers are responding, and we're set up in a nice way for the summer season after having some good spring sales on Mother's Day and Easter. So those 2 things together, I think as we go through the back half of the year, we'll see the momentum in the second half. \nMichael Lasser: And can I just clarify one thing? We recognize that you didn't include the final list of tariffs in your guidance, given all the uncertainty there, but can you help us understand the exposure? What percent of Dollar Tree's cost of goods come from China and would be at risk if the full list of tariffs go through? \nGary Philbin: Well, here's how I think about it, Michael. If I had sat down last September and tried to take you through our exposure on those 3, I would have been wrong because our team mitigated most of it -- all of it as we went through our buying trips. And that's the approach we're taking on this List 4. Listen, I don't know when, how big, how much, what items are going to be excluded. We all know what hasn't been detailed out there. All I know is our team is doing the same process, running the same play. How do we mitigate? And that's everything from what we buy, how we buy it, where we buy it, how we ship it. We're going to use all those chapters in our playbook to get to the right answer on it. So -- listen, as it comes to pass or not, we'll keep the group updated, but we are not sitting back on this one. We're also figuring out how we mitigate it if it comes to pass. \nOperator: We'll go next to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. \nPeter Keith: So just a follow-up on Michael's question. With the current tariff exposure of List 3, you guys did a really nice job of mitigating that impact. If there was broader exposure to the rest of the Dollar Tree business, are there differences with some of the other categories that may receive new tariff exposure that would limit your mitigation? Or is it sort of  a similar approach that you would use for the whole store? \nGary Philbin: Well, I think the way I -- obviously, it's -- we import both banners. Not all of it comes from China. The vast majority does, of course. And so the things that we even did back on our January trip, we moved $100 million of seasonal buy out of China. We changed some of the specs that we were shipping items in just so we could pack more in a case, more cases on containers, so you could land it overcoming the tariff. We're looking at other countries. \n The process will be the same. I mean, our merchants now have a pretty good -- I wouldn't wish this on us, but this made our merchants go and take a look at everything we're doing in terms of speccing product, where we're buying it from, negotiating, getting costs in our product. And those are going to be the foundational elements as we go forward into this next round. \nPeter Keith: Okay, that's helpful feedback. And maybe I want to pivot to the gross margins at Family Dollar specifically digging into the shrink headwind. So the shrink headwind has just continued to intensify over the last year. I guess looking at it on a 2-year stack basis, it's now an 80 basis point headwind. Could you give us your view and when we might begin to see shrink stabilize? And what are the steps you're taking in order to minimize that hit? \nKevin Wampler: Yes. This is Kevin. I'll give you some background on that. Obviously, we're very disappointed in our results, and we own that. And we have not executed at the level we've expected to. So -- and this is, I would tell you, this is not sitting in the corner of somebody's desk, this is front and center for everybody, the operations team, the loss prevention team, the logistics team, management. \n I think one of the things we have fought a little bit is our inventory levels. Again, our inventory levels have grown. If you saw for the first time this quarter, we're actually able to bring inventory levels down, and that's going to be a continued effort there by Duncan and team as we look at that. We've made changes in the reporting structure and leadership in regards to over -- looking at the Family Dollar banners with regards to loss prevention team and how we're looking at that. We have put in place several new programs. We're putting in a new analytics software. So we're doing a lot of things. And again, as you know, what we're working on now probably takes a little bit of time to see the benefits of, but my expectation is we see the effect of the negativity dissipate somewhat as we get towards the back half. \n Now we still have work to do. I think it's a disappointing trend, but I think there is a lot of work going on to really address this on an overall basis. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. \nScott Mushkin: I just wanted to get back to the profit dollars on the H2. It wasn't clear. Are EBITDA -- sorry, EBIT dollars up in those stores? Or are they flat? Or are they down, for the ones you've converted? \nKevin Wampler: No, they're absolutely up. \nScott Mushkin: They're up? Okay, great. And then looking -- I just want to poke a little bit more at this gross margin on Family Dollar. Where do you think we've gone? Obviously, they've come down a lot. Shrink's part of it. So number one is, is that shrink really just thieving? How should -- what's the #1 cause of that shrink? And number two, as we bounce Family Dollar gross margins, any thought where we can come back up to? \nKevin Wampler: I think as we look at our gross margin Family Dollar, you kind of have to look at it in buckets is kind of the way I would think about it. So if we look at the -- overall, if we look at just the product margin, including freight, obviously, freight was a big headwind last year. A little bit of a headwind this year in the first half. We expect that to flatten out in the back half. \n As we look at actual merchandise costs, a little bit of pressure, obviously, from selling more lower margin in consumable goods, a lot of work going on to really energize the discretionary business to help offset that, so that as we see that discretionary business continue to improve, I think we have the ability to offset that as we go forward. \n I think, obviously, markdowns this year will be a very tough year of markdowns because obviously we have all the initiative markdowns going into the P&L. I think occupancy cost was actually a good point here in Q1. As I noted, excluding the $6.7 million related to the adoption of ASC 842, we actually would have shown a slight deleveraging of occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. So those things are positive. \n So I think we'll still see pressure as we go through this year in particular because of some of the one-time costs and some of the initiatives things going on. I think as we get sales -- continue to see sales improve, that helps leverage some of these things and gets us back on track to improving it back to where we would like to see it. \nGary Philbin: Scott, this is Gary. Let me just give you my color on it because the way I think about it, the things around our logistics costs, the shortage of truck drivers was an impact this year. That will level out in the back half. The DCs, we've -- listen, we've paid up more just to get people to work in distribution centers, but our productivity over time will catch that up and surpass it. \n Shrink, we have everybody on a red alert. This is -- that's controllable. And where does it come from? Well, as any good retailer, you look inside and outside, but we're just going to be smarter on responding to it more quickly. And Duncan and team are working a lot to get our folks trained. \n But the margin piece, here's still the opportunity that I think we -- besides what we're doing at H2, we still are working real hard on private brands. We have a pretty good base level penetration, but it's going to grow more over time. And the import piece, if -- what we've continued to work on, the Chinese tariffs, it's shining even a brighter light on the opportunities there, and not just the fact that we're buying some items in China. But when we get a chance to move something from a domestic to FOB China to finding the folks that actually make it all enhances the margin there. We've still got runway there, and that's the upside opportunity at Family Dollar on the margin side. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. \nScot Ciccarelli: A question on the Dollar Tree Plus!. Really 2 questions. First, philosophically, why are you not testing $2, but focusing on $3 and $5? Just trying to understand that. And then number two, how much of the store or SKU base will be, let's call it, repriced as you run through that test? \nGary Philbin: Well, a couple of important points, Scot. I mean, you may see some $2 in there. I think the point I was trying to make is we're going to see full price points. You're not going to see $3.25. You're not going to see $4.65. I think our customer, we're going to make this very easy for her to figure out as we go through it. \n And I just want to emphasize, we're not raising retails on the dollar items that our folks have come to love and count on. And I've gotten more letters from schoolteachers that are threatening me in a nice way that I don't dare do that. But I think our opportunity here is to find some additional categories, items that can add to the sales, and that's really the intent of this. It's does our customer understand the wow factor that we've worked so hard on all these years to make Dollar Tree a breakthrough brand in America? And can we take that wow factor and put it into the store and make our customers understand it and they understand the wow as we lift the dollar price point. \n So I think it's going to be very clear to the customer what these items are. They'll see the items with a sticker on them or prepriced in some fashion. That will be very clear to them. And our folks are being trained to answer all those questions. It's -- we want our customers, when they raise their hand and say, \"How much is this?\" it's not going to be because they're confused on the price, it's going to be because they still see these incredible values. \n So we're all over this in terms of getting good execution first during rollout, what do we learn as we do that, and then following up with customer feedback as we go through the process. \nScot Ciccarelli: Yes. The full price point certainly make sense. How much of the store's SKU base will be, let's call it, changed? \nGary Philbin: Well, I mentioned you're going to see, let's just say, 100-plus SKUs. And listen, in the same way we do at Dollar Tree today, you're going to see items come and go while you see it. It's not always going to be there. \n And so when you think about the SKU base, we're going to start someplace and probably end up skating somewhere else, but that's about where we're going to start and just learn as we go. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n We'll go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: Appreciate all the color on updated outlook and margins, but I wanted to just follow up and just maybe get a little bit more detail on specific expectations for 2Q versus the second half on some of those key items like freight and shrink payroll. If you can just give us a little bit more detail on how we should think about the cadence. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. I mean, I think freight, we've been fairly transparent on it in the sense of, from a domestic standpoint, we've said it's a headwind in the first half of the year. I believe it becomes basically flat in the second half. \n We've seen just some -- from an overall perspective, inbound has started to regulate itself a little bit. It seems like domestic's still running a little high. And then, obviously, we gave you the news on the import. I think that's about $0.05, but it's back half related if you think about that. \n Payroll in general, again, store hourly payroll is going to continue to basically be up slightly as we go through the year, probably no different than what we saw in Q1. We continue to see, from an employment standpoint, an increase in average hourly rate in our stores. And I think that's part of it. So we have that. And then I think from a shrink perspective, as I said, I think it's likely to continue to be up in Q2. My view is we need to see that start to level out as we get to the second half. \n I think as -- the other thing to remind everybody is initially, when we were talking about the costs related to the initiatives at the beginning of the year, we said about 75% of those costs would be incurred in the first half of the year. We're now, today, we said roughly 90% of those costs would be incurred in the first half. So based upon the fact that we can -- we've seen the cadence and the efficiency we've gained there and how our projects are laying out for the year, we've been able to see that. And obviously, it gives us that foundational base of the $57 million of costs that we're going to see in Q2 related to all those initiatives. And those touch many, many lines. It touches labor. It touches markdowns. It touches various other costs as well. So those are all kind of blended in there at the end of the day, Paul. \nPaul Trussell: Got it. And then bigger picture, as we think about the fact you are doing a lot of remodels, closing a number of Family Dollar Stores, just wanted to take a step back and get your current outlook on the opportunity still for new door growth in the dollar store industry. Maybe speak to new store productivity that you're seeing today and just where the white space is. \nGary Philbin: Paul, this is Gary. So we had said a few years ago, 25,000 domestic U.S. and 1,000 in Canada. I think on the U.S. side, I'd still see that opportunity, is going to be both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And I think as we've learned about the business, the opportunity to build Family Dollars, we were probably 60-40, even closer to 70-30 urban versus rural over time. I see that switching. I see our greenfield for Family Dollar being more rural than urban. I don't know if they'll switch to a percentage of 70-30, but probably closer to something like that over time. \n And I think the opportunity is sort of what we've called out. What we deliver is a great box shopping environment, items that people need, that as independent drugstores, grocery stores or other retailers are failing, it gives us an opportunity to grow for really both banners. But at Family Dollar, that's an opportunity in rural America. \n I think Dollar Tree continues to be one of the great brands in America. It cuts through the clutter. We still see the same opportunity across a broad middle of -- we can go anywhere, but Family Dollar probably works best inside the beltway and in the extreme rural. And for Dollar Tree, we still see plenty of opportunities. \n I think you make a good point. We're spending a lot of time and energy on the 1,000 renovations this year on H2. We've got 1,000 -- we're obviously talking about Snack Zones, but we're touching 1,000 Dollar Trees as well. But the opportunity to build more doors is there. It's going to switch more to that in the out years. \n When you take a look at the number of stores we'll have touched on H2 renovations this year, 1,000, the new stores behind us. By the time we get through end of next year, we're going to be closing in -- somewhere close to 40% of our Family Dollar fleet having been touched through our renovation or being new in the last 4 years or so. So it's going to be a change from what our customers have seen in the past. So we're bullish on what H2 can do for us, where it can operate, where we can grow it. And for Dollar Tree, we continue to be, as always, selective on the right sites for a Dollar Tree. But it's still a growth story for both banners as we look forward. \nOperator: We'll take our final question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: So either for Gary or Duncan. When you guys think about the Family Dollar's organization -- the organization's capacity, right, for change, and particularly on the real estate side, as you think about the 1,000 renovations, is that sort of the max? Can the platform handle more than that? And then the success of that, does that -- when you think about the bell curve on store performance, once you close the stores you're going to close this year, we're basically through now because of the H2's promise, another round of closings next year or beyond. \nDuncan C. Mac Naughton: John, it's Duncan. Thanks for the question. I will tell you that the Dollar Tree enterprise team, actually based here in Chesapeake, really runs and leads all the store development work across the country for both of the banners. And it's supported locally, obviously, with the folks that are in the field, a mixture of both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar people. But I will tell you that we are -- nowhere near our capacity here,  we're -- as you know, we're also adding freezers and coolers across the chain. We're adding 1,000 licenses and beverages at Family Dollar. We're doing the 1,000 Snack Zones that Gary talked about. We'll add 200 stores -- new stores at Family Dollar, 350 at Dollar Tree. I think as we get more stores on the ground in H2, we also are getting much more efficient on how to handle this, both with our teams as well as our suppliers to make these things go faster. \n I will tell you, and looking forward, I know that we will typically close 70 to 80 stores a year just based on normal store closures and maintenance of where the store performs. \nGary Philbin: And John, it's Gary. Just from the standpoint of the store closures, we took a look at what needed to close outside of lease term. And that's what we're doing in the second quarter this year. As always, we take a look at end of lease term for our fleet of stores to figure out how do we optimize where they're headed for, and actually reach out for our landlords to get input and contributions from them to now help us reinvigorate some of their properties on H2 as we go forward. \n So we'll be doing more of that, but as we go forward, second quarter is going to be where we particularly hit on the stores closing out a lease as we go through the out years either at 75 to 100, depending on the number of stores coming up on any quarter is probably closer to where we'll end up. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Randy Guiler for any additional or closing remarks. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Aaron. Thank you for joining us for today's call and especially your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss Q2 results is tentatively scheduled for Thursday August 29, 2019. Have a good day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Duncan C. Mac Naughton",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. While we are pleased with the Family Dollar's team's same-store sale increase of 1.9% for the quarter, we recognize there is much more work to be done. As we make progress on improving the consistency of execution across our store base and accelerate our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio, we see great opportunity to improve Family Dollar's productivity and performance in 2019 and beyond. We are very bullish on our progress to date and believe this will help transform our customer experience.\n Regarding Family Dollar sales highlights for the first quarter. An increase in average ticket drove the same-store sales increase in the quarter, partially offset by a decline in transaction count. Consumables performed very well, delivering its 10th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales, and the discretionary business was slightly negative. \n Regarding the cadence of comps during the quarter. February was negative, impacted by the shift of early SNAP sales into Q4. March was slightly positive, and April was the strongest month of the quarter, benefiting from the later Easter in 2019. \n 7 of our 8 lines of businesses comped positive for the quarter. From a regional perspective, 6 of our 7 zones comped positive, with the strongest performance in the Northeast, the West and the Southeast zones. \n As evidenced by our improved sales performance, our acceleration of initiatives to optimize the Family Dollar real estate portfolio is delivering results. We are seeing meaningful improvement in operational performance across the footprint of renovated Family Dollar Stores, resulting in increased traffic and low double-digit comp sales lifts. \n We are pleased with the results of our H2 renovation program, both with traffic and the diversity of our locations. Comps are being driven 2/3 by traffic and 1/3 by average ticket. Customer feedback has included the following. Customers indicate they're shopping more often and spending more for the improved assortment. Broader selection of $1 items, more frozen and refrigerated product and cleaner stores. Our survey feedback indicates H2 shoppers have a better overall shopping experience. More than half of the H2 stores -- shoppers indicate they'll come back and spend more. In May, we closed 140 stores, and we'll close another 150 by the end of July. We're making progress on our previously announced plans. \n Given the results we're seeing from our store optimization initiative, we're confident it will allow us to drive substantial improvement in the quality and performance of the Family Dollar portfolio and create long-term value. \n We're also in the process of consolidating our store support center. This is -- this project will be completed over the next few months and provide us great opportunity as an organization. We will benefit from the stability it provides and from the enhanced communication, collaboration and teamwork to provide our store teams with greater support.\n I will now turn the call to Kevin to provide more detail on our first quarter performance and our updated outlook for 2019. Yes. Thanks, Gary. Thank you, Robby, for your question. As Gary stated, we're pretty excited about the success we've had to date. It's very exciting to see customers as well as our team members when you walk these stores. It's not uncommon to get hugs and thanks from both customers and store people because the people really enjoy the store environment. So we're very excited about it. \n Just one other thing I've noticed that we did fix the adjacencies of these stores to make our shopping experience much easier and thoughtful for our customer. And as we added the freezer and cooler doors with primarily food and dairy, we also added 6 doors of immediate-consumption products, which drive good gross margin for our business. Really in there is the soft drinks, the teas, the waters, the flavored energy drinks that are so popular amongst our customer. And more appropriately, we also added adult beverages, which drives foot traffic for our primary customer. So we're very excited about that. \n We do have 21 sections across the store with the Dollar Tree items in the store. And a number of things it does is it creates a halo of strong price impression for our customers, and we get feedback that says it looks like prices are lower. And we're getting great engagement from our customer in those sections, but the real magic there is that the categories are actually starting to rise. It's not just the dollar sections alone, but we get better penetration in some categories that we have seen in our traditional format. So I'm very excited about that. \n We provide additional labor when we reset these stores just because of the workload. And then we want to make sure that we don't -- we test how high is high with this. So we do invest additional labor, but then we wean the store back off and let it self-fund. Within about 4 weeks, it can get on a self-funding basis. We train one specific person in the store to handle the Dollar Tree items as they are different and they behave differently than our Family Dollar products. They're not planogrammed. They are -- we show them a section flow. So the work is relatively easy and also allows us to get in and get out of these categories pretty quickly without disappointing a customer.\n And so I would tell you that we're very bullish on what we're seeing today, both from the store teams, the labor and how it balances right back to the stores pretty quickly and the customer interaction. John, it's Duncan. Thanks for the question. I will tell you that the Dollar Tree enterprise team, actually based here in Chesapeake, really runs and leads all the store development work across the country for both of the banners. And it's supported locally, obviously, with the folks that are in the field, a mixture of both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar people. But I will tell you that we are -- nowhere near our capacity here,  we're -- as you know, we're also adding freezers and coolers across the chain. We're adding 1,000 licenses and beverages at Family Dollar. We're doing the 1,000 Snack Zones that Gary talked about. We'll add 200 stores -- new stores at Family Dollar, 350 at Dollar Tree. I think as we get more stores on the ground in H2, we also are getting much more efficient on how to handle this, both with our teams as well as our suppliers to make these things go faster. \n I will tell you, and looking forward, I know that we will typically close 70 to 80 stores a year just based on normal store closures and maintenance of where the store performs."

            "name": "Gary Philbin",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our team's efforts throughout the first quarter, as many of the initiatives we discussed in Q4 have been kicked off and are progressing nicely. \n Our Dollar Tree team delivered a solid increase in same-store sales while cycling its toughest quarterly compare from the prior year, and Family Dollar again demonstrated a sequential acceleration in comp sales. In fact, the Family Dollar segment delivered its strongest quarterly same-store sales increase since we began reporting comps for the banner. \n Results for the first quarter included a sales increase of 4.6% to $5.81 billion, consolidated same-store sales increase of 2.2%. The Dollar Tree segment delivered its 45th consecutive positive comp quarter with a 2.5% comp, and Family Dollar same-store sales delivered a positive 1.9% despite the shift of early SNAP sales into Q4 from February. \n GAAP earnings per share were $1.12. On an adjusted basis, excluding the accelerated rent expense for Family Dollar Stores scheduled to close in 2019 related to ASC 842, diluted EPS was $1.14, within $0.01 of the high-end of our guidance range. \n Other key highlights for the quarter included completing 372 Family Dollar H2 model renovations; completing 324 Dollar Tree Snack Zones; reinitiating our share buyback program, purchasing $100 million worth of shares in the quarter; and continuing to remain on track with our consolidation of store support centers, as many of our Family Dollar associates and new hires are now in the process of moving to the Chesapeake campus.\n As we outlined in the previous call, due to the costs associated with our store optimization initiatives and store support center consolidation project, year-over-year operating income is expected to be lower in the first half of fiscal 2019, but is expected to show improvement in the second half as the initiatives gain traction. The majority of our previously announced store closings are taking place in the second quarter along with the completion of our store support center consolidation. \n For Dollar Tree sales highlights in the first quarter. Dollar Tree saw nice increases in both traffic and ticket, with traffic slightly outpacing the ticket increase. Geographically, all regions comped positively. \n Cadence of comps through the quarter. April was the strongest comp month of the quarter, and March was negative. Both months were impacted by the timing shift of the Easter holiday.\n Dollar Tree continues to deliver solid positive comps in the consumables category, and our seasonal business performed very well. It remains strong, and our Dollar Tree's Easter season was one of our best sell-throughs ever.\n At Dollar Tree Canada, the team delivered mid-single-digit positive comps for the quarter with increases in both ticket and traffic. The consumable comp outperformed discretionary. Top-performing categories included Easter, seasonal, food and household products. \n Highlights in Q1 for Dollar Tree Direct are our online business. We saw increases on our in-line comp sales, items available-for-sale, site visitors and engagement. Our e-commerce team continues to do a great job of engaging with our customers through a number of avenues. Our online content is constantly evolving to reflect our changing assortment, and we are very active in promoting the Dollar Tree brand through blog posts, banner ads and social media. The team also did a great job in producing and distributing our catalogs for the Easter holiday and the upcoming summer season. \n Looking at real estate for both banners in the first quarter, we opened a total of 91 new stores, 65 Dollar Trees and 26 Family Dollar Stores. We relocated or expanded 11 stores, 6 Dollar Tree and 5 Family Dollar. We renovated 372 Family Dollar Stores as part of our H2 renovation initiative, and we re-bannered 45 former Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree for a total of 519 projects during the quarter. We also added freezers and coolers into 102 Dollar Tree stores during the first quarter, now bringing our total Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 5,766. \n During the quarter, we closed 25 stores, 9 Dollar Tree and 16 Family Dollar. And we ended with 15,264 stores, 7,102 being Dollar Trees and 8,162 being Family Dollar.\n Before I turn the call over to Duncan to discuss the Family Dollar business, I'd like to provide you an update on tariffs. \n Our merchandising teams have done a terrific job of mitigating the effects of 25% tariffs imposed under Section 301 for Chinese goods included on List 1, 2 and 3. We are uncertain as to whether or when tariffs will be applied to the List 4 products currently being considered by the U.S. Trade Representative. If tariffs on List 4 products are implemented, we expect that it will be impactful to our business and especially to consumers in general. Until we have more clarity, our outlook excludes the impact of tariffs on List 4 products. However, our outlook continues to include the impact of tariffs on List 1, 2 and 3 products. \n Our teams are doing a nice job managing the controllables and running our business. We continue to believe we are well positioned with the initiatives for both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree banners to capture the significant opportunity ahead of us. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Duncan. Thanks, Kevin. Before turning the call to your questions, I'd like to share some information about our Dollar Tree Plus! test. \n As announced last quarter, we are conducting a test by lifting the dollar price point restriction. Testing is not new to us, and we've got a long track record of using an analytical approach to challenge our own thinking. It's the kind of approach and process that led to the development of our H2 stores in Family Dollar and gave us the confidence to accelerate our store optimization program across the Family Dollar portfolio. \n We spent the past several months laying the groundwork for this test, carefully and thoughtfully designing a test that we believe will allow us to measure the impact of different price points, items and categories on shopping behavior, store profitability and our loyal customers' affinity for the Dollar Tree brand. We'll be leveraging Family Dollar and Dollar Tree distribution center systems and combined merchandise to efficiently get the new products into Dollar Tree stores without disrupting our normal operations. \n For the test, we have selected sales stores located in urban, suburban and rural markets, and we will be measuring the performance versus prior results as well as against our control stores in similar markets. As part of the planning for the test, our Dollar Tree team has been working closely with the Family Dollar merchants to identify the right products to include. We'll be offering a range of items across a number of categories. We will be testing primarily at price points of $3, $4 and $5, and the products will be displayed in 4-foot sections or end caps clearly branded as Dollar Tree Plus! in order to minimize confusion with our dollar values that our customers have come to expect. \n We believe the wow factor of what we have created at Dollar Tree should carry over to this test and continue to build our brand. This is not raising items from our dollar price point to a higher retail, this is about adding new items and categories to add sales and margin. \n The test officially launched a few weeks ago with products hitting the shelves of the first batch of stores. We are in the process of rolling it out to more than 100 test stores, and we'll measure, analyze and adjust products, layout and other variables to ensure we are responding to customer feedback in our continued merchandising efforts. Because it's an iterative process, we now have a set time frame for the test. It's in the early days right now, but we will have more details to share on our progress in the future. \n Lastly, my thanks to all of our store teams that are engaged daily to deliver great service and value to our customers, and a call-out to all of our family Dollar Tree members that are in the process of moving while we consolidate campuses or are staying on to train as necessary. I'm proud of everyone's efforts and achievements during this first quarter. \n Now we're ready to take your questions. So Robby, I'll start and hand it over to Duncan. From the standpoint of what H2 has done, it's put in some key dollar sections throughout the store. And the opportunity there is just to leverage what we've done at Dollar Tree for years, and it gives our customer the opportunity to see these great values. \n Obviously, we've added more frozen food doors that drives traffic, but as you've pointed out, we've also expanded seasonal party. We have a queuing line that sort of gives our customer the last chance to find great values. \n Let me turn it to Duncan on what we see as part of the opportunity to keep driving sales. We're pretty proud of a 10 comp in this fleet of stores, and we're going to continue to drive some additional efforts to see how high it can go. But Duncan? Brad, thanks for your question. We're excited about what we're seeing really across the portfolio. I will tell you that this is just not H2-driven, this is really watching the entire performance of the company going up. And that was demonstrated by 7 out of 8 of our lines of businesses, positive comp in 6 of our 7 zones. So we're seeing a nice balance across the chain. \n H2 obviously is a highlight amongst where we're investing those dollars when we get that nice lift. And we believe that is a sustainable lift as we start to continue to roll this across the United States and most of our store base over time. \n I will tell you that we've had great balance across our promotional sales, our baseline sales. And then when we're preparing to close some of these stores, we're seeing some good clearance sales. So we're getting a real nice, balanced approach. So we feel good about that. And the key here is the base business is solid. And Michael, from -- it's Gary. From my perspective, as we go through this year, with the initiatives we've called out, we're closing almost 400 Family Dollar Stores, a big investment in the H2s will go a long way first half, second half as we build momentum at Family Dollar. \n For Dollar Tree, I'm pretty proud of what the team's accomplished with this quarter in overcoming the 25% tariffs, and we see ourselves chugging along here with the season still responding the way we like to see them come through with great sell-throughs. And our customers are responding, and we're set up in a nice way for the summer season after having some good spring sales on Mother's Day and Easter. So those 2 things together, I think as we go through the back half of the year, we'll see the momentum in the second half. Well, here's how I think about it, Michael. If I had sat down last September and tried to take you through our exposure on those 3, I would have been wrong because our team mitigated most of it -- all of it as we went through our buying trips. And that's the approach we're taking on this List 4. Listen, I don't know when, how big, how much, what items are going to be excluded. We all know what hasn't been detailed out there. All I know is our team is doing the same process, running the same play. How do we mitigate? And that's everything from what we buy, how we buy it, where we buy it, how we ship it. We're going to use all those chapters in our playbook to get to the right answer on it. So -- listen, as it comes to pass or not, we'll keep the group updated, but we are not sitting back on this one. We're also figuring out how we mitigate it if it comes to pass. Well, I think the way I -- obviously, it's -- we import both banners. Not all of it comes from China. The vast majority does, of course. And so the things that we even did back on our January trip, we moved $100 million of seasonal buy out of China. We changed some of the specs that we were shipping items in just so we could pack more in a case, more cases on containers, so you could land it overcoming the tariff. We're looking at other countries. \n The process will be the same. I mean, our merchants now have a pretty good -- I wouldn't wish this on us, but this made our merchants go and take a look at everything we're doing in terms of speccing product, where we're buying it from, negotiating, getting costs in our product. And those are going to be the foundational elements as we go forward into this next round. Scott, this is Gary. Let me just give you my color on it because the way I think about it, the things around our logistics costs, the shortage of truck drivers was an impact this year. That will level out in the back half. The DCs, we've -- listen, we've paid up more just to get people to work in distribution centers, but our productivity over time will catch that up and surpass it. \n Shrink, we have everybody on a red alert. This is -- that's controllable. And where does it come from? Well, as any good retailer, you look inside and outside, but we're just going to be smarter on responding to it more quickly. And Duncan and team are working a lot to get our folks trained. \n But the margin piece, here's still the opportunity that I think we -- besides what we're doing at H2, we still are working real hard on private brands. We have a pretty good base level penetration, but it's going to grow more over time. And the import piece, if -- what we've continued to work on, the Chinese tariffs, it's shining even a brighter light on the opportunities there, and not just the fact that we're buying some items in China. But when we get a chance to move something from a domestic to FOB China to finding the folks that actually make it all enhances the margin there. We've still got runway there, and that's the upside opportunity at Family Dollar on the margin side. Well, a couple of important points, Scot. I mean, you may see some $2 in there. I think the point I was trying to make is we're going to see full price points. You're not going to see $3.25. You're not going to see $4.65. I think our customer, we're going to make this very easy for her to figure out as we go through it. \n And I just want to emphasize, we're not raising retails on the dollar items that our folks have come to love and count on. And I've gotten more letters from schoolteachers that are threatening me in a nice way that I don't dare do that. But I think our opportunity here is to find some additional categories, items that can add to the sales, and that's really the intent of this. It's does our customer understand the wow factor that we've worked so hard on all these years to make Dollar Tree a breakthrough brand in America? And can we take that wow factor and put it into the store and make our customers understand it and they understand the wow as we lift the dollar price point. \n So I think it's going to be very clear to the customer what these items are. They'll see the items with a sticker on them or prepriced in some fashion. That will be very clear to them. And our folks are being trained to answer all those questions. It's -- we want our customers, when they raise their hand and say, \"How much is this?\" it's not going to be because they're confused on the price, it's going to be because they still see these incredible values. \n So we're all over this in terms of getting good execution first during rollout, what do we learn as we do that, and then following up with customer feedback as we go through the process. Well, I mentioned you're going to see, let's just say, 100-plus SKUs. And listen, in the same way we do at Dollar Tree today, you're going to see items come and go while you see it. It's not always going to be there. \n And so when you think about the SKU base, we're going to start someplace and probably end up skating somewhere else, but that's about where we're going to start and just learn as we go. Paul, this is Gary. So we had said a few years ago, 25,000 domestic U.S. and 1,000 in Canada. I think on the U.S. side, I'd still see that opportunity, is going to be both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And I think as we've learned about the business, the opportunity to build Family Dollars, we were probably 60-40, even closer to 70-30 urban versus rural over time. I see that switching. I see our greenfield for Family Dollar being more rural than urban. I don't know if they'll switch to a percentage of 70-30, but probably closer to something like that over time. \n And I think the opportunity is sort of what we've called out. What we deliver is a great box shopping environment, items that people need, that as independent drugstores, grocery stores or other retailers are failing, it gives us an opportunity to grow for really both banners. But at Family Dollar, that's an opportunity in rural America. \n I think Dollar Tree continues to be one of the great brands in America. It cuts through the clutter. We still see the same opportunity across a broad middle of -- we can go anywhere, but Family Dollar probably works best inside the beltway and in the extreme rural. And for Dollar Tree, we still see plenty of opportunities. \n I think you make a good point. We're spending a lot of time and energy on the 1,000 renovations this year on H2. We've got 1,000 -- we're obviously talking about Snack Zones, but we're touching 1,000 Dollar Trees as well. But the opportunity to build more doors is there. It's going to switch more to that in the out years. \n When you take a look at the number of stores we'll have touched on H2 renovations this year, 1,000, the new stores behind us. By the time we get through end of next year, we're going to be closing in -- somewhere close to 40% of our Family Dollar fleet having been touched through our renovation or being new in the last 4 years or so. So it's going to be a change from what our customers have seen in the past. So we're bullish on what H2 can do for us, where it can operate, where we can grow it. And for Dollar Tree, we continue to be, as always, selective on the right sites for a Dollar Tree. But it's still a growth story for both banners as we look forward. And John, it's Gary. Just from the standpoint of the store closures, we took a look at what needed to close outside of lease term. And that's what we're doing in the second quarter this year. As always, we take a look at end of lease term for our fleet of stores to figure out how do we optimize where they're headed for, and actually reach out for our landlords to get input and contributions from them to now help us reinvigorate some of their properties on H2 as we go forward. \n So we'll be doing more of that, but as we go forward, second quarter is going to be where we particularly hit on the stores closing out a lease as we go through the out years either at 75 to 100, depending on the number of stores coming up on any quarter is probably closer to where we'll end up."

            "content": "Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Total sales for the first quarter increased 4.6% to $5.81 billion comprised of $2.96 billion of Dollar Tree and $2.85 billion of Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.2%. On a segment basis, same-store sales for the Dollar Tree segment increased 2.5% or 2.4% when adjusted for Canadian currency, and the Family Dollar comp increased 1.9%. \n Overall, gross profit increased 1.6% to $1.73 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year's quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross margin decreased to 29.7% compared to 30.6% in Q1 of 2018. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was flat at 34.5% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter included higher distribution, depreciation and payroll costs, increased freight costs, primarily outbound freight, as well as a higher proportion of sales in the lower-margin consumable category. These increases were offset by improved shrink and improved initial merchandise markdown. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 24.8% during the first quarter compared with 26.7% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to the following: merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 90 basis points, primarily due to increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise, higher domestic freight costs and inventory markdowns for stores being closed and re-bannered in Q1. \n Shrink increased approximately 50 basis points, resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the current year and an increase in the accrual rate. Distribution costs increased approximately 35 basis points, resulting primarily from higher merchandising and distribution payroll-related costs. Occupancy costs increased approximately 20 basis points, resulting from the $6.7 million of accelerated amortization of the right-of-use assets for Family Dollar Stores we plan to close during 2019. Excluding these costs, occupancy costs would have delevered slightly as a percent of sales. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter increased 40 basis points to 23.1% from 22.7% in the same quarter last year. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales increased to 21.3% compared to 21.1% for the first quarter of 2018. The increase was due to the following: payroll costs increased approximately 20 basis points, primarily due to an increase in store hourly payroll due to an increased average hourly rate, support of company initiatives and an increase in incentive compensation resulting from prior year adjustments due to lower performance of target. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in retirement plan expense. \n Operating and corporate expense increased approximately 5 basis points resulting from higher debit and credit fees, primarily due to increased card penetration. Store operating costs decreased approximately 5 basis points due to lower utility costs, specifically electricity, resulting primarily from the benefit of the LED lighting program in the stores. \n Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Family Dollar segment was 21.6% as a percentage of sales in the first quarter compared to 21.5% for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to the net of the following: payroll expenses increased approximately 25 basis points, primarily due to an increased store hourly payroll -- increased average hourly rate and a support of the company's initiatives related to the costs per store renovations, re-banners and closures. \n Store operating costs increased approximately 10 basis points, due primarily to higher refrigeration repairs and maintenance costs in the current quarter. And depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 25 basis points as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated or amortized.\n Corporate and support expenses increased 20 basis points as a result of $7.6 million of store support center consolidation costs and higher legal fees. On a consolidated basis, operating income was $385.5 million compared with $437.6 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 6.6% compared to 7.9% in the last -- in last year's first quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 20 basis points to 13.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Operating income margin for the Family Dollar segment was 3.2% for the quarter.\n Nonoperating expenses for the quarter totaled $41.6 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.1% compared to 22.6% in the prior year's first quarter. \n For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, the company had net income of $267.9 million or $1.12 per diluted share compared to net income of $160.5 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. This year's first quarter included $6.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share of accelerated rent expense related to the adoption of ASC 842 for lease accounting that was not included in our previous company outlook. Adjusted EPS was $1.14. The prior year's quarter included $0.52 of costs associated with debt refinancing. Today's press release includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures for details on these adjustments. \n Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $725.8 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Our outstanding debt as of May 4, 2019 was approximately $4.3 billion. \n During the first quarter, we invested $100 million in the repurchase of approximately 960,000 shares of stock. At quarter end, we had $900 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We will provide updates on additional share repurchases, if any, following the quarter in which they may occur.\n Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 10.6% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 5.7%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 4.6%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings, re-banners and our sales initiatives for the second quarter. \n Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 3.8% from the same period last year and increased 3% on a selling square-foot basis. \n Capital expenditures were $209.2 million in the first quarter versus $180.9 million in the first quarter of last year. For fiscal 2019, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion, consistent with our initial 2019 outlook. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $151.2 million for the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $151.5 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2019, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $635 million to $645 million.\n Our updated outlook for fiscal 2019 includes the following assumptions: calendar considerations for the remainder of the year include that there will be 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will negatively impact Q4 sales. Our guidance includes the expectation that Section 301 tariffs will be 25% on List 1, 2 and 3 goods. However, our guidance does not include potential tariffs on List 4 goods. \n Our company outlook on March 6, 2019 included $95 million in discrete costs related to our Family Dollar store optimization initiative and our store support center consolidation. With the increased visibility of our cadence of projects, we now expect to incur approximately 90% of these costs in the first half of the year. In Q1, we incurred approximately $28 million for these initiatives. Our Q2 outlook includes an estimated $57 million in costs related to these initiatives. As noted with our company outlook on March 6, we did not include charges for lease obligation and related expenses for any closed doors in 2019 as we could not estimate the P&L impact until after the adoption of ASC 842, the new lease accounting standard. We now expect to incur approximately $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share of costs in Q2 related to store closings for lease obligations and related costs.\n We entered into new import freight contracts effective May 1 based on negotiations in April. The new contracts were unfavorable compared to our prior outlook and will add approximately $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share of expense in the back half of the year that was not included in our original company outlook for fiscal 2019 provided on March 6.\n We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wages and completing the company's initiatives plans. We expect year-over-year domestic freight costs as a percentage of sales to increase in the first half of the year and then flatten out in the second half. Net interest expense will be approximately $40.5 million in Q2 and approximately $161.8 million for fiscal 2019. \n We cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we've not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases for the year. Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 22.6% for the second quarter and 22.4% for fiscal 2019. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 238.6 million shares for Q2 and 238.8 million shares for the full year. \n For the second quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.66 billion to $5.76 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.64 to $0.73. These estimates are based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and includes approximately $57 million of discrete costs. Additionally, as I've noted, our outlook now includes approximately $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share of costs related to Q2 store closures for lease obligations and related costs that was not included in the company's previous outlook. \n For fiscal 2019, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $23.51 billion and $23.83 billion based on a low-single-digit same-store sales increase of approximately 1% of selling square footage growth. The company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for full year fiscal 2019 will range between $4.77 and $5.07. This includes discrete costs of $95 million or $0.31 per share, as previously disclosed. Additionally, our outlook now includes $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share in store closure related costs and import freight costs of $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to increased import freight rates, as previously described in our updated outlook. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Gary. Robby, this is Kevin. I think as we think about it, obviously, we're working to drive top line, first and foremost, right, because that helps leverage all of our fixed costs at the end of the day. \n We've got a limited number of stores we've completed this time. Still a lot of work going on. The freezers and the coolers, adult beverage tend to drive a little bit lower margin at the end of the day. So we have to offset that with the party and the things like that. So it's a little bit too early, given the small number of stores in general. But I think in general, obviously, we're looking for an EBITDA lift. I don't think that the model is built such that we'll ever have EBITDA of a Dollar Tree store. Just given the amount of consumables we sell to our core customer for our Family Dollar banners versus discretionary business we've had in our Dollar Tree business, they will never -- they are never going to quite equate at the end of the day. But the idea, obviously, is to drive sales and drive improvement in that overall EBITDA margin as we go forward. Well, I think if you look at the guidance, Michael, from where we started out for the year, basically, if you take the fact that on a GAAP basis for the quarter, you would have to reduce the high-end by $0.03, and you'd basically bring up the low-end by, I believe, it was $0.08. And -- so you have at adjustment. \n And then beyond that, it's just the range always narrows as you go further down the end of the quarter, a quarter further into the year. We now have 3 quarters left, so we have roughly $0.40 range when we first started the year. We're now down to a $0.30 range. But then, otherwise, to your point, it's just -- it's the initiatives, the 2 new items that we've brought in. So I don't think there's anything to read into it other than that. From my perspective, we didn't -- the only changes to the guidance were for the lease obligation costs that we brought in. Again, as we noted, we couldn't give you those at the beginning of the year, given the fact that we had to adopt and implement ASC 842 before we could even calculate those costs. And then obviously, the new item with the new contracts on our import freight. No, Michael, I think as a backdrop of our outlook in March, we wanted to give a little longer-term outlook, given the significant investment we were making in this year in particular around the initiatives to drive improved performance in our Family Dollar Stores. And we're obviously very focused on all of our store initiatives and the projects. And as Gary and Duncan have described, we're making really good progress, and we like where we're going there. So that's very, very positive. \n Given another point in time, I think -- I don't think we've changed necessarily our viewpoint. We've said at that point in time that it was based upon the GAAP number. We haven't really updated anything at this point, so I think it's -- I don't think anything's changed and we'll just continue to update you probably later in the year as we continue to work forward through this year and we have more data to work with. Yes. This is Kevin. I'll give you some background on that. Obviously, we're very disappointed in our results, and we own that. And we have not executed at the level we've expected to. So -- and this is, I would tell you, this is not sitting in the corner of somebody's desk, this is front and center for everybody, the operations team, the loss prevention team, the logistics team, management. \n I think one of the things we have fought a little bit is our inventory levels. Again, our inventory levels have grown. If you saw for the first time this quarter, we're actually able to bring inventory levels down, and that's going to be a continued effort there by Duncan and team as we look at that. We've made changes in the reporting structure and leadership in regards to over -- looking at the Family Dollar banners with regards to loss prevention team and how we're looking at that. We have put in place several new programs. We're putting in a new analytics software. So we're doing a lot of things. And again, as you know, what we're working on now probably takes a little bit of time to see the benefits of, but my expectation is we see the effect of the negativity dissipate somewhat as we get towards the back half. \n Now we still have work to do. I think it's a disappointing trend, but I think there is a lot of work going on to really address this on an overall basis. No, they're absolutely up. I think as we look at our gross margin Family Dollar, you kind of have to look at it in buckets is kind of the way I would think about it. So if we look at the -- overall, if we look at just the product margin, including freight, obviously, freight was a big headwind last year. A little bit of a headwind this year in the first half. We expect that to flatten out in the back half. \n As we look at actual merchandise costs, a little bit of pressure, obviously, from selling more lower margin in consumable goods, a lot of work going on to really energize the discretionary business to help offset that, so that as we see that discretionary business continue to improve, I think we have the ability to offset that as we go forward. \n I think, obviously, markdowns this year will be a very tough year of markdowns because obviously we have all the initiative markdowns going into the P&L. I think occupancy cost was actually a good point here in Q1. As I noted, excluding the $6.7 million related to the adoption of ASC 842, we actually would have shown a slight deleveraging of occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. So those things are positive. \n So I think we'll still see pressure as we go through this year in particular because of some of the one-time costs and some of the initiatives things going on. I think as we get sales -- continue to see sales improve, that helps leverage some of these things and gets us back on track to improving it back to where we would like to see it. Yes. I mean, I think freight, we've been fairly transparent on it in the sense of, from a domestic standpoint, we've said it's a headwind in the first half of the year. I believe it becomes basically flat in the second half. \n We've seen just some -- from an overall perspective, inbound has started to regulate itself a little bit. It seems like domestic's still running a little high. And then, obviously, we gave you the news on the import. I think that's about $0.05, but it's back half related if you think about that. \n Payroll in general, again, store hourly payroll is going to continue to basically be up slightly as we go through the year, probably no different than what we saw in Q1. We continue to see, from an employment standpoint, an increase in average hourly rate in our stores. And I think that's part of it. So we have that. And then I think from a shrink perspective, as I said, I think it's likely to continue to be up in Q2. My view is we need to see that start to level out as we get to the second half. \n I think as -- the other thing to remind everybody is initially, when we were talking about the costs related to the initiatives at the beginning of the year, we said about 75% of those costs would be incurred in the first half of the year. We're now, today, we said roughly 90% of those costs would be incurred in the first half. So based upon the fact that we can -- we've seen the cadence and the efficiency we've gained there and how our projects are laying out for the year, we've been able to see that. And obviously, it gives us that foundational base of the $57 million of costs that we're going to see in Q2 related to all those initiatives. And those touch many, many lines. It touches labor. It touches markdowns. It touches various other costs as well. So those are all kind of blended in there at the end of the day, Paul."

Today's conference is being recorded.\n At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Randy Guiler, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Jordan. Good morning and welcome to our call to discuss Dollar Tree's fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2020. With me on today's call will be our President and CEO, Mike Witynski; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler.\n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Results might differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors included in our most recent press release, most recent 8-K, 10-Q and annual report, which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so.\n Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n I will now turn the call over to Mike Witynski, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer. \nMichael Witynski: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining me today. What a year. I believe that from now -- that years from now, many of us will reflect upon 2020 as being one of the most unique, unpredictable and challenging business environments of our career. My sincerest gratitude goes out to our 195,000 plus associates working in more than 15,600 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores and in 26 distribution centers and to our field leadership teams as well as our store support team here in Chesapeake, Virginia. Your commitment and dedication to protect and serve our customers is critical to our company's success. As an essential retailer in the value segment, we will continue to be part of the solution for millions of households across North America.\n Additionally, I would like to recognize our business partners, both supply chain and suppliers, for their efforts to support our business throughout the year. In 2020, we exceeded $25 billion in annual sales for the first time, and we have a long runway of growth ahead of us. As our business grows, so does the need and support from each of our business partners. We appreciate your continued support.\n The recent trends have been encouraging. COVID cases are on the decline, and vaccinations are on the rise. However, we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to protect each other until this pandemic is behind us.\n I am very pleased with the team's operating performance for the fourth quarter, highlighted by solid same-store sales increase, improved gross margin and expense leverage. The team delivered EPS increase of 310% compared to the prior year's quarters or 19% when adjusted for discrete charges in the prior year. Our results included a 4.9% enterprise comp increase, an 80 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 90 base increase in operating profit margin when compared to the prior year's adjusted numbers.\n Our Dollar Tree segment delivered another quarter of positive same-store sales with a 2.4% increase. January was the strongest month of the quarter, followed by November. In fact, January was our strongest monthly comp since April of 2019. December was slightly negative as store traffic was impacted by an escalation in COVID cases, resulting in expanded lockdowns and significantly fewer holiday social gatherings among families, companies, churches and schools. As we have seen in the onset of the pandemic, sales were again driven by average ticket, which increased 17.9% as shoppers continue to consolidate trips. Comp transaction count declined 13.1%. \n We delivered a 36.1% gross margin, and Dollar Tree's operating margin, which included $13.8 million in COVID-related costs, came in at 16% operating income. Categories performing well included crafts, seasonal, household products, floral, kitchenware and beauty and eyewear. Building on the continued success of craft assortment, we completed the rollout of Crafter's Square to all U.S. Dollar Tree stores in January. Inspiring the creativity of our customers is at the core of Dollar Tree, and we are thrilled to provide an even broader assortment of art and crafts supplies at tremendous values. With our $1 fixed price point and more than 7,500 U.S. store locations, Crafter's Square presents customers with an unlimited solutions for current learn-from-home and work-from-home environment.\n Additionally, terrific opportunity exist for DIY home projects and decor, crafts for the entire family, seasonal decorations and handmade gifts. Our shoppers love the expanded assortment, which is validated by the excitement Crafter's Square is generating across social media platforms, including YouTube and Instagram.\n Regarding our Dollar Tree Plus!, our shoppers love the values, and we exceeded our initial sales plan for the fourth quarter. We had great sell-through on our seasonal products, on our toys and household consumables. We are on schedule to kick off the previously announced expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! this month. We are expanding multi-price assortment from the current base of 120 stores to a total of 500 stores and will be completed by August. Additionally, we are capturing great buying synergies as the majority of the $3 and $5 merchandise for the DT Plus! will be offered in both banners.\n Family Dollar sales highlights for the quarter included an 8.1% comp increase, comprised of a 21.9% expansion in average ticket, partially offset by 11.3% decline in transaction count. This is similar to the ticket traffic trip consolidation dynamic we have seen since Q1 of 2020.\n Regarding the cadence of comps, all 3 months were positive, with January being the strongest month. As a reminder, all Family Dollar stores were closed on Christmas Day in 2020, which has impacted December comp results as approximately 5,600 stores were open for business the previous year.\n January was Family Dollar's strongest monthly comp since May of last year. We saw solid sales across many of the discretionary categories that we have been focused on improving, including home decor, apparel, household cleaning, lawn and garden, party, beauty care and seasonal.\n The consumables side of the business delivered another positive quarterly comp at 6.2%, and the discretionary comp was a strong 13.5% comp. In Q4, discretionary as a percent of net sales at Family Dollar increased 120 basis points to 26.2% of sales. Similar to recent quarters, based on third-party data, our market share in discretionary grew 2x faster than the remaining market in Q4. Late in 2020, we launched our initial test for produce and frozen needs at select Family Dollar stores, targeting markets where shoppers have fewer local grocery options. We want to provide shoppers with convenient access to basic produce items as well as beef, poultry and pork. We plan to expand our test in 2021.\n We recently announced the expansion of our new partnership with Instacart platform across the U.S. Same-day delivery is another example of meeting the evolving needs of Family Dollar shoppers. The initial results have exceeded our expectations, and we continue to receive very positive feedback from shoppers. These transactions have materially higher average ticket, and we believe the Instacart platform is enabling us to broaden our dollar -- our Family Dollar customer base. Interestingly, in the first 3 weeks of the national rollout, more than 80% of Family Dollar stores had 1 or more Instacart transactions.\n As always, our most important scorecards come from our shoppers. We are seeing considerable improvements in our customer satisfaction survey scores. For Q4, we saw record numbers across each of the 4 key categories: store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. In fact, each of these categories have shown improvement for 3 consecutive quarters. Contributors to these -- this success is an enhanced Family Dollar brand strategy program that clearly conveys expectations and examples to our store teams. And the chains' annual store manager turnover are at the best in over a decade. The improved customer satisfaction results gives us confidence that we will be able to retain shoppers that discovered or reengage with Family Dollar during the pandemic.\n Regarding Dollar Tree Canada, the team delivered another solid quarter, exceeding its plan for sales, gross margin and operating income. From a real estate perspective, we completed more than 280 projects, including 124 new stores, 11 relocations, 106 Family Dollar renovations and 45 store closings. We ended the year with 15,685 stores.\n We accomplished a great deal in 2020. Much of this was made possible by our 2019 initiatives that really set the stage to gain traction and momentum in 2020 and beyond. To quickly recap, in 2019, we consolidated our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar store support centers into 1 campus, greatly improving efficiencies through enhanced communication, collaboration and support. We made tremendous progress on Family Dollar store optimization initiatives by rebannering 200 stores, closing more than 400 stores and doubling the pace of our renovation program to more than 1,000 per year.\n We also launched our initial test for Dollar Tree Plus!, and we realigned our leadership team to enhance and align the consistency of communication, strategies, process and workflows. For example, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar merchants went through 2020 in complete unison for buying calendars, buying trip meetings, planning dates and category performance reviews. This strength in alignment was very evident in the success of our recent virtual buying trip in January, which is our biggest buying trip of the year. These initiatives help build the foundation for 2020 performance.\n The progress we have made at Family Dollar in the past despite the pandemic has been remarkable. We are benefiting from improved store conditions and better execution on initiatives, resulting in market share gains. We have also seen improved customer satisfaction scores, store turnover and shrink improvements. I am convinced that Family Dollar will exit the pandemic as a much stronger organization. This progress is why I'm more enthusiastic about the opportunities in 2021 and beyond, including the expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! and the growth of our new Combination Stores into small towns across America.\n I will go into more detail on our plans for 2021 after Kevin speaks to the Q4 performance and our outlook. Kevin? \nKevin Wampler: Thank you, Mike, and good morning. For the fourth quarter, consolidated net sales increased 7.2% to $6.77 billion, comprised of $3.71 billion of Dollar Tree and $3.06 billion of Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.9% or 5% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations. Comps for Family Dollar increased 8.1% and Dollar Tree segment increased 2.4%.  \n Overall, gross profit for the enterprise increased 9.8% to $2.15 billion, and gross margin improved 80 basis points to 31.8%. The gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 10 basis points to 36.1% when compared to the prior year's quarter. The factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance include distribution costs increased 40 basis points primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. This includes the continued ramp-up of the 2 new distribution centers as well as $4.4 million or 10 basis points of COVID-related expenses primarily premium pay and bonuses. These higher DC costs as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by a 20 basis point improvement in markdowns and a 5 basis point improvement in shrink. Merchandise costs, including freight, also improved 5 basis points. Improvements in merchandise mix and markdown were mostly offset by increased freight costs.\n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 200 basis points to 26.6% in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: markdown expense improved 100 basis points due to lower promotional activity and improved sell-through of seasonal merchandise and apparel; occupancy costs decreased approximately 50 basis points from leverage on the 8.1% comp sales increase; shrink improved 35 basis points on improved inventory results; distribution costs improved approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year quarter; the current year quarter included approximately $3.2 million or 10 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium paying bonuses; and regarding merchandise costs, including freight, improvements in merchandise mix and markdown were essentially offset by increased freight costs during the quarter.\n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 540 basis points to 21.7% of net sales compared to 27.1% in Q4 a year ago. The prior year's quarter included a $313 million noncash pretax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge, an $18 million charge to the litigation reserve. Excluding these items from the prior year's quarter, SG&A expenses improved 20 basis points from an adjusted 21.9% of net sales.\n For the fourth quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales improved slightly to 20.1% of net sales when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved approximately 30 basis points and is comprised of the following: payroll expenses increased approximately $7.2 million or 20 basis points for costs associated with COVID-19-related payroll and bonuses. Additionally, increased incentive compensation was partially offset by lower health insurance benefits.\n Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 20 basis points primarily from reduced travel and lower legal and professional fees. The depreciation cost decreased 10 basis points. Excluding goodwill impairment and litigation reserve charges from the prior year's quarter, the SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 80 basis points to 20.6% compared to an adjusted 21.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019.\n Depreciation improved 30 basis points, primarily from leverage on strong comp sales increase. Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 30 basis points primarily due to lower advertising and travel costs as a percentage of net sales. Payroll-related expenses improved approximately 15 basis points, and store facility costs improved approximately 5 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales and lower electricity costs. Corporate and support expenses increased 20 basis points primarily related to higher incentive comp and stock compensation expense compared to the prior year's quarter.\n Operating income improved 173% to $681.6 million compared with $249.4 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 10.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 3.9% in the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $313 million goodwill impairment and $18 million litigation reserve from the prior year's quarter, operating income margin improved 90 basis points from the adjusted 9.2%.\n Q4 of 2020 included total incremental operating costs of $24.8 million for COVID-19-related expenses. These incremental costs by segment were $13.8 million for Dollar Tree, $10.6 million for Family Dollar and $0.4 million for Corporate, Support and Other. Nonoperating expenses totaled $34.2 million, comprised of net interest expense.\n Our effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 41.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The prior year rate was affected by the noncash goodwill impairment charge that was not tax deductible. Without the goodwill impairment charge, the tax rate was -- for Q4 2019 would have been 16.6%, which included a reduction in tax expense of $24.6 million for the reversal of our valuation allowance related to the company's foreign net operating loss carryforwards.\n Company net income of $502.8 million or $2.13 per diluted share, which included $0.08 per diluted share for COVID-19-related expenses. This compares to a net earnings of $123 million or $0.52 per share in the prior year's quarter and an adjusted earnings per share of $1.79.\n Combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $1.42 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. The company paid off the $300 million legacy Family Dollar note during the quarter. Outstanding debt as of January 30, 2021, was $3.25 billion.\n During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.83 million shares for $200 million. With the Board action announced this morning, we now have $2.4 billion authorized for share repurchases. We will continue to invest in our business and will provide postquarter updates on share repurchase activity.\n Inventory for Dollar Tree at year-end declined 5.9% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 3.7%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 9.2%. Inventory for Family Dollar at year-end increased 0.5% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 1.8%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 11.3%. Our inventory levels improved in Q4 and will continue to be more productive with lower inventory, significantly increasing our inventory turns.\n Capital expenditures were $191.8 million in the fourth quarter versus $252.5 million in Q4 last year. For fiscal 2021, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures will be focused on 600 new stores and 1,250 Family Dollar H2 renovations. The new stores will be 400 Dollar Tree stores and 200 Family Dollar stores, including both H2 and combo stores, formats, based on market locations. The addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to select Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores, IT system enhancements and projects, development of our Chesapeake campus, installation of LED lighting and HVAC and flooring replacements in select stores and the ongoing construction for the second phase of our new distribution center in Ocala, Florida.\n Depreciation and amortization totaled $182.9 million for Q4 compared to $179.1 million in the fourth quarter last year. And for the year, depreciation expense totaled $686.6 million. For fiscal 2021, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $720 million to $730 million.\n Due to a number of variables and uncertainties, we're not providing specific sales and EPS guidance. These variables include unknowns related to the COVID pandemic and its impact to customer shopping patterns, timing and magnitude of government stimulus and potential for the timing of changes with federal minimum wage.\n I do want to share some points to assist your modeling for 2021. The February storms have brought snow and freezing temperatures through Texas and much of the central part of the states, resulting in more than 5,500 lost store days for closures of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores in the areas most impacted. Stores are now back open and operating, but Q1 sales will be impacted from these closures.\n We will be cycling the 2020 onset of the COVID pandemic in 20 -- in Q1. Our business segments were impacted in different ways a year ago. At Dollar Tree, both sales and gross margin were negatively impacted by losing discretionary Easter-related seasonal sales. As a result, in Q1 of 2020, the Dollar Tree segment had a 0.9% comp decrease and a 31.9% gross margin. At Family Dollar, for Q1, we'll be cycling a 15.5% comp increase in the prior year, which will be our toughest quarterly compare for 2021.\n We face headwinds for minimum wage and freight costs in 2021. The minimum wage has increased in certain states and localities and may increase nationally depending on the outcome of future legislation. The currently scheduled minimum wage increases are estimated to increase store payroll by $45 million to $50 million in 2021.\n We're experiencing some delays in receiving import merchandise as a result of worldwide equipment shortages and issues with port congestion. As a result of current market conditions, we're seeing significant increases in cost of import freight and moderate pressure on domestic freight. We currently project $80 million to $100 million of additional costs in fiscal 2021 as a result of these market conditions. These costs primarily affect the first 3 quarters of the year as currently projected.\n We believe these headwinds will be more than offset by productivity and cost savings initiatives, such as Crafter's Square, H2 and combo stores, continued focus in shrink and reduced COVID-related costs.\n We incurred COVID-related costs of $279 million in 2020 to support our associates, stores and customers. We will continue to incur costs for COVID activities in 2021 but, we believe, at a materially reduced level.\n We've got tailwinds as well. COVID relief checks are anticipated to provide a significant lift. We also expect that the COVID -- the base customer traffic could return to more normalized levels.\n Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q1, approximately $135 million for fiscal 2021. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.5% for the first quarter and 23.2% for fiscal 2021.\n Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 234.5 million shares for Q1 and 234.8 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. But as noted, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $2.4 billion.\n Over the past several years, the company has reduced its debt from the acquisition by over $5 billion, returning to a solid investment-grade rating. With our strong flexible balance sheet, we'll be able to increase store growth and return to share repurchases as an important part of capital allocation going forward. We'd expect to complete the $2.4 billion share repurchase authorization over the next 2 years or so.\n And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thanks, Kevin. Again, I'm extremely proud of the team's efforts for fiscal 2020. For the year, our customer satisfaction scores are improving, and we are experiencing our lowest store manager turnover rates in many years.\n The team delivered an enterprise comp increase of 6.1%. Gross profit increased by more than $740 million, a 70 basis point improvement. We delivered our SG&A costs, which were flat year-over-year, as a percent of net sales despite incurring $279 million or 110 basis points in COVID-related costs.\n Enterprise operating profit margin improved 70 basis points to 7.4%. The company repurchased 400 million shares and ended the year with more than $1.4 billion in cash on the balance sheet. And we delivered annual diluted EPS of $5.65.\n This morning, we announced our newest and tested concept that is working remarkably well in rural markets. What we refer to is our combination or combo store format. As I have said in the past, we will continue to refine strategic store formats designed to serve more customers in all types of geographic markets while improving store productivity, margins and returns. The Combination Store leverages both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve small towns across the country. The store combines Family Dollar's great value and assortment with Dollar Tree's thrill of the hunt and $1 price point, creating a new format targeted for populations ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 people. These are markets where we traditionally do not open a Dollar Tree store alone.\n We opened the first test Combination Store in late 2019, followed by 2 additional test stores in early 2020. Closely analyzing the store performance and customer feedback and utilizing learnings, we refined the concept. Between July 2020 and calendar year-end, we opened or renovated 32 additional stores. And currently, we have nearly 50 new stores in small towns like Linden, Alabama, Hogansville, Georgia, Bovina, New York and dozens of others. Compared to other small market Family Dollar stores, these Combination Stores are delivering same-store sales lift of greater than 20% on average. Combination Stores are more productive, delivering higher gross margins and are better leveraging store costs. Our successful H2 stores and Combination Stores will both be part of the Family Dollar and new store and renovation strategy moving forward.\n We are extremely pleased with our customers' response to the new Combination Store concept. Our goal is to have formats that leverage the best of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve customers in all types of geographic markets. We believe we can continue to change, evolve and improve.\n To really share why we are very excited to introduce this new format, we are providing a 3-minute video, along with photos, introducing the new Combination Stores at FamilyDollar.com/ComboStores. Please go check it out.\n Our teams worked incredibly hard throughout fiscal 2020. I could not be more proud of our team's commitment, dedication and focus. We believe our proven strategic store formats and accelerated store growth plan, 1,250 planned store renovations for the year, several key sales and traffic-driven initiatives, along with a robust balance sheet, will enable us to deliver long-term value for each of our stakeholders, our customers, associates, suppliers and shareholders.\n Operator, we are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] It looks like we have our first question on the line from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: Wanted to ask just first about payroll and the freight costs that you called out. And just if you could help us understand at a greater level of detail how you're getting to that $45 million to $50 million impact from payroll and $80 million to $100 million on freight. And I think the comment was that these pressures are expected to be more than offset by other factors. So just want to make sure I'm understanding -- are you suggesting that you are expecting EBIT growth in 2021? Or maybe you can just elaborate on that. \nKevin Wampler: Sure, Kelly. It's Kevin. Yes. So we wanted to give some color, obviously, as to what's going on. Obviously, not giving specific guidance given the many variables that are out there right now. The $45 million to $50 million that we spoke to in regards to payroll is very specific. Our operations, labor department looks at that by state. We know there's approximately 30 states affected this year. We know our labor pool in those states. We know how many hourly people we have, and we go through a calculation on that.\n Now that's no different than any other year. This is just really the first time we've given you a number as to what it relates to. We have done -- we have faced these same type of increases over the last couple of years. But this time, we were just trying to put some graphics around it to help people understand the size of that.\n As it relates the freight costs, again, our current projection is roughly $80 million to $100 million, really fairly comparable across both banners. It is much more import related than domestic related so it's been probably 75-25, 80-20 as far as import related at this point in time. And that is just based upon current market conditions that we currently face. As many of you know, we go to market with our freight contract or import freight contracts in the spring here. These are negotiated in March and April and -- to go live then in May. So really, a lot has been talked about in the marketplace in general. So I don't think there should be a lot of surprise around it. And again, we're just trying to give an idea of the size of that.\n And then obviously, if we look at the offsets, so obviously, COVID costs in and of themselves last year as we talked about were $279 million. If we -- even if we said we spent at the same rate we did in Q4, which is roughly $25 million, we'll spend, obviously, significantly less going into the new year. So I'll let you guys do the math on that at the end of the day, but those are the puts and takes.\n And obviously, it goes beyond that. Obviously, driving sales -- I think we obviously talked this morning about how we'll continue to drive sales. But also there's other items. When you look at shrink as a potential good item after maybe a second year in a row after having an upswing a couple of years prior to that. So some good progress being made there. We're still not where we think we can get to, but really proud of the teams, the operations teams and the asset protection teams that have been working hard to mitigate the issue that we've faced there. \nKelly Bania: That's very helpful. And then just wanted to ask, on the Combination Stores, any color you can give us on the new store economic model, the cost of the stores, the size and sales per square foot and how the returns maybe compare to the H2s. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. So right now, the stores are about 10,500 square feet. So they're slightly bigger than what a normal Dollar Tree would be. And the -- we like the economics. Our sales are exceeding utilized share -- the comp sales are 20% or greater on average. And when we're going into a new market, they're performing better than our expectation of when it was just a Family Dollar as a stand-alone store.\n And you can imagine the margins are enhanced because now you've got the mix of Dollar Tree product in there at $1 price point and in the categories that normally are higher margins. And you're leveraging it with 1 store manager and 1 store team and delivering 2 brands to a customer and to a small town. And we like the results. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: Great. I wanted to ask on freight again. Kevin, as you mentioned, you guys do renegotiate freight every spring. And I guess, I'm a little confused why you'd be seeing so much pressure, at least in the fourth quarter. I guess are they allowed to put surcharges on your negotiated rates? Or -- and I understand, I guess, you're assuming it will be just higher pressure for this year. But maybe you could share a little more color on that. \nKevin Wampler: Sure, Joe. As you look at it, we contract for a certain volume of containers. It's been a big year from an import standpoint, obviously. And so at some point, if you exceed your volume, you do pay more potentially based upon on the marketplace. The spot market, and you guys see all the same information we see, has been up significantly in general. And again, then a part of it is supply and demand. There is a backup in China, in Asia. And to get goods move in some instances, people are paying more. And it's not just us. You've heard other retailers over the last 2 weeks speak to it as well. So it's not a Dollar Tree-specific issue. It's an industry issue.\n And our team is working through that and moving our goods. We've been able to keep our seasonal goods coming in, and feel good about that. But in general, based on where the marketplace is projected to be, that is our best projection as we sit here today. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. And then a follow-up question. As you think about '21, and I know you're not giving too much detail on guidance. But I guess, how should we think about the profitability of the 2 different brands? Family Dollar has been much better. We've seen a lot of improvement there. Should we expect continued greater improvement within the Family Dollar profitability versus kind of stable at the Dollar Tree business? \nKevin Wampler: Well, Joe, I think as we think about it, I mean, we obviously always think there's opportunity in both. Even if we've made a big leap this year with the Family Dollar operating income going in the right direction, it's still not where we want it to be ultimately. We've made big strides. And we do believe, obviously, as we began 2020, we spoke a lot about discretionary business and building that side of the house and us being a more important player in building that kind of muscle. And obviously, the pandemic helped with that, but we do believe that we've made strides. And again, I think Mike, in his comments, talked about the fact that are just -- we're growing twice the market in that piece of business. So that's a great opportunity to continue to go.\n But that doesn't mean we don't think there's other opportunities as well. You look at the -- as we talk about the combo store, we think that's a great opportunity. We believe there's, at a minimum, 3,000 locations out there where we can play an important role in our customers' lives on a day-to-day basis and be their place to shop for many, many things. They may not live close to a large metropolitan area. And so it's a big opportunity as we think about it. So a lot of opportunity there.\n I think on the Dollar Tree side, I think, again, we always believe there's opportunity. And Dollar Tree has evolved over the years, as you well know, in the sense of we always reinvent ourselves. Most recently, we've talked about Snack Zone. We've talked about our Crafter's Square initiative. And again, some of these initiatives are traffic driving. Some of these are really margin driving and -- but it's always relevant to the consumer, and the $1 fixed price point does not go out of style. People love the value it provides. And now we can add upon that, obviously, taking the Dollar Tree Plus! opportunity, expanding into 500 stores, continuing to learn and build upon that and really be able to take that and benefit both banners by taking that $3 and $5 product. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Joe, this is Mike. I agree with Kevin. I am so excited about 2021. And I absolutely believe there's growth for both banners. And Kevin hit on them. I'll start with Family Dollar. We are absolutely going to come out stronger on the backside of the pandemic than on the front side for a lot of reasons. And I think about what Kevin was speaking to on March 4 of last year, our comp sales in consumables were strong low single-digit quarter after quarter. And where we needed to focus our energy was on our discretionary side. And it was a year ago in December that Rick McNeely was assigned to be the lead merchant for both banners and really leverage synergies where possible and bring disciplines and capabilities to the Family Dollar team.\n So during this pandemic, we didn't just survive through it. We thrived through it and changed our disciplines and strategies. And we looked at -- in our merchandising, we looked at our basic assortment of what we're carrying by sharper price points. We got better values. And we're not going to go back to the old way. We're going to improve upon that. And the pandemic really accelerated our inventory from the past and really flushed that through last year. And then our new receipts coming in on all the disciplines that I just got done describing are really selling it at a great mix, stronger sell-throughs, less markdowns and better turns.\n The second thing is our stores. You heard us talk about our customer satisfaction scores across the board for 3 quarters are improving. We've invested a lot in getting better initiatives and execution in our stores, and our customers are responding. And we'll have that carrying forward compared to going into the pandemic.\n The fourth thing, as Kevin said, is we've got clear direction now on a format strategy. We've got H2 format that is continuing to produce 10% comps when we go in and renovate them, and we're going to renovate another 1,250 of them this year. And then this wonderful new store of a combo store in small towns that is producing a 20% comp, and so another thing that we didn't have prior to last year going into the pandemic.\n And then our balance sheet as Kevin spoke about. We generate a lot of cash flow. And we've got $1.4 billion on our balance sheet, and that enables us to be very flexible and grow this company like we haven't grown before because we don't have to pay $1 billion to $1.2 billion every year to pay down the debt. We can use it flexible to grow this company and grow shareholder value.\n And then the last thing I would say on Family Dollar's side is -- and we haven't even been in the digital and omnichannel business. And you heard us just now dipping our toes into Instagram and we're -- or Instacart. And the Instacart is just getting a huge response for our customers and it give us a broader -- able to serve a broader segment of this customer with Instacart. So there's another upside with our digital and omnichannel.\n And then you've heard us about Dollar Tree Plus!. We will always grow that business, and we'll find those categories. And now we have our Crafter's Square in all Dollar Tree -- we just got it done in January. We're going on a goal this entire year with Crafter's Square. And you've heard us talk about Dollar Tree Plus!. So we're going to drive that Dollar Tree Plus.\n And then Dollar Tree didn't perform that well because of those COVID related -- if you look at our fourth quarter, our November comps in Dollar Tree were spectacular, and our January was the best in 2 years. What happened was December lockdown, because of -- the COVID cases increased and spiked at the highest levels across the country. And you all saw that. And the states, because of that, increased the lockdowns. People did not go around. And what happens is there wasn't any celebrations. The Dollar Tree feeds those celebrations in the schools, in the churches, at-home/at-work parties, and all of our party categories flourish during the first 10 days before Christmas. And it just didn't happen because of COVID.\n Outside of that, we had a great quarter with 2.4% comp, which was better than the fourth quarter in 2019, and we had a COVID problem. So we delivered 36 plus margin and a 16% op income at Family Dollar, and I believe we can beat that next year. So yes, to answer your question, I believe we're going to have a successful year at both banners for those reasons. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: I guess I wanted to maybe just follow up your comments with maybe some bigger picture questions then looking beyond 2021. Just curious on -- obviously, 2020 was a pretty unique year, to say the least. So just curious, as you kind of move and turn the corner here, if you can give some comments on long-term margin potential as we think about the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banner, given what's transpiring on the merchandise front and with all the new formats. What would be the timetable do you think to be able to navigate all the headwinds and perhaps return to some of the levels we've seen in prior years? \nKevin Wampler: Yes. Paul, this is Kevin. I'll start, and I'll let Mike chime in if he has anything. But I guess, I think about it in a couple of ways. One, one of the words you guys have all heard me use before, and I think it's very true within our company, is continuous improvement. We go into every year expecting to improve in all aspects of our business, and whether that's driving sales, reducing costs, being a more efficient company. And so that's just the way our mindset is. And so while I don't know that I have a timetable to give you in a sense of certain milestones, as I sit here today, and again, part of that is, obviously, the uncertainty of what's going on out there in the world with the pandemic. And -- but we would expect continuous improvement. And I think Mike has shared a lot of that with all of you this morning and the idea.\n So we entered the year. The expectation is we're going to improve our operating income for both banners when we think about it. Whether we can do it with some of the things going on in the world, that's yet to be seen. But there's a great opportunity. And I think that's the most important thing, is the way we always want to improve. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Paul, I agree with Kevin that we will continuously improve and drive our path on Family Dollar's side. As you've heard me, we have not arrived yet, and there is upside because we just cycled through our first year, and we are -- continue to look at our assortment, our allocations and improve upon the products that we have and price points.\n And I think on the Dollar Tree side, we have things ahead of us, just like the tariffs. Once we got it in front of us, we know how to manage around it. And I would say the short term, the freight thing, once we're aware of it, we're going to figure out how to mitigate it and grow the margins and grow Dollar Tree. Dollar Tree, for 14 years, has had a quarter-after-quarter of kind of positive comp store sales growth, except for first quarter last year, and here we are cycling that right now this year. So yes, I feel very strong that we can continue to grow both sides. \nPaul Trussell: And this year, you're opening up maybe 600 stores and remodeling like 1,250 Family Dollars or so. Is that, in your mind, kind of a good go-forward run rate? Or do you see a scenario where you guys may actually want to accelerate in the future given the different formats and opportunities that you have? And just any updates on long-term store count potential? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. I'll comment on it and then flip over to Kevin to add. But from my perspective, we will absolutely -- we're going to continue -- we have 1,250 renovations this year. Next year, we believe there's going to be another 1,250. But then the great thing about our balance sheet, our capital structure, it enables to feed the growth as -- and accelerate the growth. So as we wind down the renovations after -- we'll have about this year and next year, then we can shift to total store growth. And then we've got these formats ahead of us that we feel very confident in growing. So yes, I would see the -- an acceleration in new store growth as we wound up or ramp up our 1,250 renovations for the next 2 years, then we'll shift to new store growth. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. Paul, I think to your point, total number of stores, I know the -- I think the most recent numbers we've given is Dollar Tree, about 10,000 stores and Family Dollar, roughly 15,000 stores. And again, I think we haven't updated those recently to the Street. It's something that we're looking at. I think part of what plays into that and will be something we can maybe update in the future is the idea that as stores continue to evolve, it changes the way we think about what that potential is, right. So as we talk today about the new combo store, we have to relook at the marketplaces. And as we've said, we think that's 3,000 stores at a minimum at this point in time. And so at some point in the future, we would update that.\n But it's a great opportunity. To Mike's point, the balance sheet helps support us in all things growing. And we're in a great place where obviously there are some retail space being vacated. That second-hand space has always been a big opportunity for us. And so that's another opportunity that allows us to grow at a good clip going forward. \nOperator: Looks like we have a question on the line from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: Mike, why don't we start with sort of strategic impact for the combo, right? So one, do you think it allows you, given the margin mix, to get sharper if you need to on Family Dollar pricing, number one. And then secondly, can you take learnings from the combo and put them into nonrural stores that may not overlap with Dollar Tree? Or are you pretty sensitive to that? \nMichael Witynski: Like I said, we're continuing to learn and refine on all our formats and do whatever it makes sense to get the most productive and improve our margins and profitability of the banners that we have. What I'm really excited about is -- on this format is that these are small towns that we would not go into the town with a Dollar Tree because the economics just don't support that. And we would go in with a Family Dollar and what we said is, well, let's go in with the great part of Dollar Tree and bring in the seasonal and the party and the stationery and the Crafter's Square and all the things that small-town America needs to celebrate their lives. And then on the Family Dollar side, it helps them live their lives and feed their families. So this Combination Store is really hitting on all cylinders from us because of the great mix and the great margin that provides and the overall productivity of the store.\n And to your earlier comment, we will continue to look at the categories that do well. And don't forget that in our H2s, we already have about 20 categories that have the $1 items that we brought into those categories from the Dollar Tree banner that really helped bring that value program into those stores and are helping drive the H2 format as well. So we will continue to look at that, John. \nJohn Heinbockel: And then maybe one follow-up to that, right, because I know you sourced that product. What's the thought now, right, on the supply chain? And does this push the idea of hybrid DCs versus the one you now have? Does that accelerate that process? \nMichael Witynski: Well, we will always -- we are absolutely in a parallel path. To your point, we've got a great DC network, and we are evolving that with trying to decide which -- what kind of format in our DC we're -- we have a lot of trucks going by all these towns. So we're going to leverage stem miles and leverage our distribution network to make sure we're driving the most efficiencies as we feed these formats across the country. But you're right, that would lend well to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar product riding on the same truck to drive those efficiencies. \nOperator: And we'll take another question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. So Mike, at the Dollar Tree banner, fourth quarter, low single-digit comps overall, basically matched the concept's historical run rate, despite I know there was some volatility in there with December and January. So as we think about the first quarter relative to the 2% to 3% comp in the fourth quarter, I guess, overall, any puts and takes to consider? And similarly, for the full year, is any impediments to driving low single-digit comps in your view for the year at Dollar Tree? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Overall, we don't see any structural or counter impediments. I -- last year, at Dollar Tree, Easter, as you know, did not happen just because it was at the peak of the beginning of COVID. And it did 2 things. It really impacted our first quarter sales at Dollar Tree and our margin at Dollar Tree because we didn't sell the high-margin Easter goods.\n And then as you look throughout the year, I believe that as the country opens up and people get back to their routines and occasions start to begin to increase inside the churches and schools and families and weddings and all those things that are great for Family Dollar business, I see some upside throughout the year. And then as you just heard, at Christmas, the 10 days or 2 weeks leading to Christmas, because of COVID, completely shut down in traffic. So yes, I believe there's upside this year for Dollar Tree. \nMatthew Boss: That's great. And then just a follow-up on gross margin at the Dollar Tree banner. I guess when we put together the anniversary of the first quarter headwind, I think you were down 250 basis points plus, and then we consider the freight headwind that you walked through, how should we think about Dollar Tree banner gross margin this year versus that 35% to 36% target range? \nKevin Wampler: Yes. I think a lot of puts and takes, as always, Matt. And I think, yes, as we've stated the last couple of quarters that we believe we can return to that 35- to 36-point range.\n I think the one development that probably hinders that a little bit here as we go into 2021 is change in freight that is really a pretty new item to the -- size of that, I guess, is where I will speak to. So again, I think overall, I think there are things that -- I think our mix continues to be good. I think markdown will continue to be good. I think, obviously, freight will be the big bad guy there. I think shrink could be helpful. And I think after a couple of years of distribution costs rising, I think that maybe that could flatten out just a little bit.\n So there's many, many puts and takes, but I don't necessarily see it's getting back to that above 35% in 2021 right now with the freight headwind. That doesn't mean we can't get there, but it's a little bit of an uphill climb. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Matt, this is Mike. What Kevin said is -- what I'm encouraged about is we just finished our January trip, which is our largest trip that we buy for the back half of the year. And our buyers did it remotely, but the value of the product, the excitement of the new product coming in for the back half of the year and the initial markup we're seeing on that product is exactly ahead our expectation.\n And then as Kevin said, there's going to be some headwinds, but we'll figure out how to manage that. Just like we did with tariffs, as long as they're ahead of us and we know what it is, we will manage around that. And our mix is going to be favorable, too, at Dollar Tree as we -- the Crafter's Square and as we grow the discretionary side of the business this year, as the country begins to open up, that's the side that will benefit the most from this. And that's why I'm really excited about it.\n As the shrink -- as you know, the last 3 years, shrink has been a headwind at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And last year, we improved it, but we see some continued improvement as that -- in that area as well to help offset some other pressures. \nMatthew Boss: That's great color. So interpretation is just under 35% this year, but you have visibility, given the sourcing trips and the IMU, that you're seeing to be back in that 35% to 36%, just given the lead times and as the freight dissipates. Is that kind of the best way to think about it? \nKevin Wampler: I guess the way to think about it, Matt, I think we've tried to describe the puts and takes the best we can at this point in time. It's obviously very fluid, and we'll continue to update you on -- we've tried to be very transparent this morning on all of these items affecting us, and we'll update you as we go forward. \nOperator: And it looks like we have time for one more question from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So can you frame out the math a little bit that you provided? That was very helpful. So $279 million of COVID costs are going to roll off. You'll have $100 million that are going to be ongoing from the $25 million run rate that you provided for the fourth quarter. So that's a net $179 million benefit at the midpoint of the incremental pressure you're feeling from wages and freight, that $137.5 million. So all else equal, nothing else happens, your sales are flat, you should have $41 million of additional operating income simply from a mix of those 2 factors. And as part of that, can we then just kind of model out how we think sales are going to be and operating income would grow with sales, putting aside that other math? \nKevin Wampler: Well, I mean, obviously, the puts and the takes that you talked to there, Michael, those are the numbers. And again, those are the big ones. There's obviously many things that happen in any given year. We're not giving specific guidance. I think I've helped as much as I can this morning in every way possible.\n But again, I think you're right. The big items, I think -- we think we can offset. Again, there's plenty of other puts and takes at the end of the day. But we feel relative -- we feel good about our business. We feel good about where we're going to be in 2021 and the opportunities ahead of us. And I don't know that I can give you a whole lot more guidance beyond that. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. I literally just got several messages that, I guess, to make a counterargument to that math, which is all of that's true except for Family Dollar is going to be down potentially in the year ahead and will have to lap some unique benefits. So can you put any frame or reference around how we should think about -- what was unique to Family Dollar in 2019 that's really just not going to repeat? I know that's a big point of uncertainty, but that seems to be where it lies right now. And then I have one last follow-up on Dollar Tree Plus!. \nKevin Wampler: I mean Family Dollar, I mean, you heard us talk this morning about our initiatives. You heard us talk about the opportunities that we have with the H2 and the combo stores. You've heard us talk about how we believe we are truly making a difference in building out our discretionary business and that it's a big -- it's not just big for sales, it's big for margin. It's big for customer satisfaction, return trips and all the things that go with that. So I think those are the things that we're working on hard day in and day out.\n I don't think anybody can truly project stimulus, how fast the economy will bounce back and all those things that are going to go into it at the end of the day. So we feel good about where we're at. That's where we stand today. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Mike, well, I just want to reiterate the enthusiasm I have for both banners and where we're at with our formats, with the strategy that our merchants are working on was cycling last year's pandemic. And again, our capital structure, we are in the best position we've been in, in 5 years, and we've got a bright future. And our merchants are going to continue to do the things they do every day and get better, and we're going to keep growing the company. \nMichael Lasser: Yes. And these reasons, very clear from the messaging you're providing. So that's helpful. And then my last follow-up is on the Dollar Tree Plus! concept. You stated that it's exceeding your plan. What's holding you back from rolling this out faster than the 500 locations that you're currently in the process of deploying to? And how does the overall financial performance of the Dollar Tree stores look in terms of sales, operating income dollars and margin? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. And again, we're going to -- that's why we're rolling it out to another 500, it's to continue this test. We had 120 stores, and we bought seasonal items and items for the back half of the year, and we exceeded the sales that we expected. So our customers are responding favorably. And what I've shared in the past is we will continue to look at the overall store sales, the overall margin and the profitability of those stores. And those, we want to see improve.\n And the tough thing is, with everything going on last year, with everything I just described with COVID, it was really hard to lift our head up and say, did the 10% of the store in the DT Plus! really drive those things that I just described. So we're going to keep testing and refining and rolling this out, but we like the results we're seeing so far. \nOperator: All right. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Randy Guiler, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. \nRandy Guiler: Okay. Thank you, Jordan, and thank you for joining us for today's call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Our next earnings conference call to discuss Q1 results is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, May 27, 2021. Thank you, and have a good day. \nOperator: And this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Wampler",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning. For the fourth quarter, consolidated net sales increased 7.2% to $6.77 billion, comprised of $3.71 billion of Dollar Tree and $3.06 billion of Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.9% or 5% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations. Comps for Family Dollar increased 8.1% and Dollar Tree segment increased 2.4%.  \n Overall, gross profit for the enterprise increased 9.8% to $2.15 billion, and gross margin improved 80 basis points to 31.8%. The gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 10 basis points to 36.1% when compared to the prior year's quarter. The factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance include distribution costs increased 40 basis points primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. This includes the continued ramp-up of the 2 new distribution centers as well as $4.4 million or 10 basis points of COVID-related expenses primarily premium pay and bonuses. These higher DC costs as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by a 20 basis point improvement in markdowns and a 5 basis point improvement in shrink. Merchandise costs, including freight, also improved 5 basis points. Improvements in merchandise mix and markdown were mostly offset by increased freight costs.\n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 200 basis points to 26.6% in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: markdown expense improved 100 basis points due to lower promotional activity and improved sell-through of seasonal merchandise and apparel; occupancy costs decreased approximately 50 basis points from leverage on the 8.1% comp sales increase; shrink improved 35 basis points on improved inventory results; distribution costs improved approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year quarter; the current year quarter included approximately $3.2 million or 10 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium paying bonuses; and regarding merchandise costs, including freight, improvements in merchandise mix and markdown were essentially offset by increased freight costs during the quarter.\n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 540 basis points to 21.7% of net sales compared to 27.1% in Q4 a year ago. The prior year's quarter included a $313 million noncash pretax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge, an $18 million charge to the litigation reserve. Excluding these items from the prior year's quarter, SG&A expenses improved 20 basis points from an adjusted 21.9% of net sales.\n For the fourth quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales improved slightly to 20.1% of net sales when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved approximately 30 basis points and is comprised of the following: payroll expenses increased approximately $7.2 million or 20 basis points for costs associated with COVID-19-related payroll and bonuses. Additionally, increased incentive compensation was partially offset by lower health insurance benefits.\n Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 20 basis points primarily from reduced travel and lower legal and professional fees. The depreciation cost decreased 10 basis points. Excluding goodwill impairment and litigation reserve charges from the prior year's quarter, the SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 80 basis points to 20.6% compared to an adjusted 21.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019.\n Depreciation improved 30 basis points, primarily from leverage on strong comp sales increase. Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 30 basis points primarily due to lower advertising and travel costs as a percentage of net sales. Payroll-related expenses improved approximately 15 basis points, and store facility costs improved approximately 5 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales and lower electricity costs. Corporate and support expenses increased 20 basis points primarily related to higher incentive comp and stock compensation expense compared to the prior year's quarter.\n Operating income improved 173% to $681.6 million compared with $249.4 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 10.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 3.9% in the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $313 million goodwill impairment and $18 million litigation reserve from the prior year's quarter, operating income margin improved 90 basis points from the adjusted 9.2%.\n Q4 of 2020 included total incremental operating costs of $24.8 million for COVID-19-related expenses. These incremental costs by segment were $13.8 million for Dollar Tree, $10.6 million for Family Dollar and $0.4 million for Corporate, Support and Other. Nonoperating expenses totaled $34.2 million, comprised of net interest expense.\n Our effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 41.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The prior year rate was affected by the noncash goodwill impairment charge that was not tax deductible. Without the goodwill impairment charge, the tax rate was -- for Q4 2019 would have been 16.6%, which included a reduction in tax expense of $24.6 million for the reversal of our valuation allowance related to the company's foreign net operating loss carryforwards.\n Company net income of $502.8 million or $2.13 per diluted share, which included $0.08 per diluted share for COVID-19-related expenses. This compares to a net earnings of $123 million or $0.52 per share in the prior year's quarter and an adjusted earnings per share of $1.79.\n Combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $1.42 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. The company paid off the $300 million legacy Family Dollar note during the quarter. Outstanding debt as of January 30, 2021, was $3.25 billion.\n During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.83 million shares for $200 million. With the Board action announced this morning, we now have $2.4 billion authorized for share repurchases. We will continue to invest in our business and will provide postquarter updates on share repurchase activity.\n Inventory for Dollar Tree at year-end declined 5.9% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 3.7%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 9.2%. Inventory for Family Dollar at year-end increased 0.5% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 1.8%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 11.3%. Our inventory levels improved in Q4 and will continue to be more productive with lower inventory, significantly increasing our inventory turns.\n Capital expenditures were $191.8 million in the fourth quarter versus $252.5 million in Q4 last year. For fiscal 2021, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures will be focused on 600 new stores and 1,250 Family Dollar H2 renovations. The new stores will be 400 Dollar Tree stores and 200 Family Dollar stores, including both H2 and combo stores, formats, based on market locations. The addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to select Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores, IT system enhancements and projects, development of our Chesapeake campus, installation of LED lighting and HVAC and flooring replacements in select stores and the ongoing construction for the second phase of our new distribution center in Ocala, Florida.\n Depreciation and amortization totaled $182.9 million for Q4 compared to $179.1 million in the fourth quarter last year. And for the year, depreciation expense totaled $686.6 million. For fiscal 2021, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $720 million to $730 million.\n Due to a number of variables and uncertainties, we're not providing specific sales and EPS guidance. These variables include unknowns related to the COVID pandemic and its impact to customer shopping patterns, timing and magnitude of government stimulus and potential for the timing of changes with federal minimum wage.\n I do want to share some points to assist your modeling for 2021. The February storms have brought snow and freezing temperatures through Texas and much of the central part of the states, resulting in more than 5,500 lost store days for closures of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores in the areas most impacted. Stores are now back open and operating, but Q1 sales will be impacted from these closures.\n We will be cycling the 2020 onset of the COVID pandemic in 20 -- in Q1. Our business segments were impacted in different ways a year ago. At Dollar Tree, both sales and gross margin were negatively impacted by losing discretionary Easter-related seasonal sales. As a result, in Q1 of 2020, the Dollar Tree segment had a 0.9% comp decrease and a 31.9% gross margin. At Family Dollar, for Q1, we'll be cycling a 15.5% comp increase in the prior year, which will be our toughest quarterly compare for 2021.\n We face headwinds for minimum wage and freight costs in 2021. The minimum wage has increased in certain states and localities and may increase nationally depending on the outcome of future legislation. The currently scheduled minimum wage increases are estimated to increase store payroll by $45 million to $50 million in 2021.\n We're experiencing some delays in receiving import merchandise as a result of worldwide equipment shortages and issues with port congestion. As a result of current market conditions, we're seeing significant increases in cost of import freight and moderate pressure on domestic freight. We currently project $80 million to $100 million of additional costs in fiscal 2021 as a result of these market conditions. These costs primarily affect the first 3 quarters of the year as currently projected.\n We believe these headwinds will be more than offset by productivity and cost savings initiatives, such as Crafter's Square, H2 and combo stores, continued focus in shrink and reduced COVID-related costs.\n We incurred COVID-related costs of $279 million in 2020 to support our associates, stores and customers. We will continue to incur costs for COVID activities in 2021 but, we believe, at a materially reduced level.\n We've got tailwinds as well. COVID relief checks are anticipated to provide a significant lift. We also expect that the COVID -- the base customer traffic could return to more normalized levels.\n Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q1, approximately $135 million for fiscal 2021. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.5% for the first quarter and 23.2% for fiscal 2021.\n Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 234.5 million shares for Q1 and 234.8 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. But as noted, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $2.4 billion.\n Over the past several years, the company has reduced its debt from the acquisition by over $5 billion, returning to a solid investment-grade rating. With our strong flexible balance sheet, we'll be able to increase store growth and return to share repurchases as an important part of capital allocation going forward. We'd expect to complete the $2.4 billion share repurchase authorization over the next 2 years or so.\n And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. Sure, Kelly. It's Kevin. Yes. So we wanted to give some color, obviously, as to what's going on. Obviously, not giving specific guidance given the many variables that are out there right now. The $45 million to $50 million that we spoke to in regards to payroll is very specific. Our operations, labor department looks at that by state. We know there's approximately 30 states affected this year. We know our labor pool in those states. We know how many hourly people we have, and we go through a calculation on that.\n Now that's no different than any other year. This is just really the first time we've given you a number as to what it relates to. We have done -- we have faced these same type of increases over the last couple of years. But this time, we were just trying to put some graphics around it to help people understand the size of that.\n As it relates the freight costs, again, our current projection is roughly $80 million to $100 million, really fairly comparable across both banners. It is much more import related than domestic related so it's been probably 75-25, 80-20 as far as import related at this point in time. And that is just based upon current market conditions that we currently face. As many of you know, we go to market with our freight contract or import freight contracts in the spring here. These are negotiated in March and April and -- to go live then in May. So really, a lot has been talked about in the marketplace in general. So I don't think there should be a lot of surprise around it. And again, we're just trying to give an idea of the size of that.\n And then obviously, if we look at the offsets, so obviously, COVID costs in and of themselves last year as we talked about were $279 million. If we -- even if we said we spent at the same rate we did in Q4, which is roughly $25 million, we'll spend, obviously, significantly less going into the new year. So I'll let you guys do the math on that at the end of the day, but those are the puts and takes.\n And obviously, it goes beyond that. Obviously, driving sales -- I think we obviously talked this morning about how we'll continue to drive sales. But also there's other items. When you look at shrink as a potential good item after maybe a second year in a row after having an upswing a couple of years prior to that. So some good progress being made there. We're still not where we think we can get to, but really proud of the teams, the operations teams and the asset protection teams that have been working hard to mitigate the issue that we've faced there. Yes. So right now, the stores are about 10,500 square feet. So they're slightly bigger than what a normal Dollar Tree would be. And the -- we like the economics. Our sales are exceeding utilized share -- the comp sales are 20% or greater on average. And when we're going into a new market, they're performing better than our expectation of when it was just a Family Dollar as a stand-alone store.\n And you can imagine the margins are enhanced because now you've got the mix of Dollar Tree product in there at $1 price point and in the categories that normally are higher margins. And you're leveraging it with 1 store manager and 1 store team and delivering 2 brands to a customer and to a small town. And we like the results. Sure, Joe. As you look at it, we contract for a certain volume of containers. It's been a big year from an import standpoint, obviously. And so at some point, if you exceed your volume, you do pay more potentially based upon on the marketplace. The spot market, and you guys see all the same information we see, has been up significantly in general. And again, then a part of it is supply and demand. There is a backup in China, in Asia. And to get goods move in some instances, people are paying more. And it's not just us. You've heard other retailers over the last 2 weeks speak to it as well. So it's not a Dollar Tree-specific issue. It's an industry issue.\n And our team is working through that and moving our goods. We've been able to keep our seasonal goods coming in, and feel good about that. But in general, based on where the marketplace is projected to be, that is our best projection as we sit here today. Well, Joe, I think as we think about it, I mean, we obviously always think there's opportunity in both. Even if we've made a big leap this year with the Family Dollar operating income going in the right direction, it's still not where we want it to be ultimately. We've made big strides. And we do believe, obviously, as we began 2020, we spoke a lot about discretionary business and building that side of the house and us being a more important player in building that kind of muscle. And obviously, the pandemic helped with that, but we do believe that we've made strides. And again, I think Mike, in his comments, talked about the fact that are just -- we're growing twice the market in that piece of business. So that's a great opportunity to continue to go.\n But that doesn't mean we don't think there's other opportunities as well. You look at the -- as we talk about the combo store, we think that's a great opportunity. We believe there's, at a minimum, 3,000 locations out there where we can play an important role in our customers' lives on a day-to-day basis and be their place to shop for many, many things. They may not live close to a large metropolitan area. And so it's a big opportunity as we think about it. So a lot of opportunity there.\n I think on the Dollar Tree side, I think, again, we always believe there's opportunity. And Dollar Tree has evolved over the years, as you well know, in the sense of we always reinvent ourselves. Most recently, we've talked about Snack Zone. We've talked about our Crafter's Square initiative. And again, some of these initiatives are traffic driving. Some of these are really margin driving and -- but it's always relevant to the consumer, and the $1 fixed price point does not go out of style. People love the value it provides. And now we can add upon that, obviously, taking the Dollar Tree Plus! opportunity, expanding into 500 stores, continuing to learn and build upon that and really be able to take that and benefit both banners by taking that $3 and $5 product. Yes. Paul, this is Kevin. I'll start, and I'll let Mike chime in if he has anything. But I guess, I think about it in a couple of ways. One, one of the words you guys have all heard me use before, and I think it's very true within our company, is continuous improvement. We go into every year expecting to improve in all aspects of our business, and whether that's driving sales, reducing costs, being a more efficient company. And so that's just the way our mindset is. And so while I don't know that I have a timetable to give you in a sense of certain milestones, as I sit here today, and again, part of that is, obviously, the uncertainty of what's going on out there in the world with the pandemic. And -- but we would expect continuous improvement. And I think Mike has shared a lot of that with all of you this morning and the idea.\n So we entered the year. The expectation is we're going to improve our operating income for both banners when we think about it. Whether we can do it with some of the things going on in the world, that's yet to be seen. But there's a great opportunity. And I think that's the most important thing, is the way we always want to improve. Yes. Paul, I think to your point, total number of stores, I know the -- I think the most recent numbers we've given is Dollar Tree, about 10,000 stores and Family Dollar, roughly 15,000 stores. And again, I think we haven't updated those recently to the Street. It's something that we're looking at. I think part of what plays into that and will be something we can maybe update in the future is the idea that as stores continue to evolve, it changes the way we think about what that potential is, right. So as we talk today about the new combo store, we have to relook at the marketplaces. And as we've said, we think that's 3,000 stores at a minimum at this point in time. And so at some point in the future, we would update that.\n But it's a great opportunity. To Mike's point, the balance sheet helps support us in all things growing. And we're in a great place where obviously there are some retail space being vacated. That second-hand space has always been a big opportunity for us. And so that's another opportunity that allows us to grow at a good clip going forward. Yes. I think a lot of puts and takes, as always, Matt. And I think, yes, as we've stated the last couple of quarters that we believe we can return to that 35- to 36-point range.\n I think the one development that probably hinders that a little bit here as we go into 2021 is change in freight that is really a pretty new item to the -- size of that, I guess, is where I will speak to. So again, I think overall, I think there are things that -- I think our mix continues to be good. I think markdown will continue to be good. I think, obviously, freight will be the big bad guy there. I think shrink could be helpful. And I think after a couple of years of distribution costs rising, I think that maybe that could flatten out just a little bit.\n So there's many, many puts and takes, but I don't necessarily see it's getting back to that above 35% in 2021 right now with the freight headwind. That doesn't mean we can't get there, but it's a little bit of an uphill climb. I guess the way to think about it, Matt, I think we've tried to describe the puts and takes the best we can at this point in time. It's obviously very fluid, and we'll continue to update you on -- we've tried to be very transparent this morning on all of these items affecting us, and we'll update you as we go forward. Well, I mean, obviously, the puts and the takes that you talked to there, Michael, those are the numbers. And again, those are the big ones. There's obviously many things that happen in any given year. We're not giving specific guidance. I think I've helped as much as I can this morning in every way possible.\n But again, I think you're right. The big items, I think -- we think we can offset. Again, there's plenty of other puts and takes at the end of the day. But we feel relative -- we feel good about our business. We feel good about where we're going to be in 2021 and the opportunities ahead of us. And I don't know that I can give you a whole lot more guidance beyond that. I mean Family Dollar, I mean, you heard us talk this morning about our initiatives. You heard us talk about the opportunities that we have with the H2 and the combo stores. You've heard us talk about how we believe we are truly making a difference in building out our discretionary business and that it's a big -- it's not just big for sales, it's big for margin. It's big for customer satisfaction, return trips and all the things that go with that. So I think those are the things that we're working on hard day in and day out.\n I don't think anybody can truly project stimulus, how fast the economy will bounce back and all those things that are going to go into it at the end of the day. So we feel good about where we're at. That's where we stand today."

            "name": "Michael Witynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining me today. What a year. I believe that from now -- that years from now, many of us will reflect upon 2020 as being one of the most unique, unpredictable and challenging business environments of our career. My sincerest gratitude goes out to our 195,000 plus associates working in more than 15,600 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores and in 26 distribution centers and to our field leadership teams as well as our store support team here in Chesapeake, Virginia. Your commitment and dedication to protect and serve our customers is critical to our company's success. As an essential retailer in the value segment, we will continue to be part of the solution for millions of households across North America.\n Additionally, I would like to recognize our business partners, both supply chain and suppliers, for their efforts to support our business throughout the year. In 2020, we exceeded $25 billion in annual sales for the first time, and we have a long runway of growth ahead of us. As our business grows, so does the need and support from each of our business partners. We appreciate your continued support.\n The recent trends have been encouraging. COVID cases are on the decline, and vaccinations are on the rise. However, we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to protect each other until this pandemic is behind us.\n I am very pleased with the team's operating performance for the fourth quarter, highlighted by solid same-store sales increase, improved gross margin and expense leverage. The team delivered EPS increase of 310% compared to the prior year's quarters or 19% when adjusted for discrete charges in the prior year. Our results included a 4.9% enterprise comp increase, an 80 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 90 base increase in operating profit margin when compared to the prior year's adjusted numbers.\n Our Dollar Tree segment delivered another quarter of positive same-store sales with a 2.4% increase. January was the strongest month of the quarter, followed by November. In fact, January was our strongest monthly comp since April of 2019. December was slightly negative as store traffic was impacted by an escalation in COVID cases, resulting in expanded lockdowns and significantly fewer holiday social gatherings among families, companies, churches and schools. As we have seen in the onset of the pandemic, sales were again driven by average ticket, which increased 17.9% as shoppers continue to consolidate trips. Comp transaction count declined 13.1%. \n We delivered a 36.1% gross margin, and Dollar Tree's operating margin, which included $13.8 million in COVID-related costs, came in at 16% operating income. Categories performing well included crafts, seasonal, household products, floral, kitchenware and beauty and eyewear. Building on the continued success of craft assortment, we completed the rollout of Crafter's Square to all U.S. Dollar Tree stores in January. Inspiring the creativity of our customers is at the core of Dollar Tree, and we are thrilled to provide an even broader assortment of art and crafts supplies at tremendous values. With our $1 fixed price point and more than 7,500 U.S. store locations, Crafter's Square presents customers with an unlimited solutions for current learn-from-home and work-from-home environment.\n Additionally, terrific opportunity exist for DIY home projects and decor, crafts for the entire family, seasonal decorations and handmade gifts. Our shoppers love the expanded assortment, which is validated by the excitement Crafter's Square is generating across social media platforms, including YouTube and Instagram.\n Regarding our Dollar Tree Plus!, our shoppers love the values, and we exceeded our initial sales plan for the fourth quarter. We had great sell-through on our seasonal products, on our toys and household consumables. We are on schedule to kick off the previously announced expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! this month. We are expanding multi-price assortment from the current base of 120 stores to a total of 500 stores and will be completed by August. Additionally, we are capturing great buying synergies as the majority of the $3 and $5 merchandise for the DT Plus! will be offered in both banners.\n Family Dollar sales highlights for the quarter included an 8.1% comp increase, comprised of a 21.9% expansion in average ticket, partially offset by 11.3% decline in transaction count. This is similar to the ticket traffic trip consolidation dynamic we have seen since Q1 of 2020.\n Regarding the cadence of comps, all 3 months were positive, with January being the strongest month. As a reminder, all Family Dollar stores were closed on Christmas Day in 2020, which has impacted December comp results as approximately 5,600 stores were open for business the previous year.\n January was Family Dollar's strongest monthly comp since May of last year. We saw solid sales across many of the discretionary categories that we have been focused on improving, including home decor, apparel, household cleaning, lawn and garden, party, beauty care and seasonal.\n The consumables side of the business delivered another positive quarterly comp at 6.2%, and the discretionary comp was a strong 13.5% comp. In Q4, discretionary as a percent of net sales at Family Dollar increased 120 basis points to 26.2% of sales. Similar to recent quarters, based on third-party data, our market share in discretionary grew 2x faster than the remaining market in Q4. Late in 2020, we launched our initial test for produce and frozen needs at select Family Dollar stores, targeting markets where shoppers have fewer local grocery options. We want to provide shoppers with convenient access to basic produce items as well as beef, poultry and pork. We plan to expand our test in 2021.\n We recently announced the expansion of our new partnership with Instacart platform across the U.S. Same-day delivery is another example of meeting the evolving needs of Family Dollar shoppers. The initial results have exceeded our expectations, and we continue to receive very positive feedback from shoppers. These transactions have materially higher average ticket, and we believe the Instacart platform is enabling us to broaden our dollar -- our Family Dollar customer base. Interestingly, in the first 3 weeks of the national rollout, more than 80% of Family Dollar stores had 1 or more Instacart transactions.\n As always, our most important scorecards come from our shoppers. We are seeing considerable improvements in our customer satisfaction survey scores. For Q4, we saw record numbers across each of the 4 key categories: store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. In fact, each of these categories have shown improvement for 3 consecutive quarters. Contributors to these -- this success is an enhanced Family Dollar brand strategy program that clearly conveys expectations and examples to our store teams. And the chains' annual store manager turnover are at the best in over a decade. The improved customer satisfaction results gives us confidence that we will be able to retain shoppers that discovered or reengage with Family Dollar during the pandemic.\n Regarding Dollar Tree Canada, the team delivered another solid quarter, exceeding its plan for sales, gross margin and operating income. From a real estate perspective, we completed more than 280 projects, including 124 new stores, 11 relocations, 106 Family Dollar renovations and 45 store closings. We ended the year with 15,685 stores.\n We accomplished a great deal in 2020. Much of this was made possible by our 2019 initiatives that really set the stage to gain traction and momentum in 2020 and beyond. To quickly recap, in 2019, we consolidated our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar store support centers into 1 campus, greatly improving efficiencies through enhanced communication, collaboration and support. We made tremendous progress on Family Dollar store optimization initiatives by rebannering 200 stores, closing more than 400 stores and doubling the pace of our renovation program to more than 1,000 per year.\n We also launched our initial test for Dollar Tree Plus!, and we realigned our leadership team to enhance and align the consistency of communication, strategies, process and workflows. For example, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar merchants went through 2020 in complete unison for buying calendars, buying trip meetings, planning dates and category performance reviews. This strength in alignment was very evident in the success of our recent virtual buying trip in January, which is our biggest buying trip of the year. These initiatives help build the foundation for 2020 performance.\n The progress we have made at Family Dollar in the past despite the pandemic has been remarkable. We are benefiting from improved store conditions and better execution on initiatives, resulting in market share gains. We have also seen improved customer satisfaction scores, store turnover and shrink improvements. I am convinced that Family Dollar will exit the pandemic as a much stronger organization. This progress is why I'm more enthusiastic about the opportunities in 2021 and beyond, including the expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! and the growth of our new Combination Stores into small towns across America.\n I will go into more detail on our plans for 2021 after Kevin speaks to the Q4 performance and our outlook. Kevin? Thanks, Kevin. Again, I'm extremely proud of the team's efforts for fiscal 2020. For the year, our customer satisfaction scores are improving, and we are experiencing our lowest store manager turnover rates in many years.\n The team delivered an enterprise comp increase of 6.1%. Gross profit increased by more than $740 million, a 70 basis point improvement. We delivered our SG&A costs, which were flat year-over-year, as a percent of net sales despite incurring $279 million or 110 basis points in COVID-related costs.\n Enterprise operating profit margin improved 70 basis points to 7.4%. The company repurchased 400 million shares and ended the year with more than $1.4 billion in cash on the balance sheet. And we delivered annual diluted EPS of $5.65.\n This morning, we announced our newest and tested concept that is working remarkably well in rural markets. What we refer to is our combination or combo store format. As I have said in the past, we will continue to refine strategic store formats designed to serve more customers in all types of geographic markets while improving store productivity, margins and returns. The Combination Store leverages both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve small towns across the country. The store combines Family Dollar's great value and assortment with Dollar Tree's thrill of the hunt and $1 price point, creating a new format targeted for populations ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 people. These are markets where we traditionally do not open a Dollar Tree store alone.\n We opened the first test Combination Store in late 2019, followed by 2 additional test stores in early 2020. Closely analyzing the store performance and customer feedback and utilizing learnings, we refined the concept. Between July 2020 and calendar year-end, we opened or renovated 32 additional stores. And currently, we have nearly 50 new stores in small towns like Linden, Alabama, Hogansville, Georgia, Bovina, New York and dozens of others. Compared to other small market Family Dollar stores, these Combination Stores are delivering same-store sales lift of greater than 20% on average. Combination Stores are more productive, delivering higher gross margins and are better leveraging store costs. Our successful H2 stores and Combination Stores will both be part of the Family Dollar and new store and renovation strategy moving forward.\n We are extremely pleased with our customers' response to the new Combination Store concept. Our goal is to have formats that leverage the best of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve customers in all types of geographic markets. We believe we can continue to change, evolve and improve.\n To really share why we are very excited to introduce this new format, we are providing a 3-minute video, along with photos, introducing the new Combination Stores at FamilyDollar.com/ComboStores. Please go check it out.\n Our teams worked incredibly hard throughout fiscal 2020. I could not be more proud of our team's commitment, dedication and focus. We believe our proven strategic store formats and accelerated store growth plan, 1,250 planned store renovations for the year, several key sales and traffic-driven initiatives, along with a robust balance sheet, will enable us to deliver long-term value for each of our stakeholders, our customers, associates, suppliers and shareholders.\n Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Yes. Joe, this is Mike. I agree with Kevin. I am so excited about 2021. And I absolutely believe there's growth for both banners. And Kevin hit on them. I'll start with Family Dollar. We are absolutely going to come out stronger on the backside of the pandemic than on the front side for a lot of reasons. And I think about what Kevin was speaking to on March 4 of last year, our comp sales in consumables were strong low single-digit quarter after quarter. And where we needed to focus our energy was on our discretionary side. And it was a year ago in December that Rick McNeely was assigned to be the lead merchant for both banners and really leverage synergies where possible and bring disciplines and capabilities to the Family Dollar team.\n So during this pandemic, we didn't just survive through it. We thrived through it and changed our disciplines and strategies. And we looked at -- in our merchandising, we looked at our basic assortment of what we're carrying by sharper price points. We got better values. And we're not going to go back to the old way. We're going to improve upon that. And the pandemic really accelerated our inventory from the past and really flushed that through last year. And then our new receipts coming in on all the disciplines that I just got done describing are really selling it at a great mix, stronger sell-throughs, less markdowns and better turns.\n The second thing is our stores. You heard us talk about our customer satisfaction scores across the board for 3 quarters are improving. We've invested a lot in getting better initiatives and execution in our stores, and our customers are responding. And we'll have that carrying forward compared to going into the pandemic.\n The fourth thing, as Kevin said, is we've got clear direction now on a format strategy. We've got H2 format that is continuing to produce 10% comps when we go in and renovate them, and we're going to renovate another 1,250 of them this year. And then this wonderful new store of a combo store in small towns that is producing a 20% comp, and so another thing that we didn't have prior to last year going into the pandemic.\n And then our balance sheet as Kevin spoke about. We generate a lot of cash flow. And we've got $1.4 billion on our balance sheet, and that enables us to be very flexible and grow this company like we haven't grown before because we don't have to pay $1 billion to $1.2 billion every year to pay down the debt. We can use it flexible to grow this company and grow shareholder value.\n And then the last thing I would say on Family Dollar's side is -- and we haven't even been in the digital and omnichannel business. And you heard us just now dipping our toes into Instagram and we're -- or Instacart. And the Instacart is just getting a huge response for our customers and it give us a broader -- able to serve a broader segment of this customer with Instacart. So there's another upside with our digital and omnichannel.\n And then you've heard us about Dollar Tree Plus!. We will always grow that business, and we'll find those categories. And now we have our Crafter's Square in all Dollar Tree -- we just got it done in January. We're going on a goal this entire year with Crafter's Square. And you've heard us talk about Dollar Tree Plus!. So we're going to drive that Dollar Tree Plus.\n And then Dollar Tree didn't perform that well because of those COVID related -- if you look at our fourth quarter, our November comps in Dollar Tree were spectacular, and our January was the best in 2 years. What happened was December lockdown, because of -- the COVID cases increased and spiked at the highest levels across the country. And you all saw that. And the states, because of that, increased the lockdowns. People did not go around. And what happens is there wasn't any celebrations. The Dollar Tree feeds those celebrations in the schools, in the churches, at-home/at-work parties, and all of our party categories flourish during the first 10 days before Christmas. And it just didn't happen because of COVID.\n Outside of that, we had a great quarter with 2.4% comp, which was better than the fourth quarter in 2019, and we had a COVID problem. So we delivered 36 plus margin and a 16% op income at Family Dollar, and I believe we can beat that next year. So yes, to answer your question, I believe we're going to have a successful year at both banners for those reasons. Yes. Paul, I agree with Kevin that we will continuously improve and drive our path on Family Dollar's side. As you've heard me, we have not arrived yet, and there is upside because we just cycled through our first year, and we are -- continue to look at our assortment, our allocations and improve upon the products that we have and price points.\n And I think on the Dollar Tree side, we have things ahead of us, just like the tariffs. Once we got it in front of us, we know how to manage around it. And I would say the short term, the freight thing, once we're aware of it, we're going to figure out how to mitigate it and grow the margins and grow Dollar Tree. Dollar Tree, for 14 years, has had a quarter-after-quarter of kind of positive comp store sales growth, except for first quarter last year, and here we are cycling that right now this year. So yes, I feel very strong that we can continue to grow both sides. Yes. I'll comment on it and then flip over to Kevin to add. But from my perspective, we will absolutely -- we're going to continue -- we have 1,250 renovations this year. Next year, we believe there's going to be another 1,250. But then the great thing about our balance sheet, our capital structure, it enables to feed the growth as -- and accelerate the growth. So as we wind down the renovations after -- we'll have about this year and next year, then we can shift to total store growth. And then we've got these formats ahead of us that we feel very confident in growing. So yes, I would see the -- an acceleration in new store growth as we wound up or ramp up our 1,250 renovations for the next 2 years, then we'll shift to new store growth. Like I said, we're continuing to learn and refine on all our formats and do whatever it makes sense to get the most productive and improve our margins and profitability of the banners that we have. What I'm really excited about is -- on this format is that these are small towns that we would not go into the town with a Dollar Tree because the economics just don't support that. And we would go in with a Family Dollar and what we said is, well, let's go in with the great part of Dollar Tree and bring in the seasonal and the party and the stationery and the Crafter's Square and all the things that small-town America needs to celebrate their lives. And then on the Family Dollar side, it helps them live their lives and feed their families. So this Combination Store is really hitting on all cylinders from us because of the great mix and the great margin that provides and the overall productivity of the store.\n And to your earlier comment, we will continue to look at the categories that do well. And don't forget that in our H2s, we already have about 20 categories that have the $1 items that we brought into those categories from the Dollar Tree banner that really helped bring that value program into those stores and are helping drive the H2 format as well. So we will continue to look at that, John. Well, we will always -- we are absolutely in a parallel path. To your point, we've got a great DC network, and we are evolving that with trying to decide which -- what kind of format in our DC we're -- we have a lot of trucks going by all these towns. So we're going to leverage stem miles and leverage our distribution network to make sure we're driving the most efficiencies as we feed these formats across the country. But you're right, that would lend well to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar product riding on the same truck to drive those efficiencies. Yes. Overall, we don't see any structural or counter impediments. I -- last year, at Dollar Tree, Easter, as you know, did not happen just because it was at the peak of the beginning of COVID. And it did 2 things. It really impacted our first quarter sales at Dollar Tree and our margin at Dollar Tree because we didn't sell the high-margin Easter goods.\n And then as you look throughout the year, I believe that as the country opens up and people get back to their routines and occasions start to begin to increase inside the churches and schools and families and weddings and all those things that are great for Family Dollar business, I see some upside throughout the year. And then as you just heard, at Christmas, the 10 days or 2 weeks leading to Christmas, because of COVID, completely shut down in traffic. So yes, I believe there's upside this year for Dollar Tree. Yes. Matt, this is Mike. What Kevin said is -- what I'm encouraged about is we just finished our January trip, which is our largest trip that we buy for the back half of the year. And our buyers did it remotely, but the value of the product, the excitement of the new product coming in for the back half of the year and the initial markup we're seeing on that product is exactly ahead our expectation.\n And then as Kevin said, there's going to be some headwinds, but we'll figure out how to manage that. Just like we did with tariffs, as long as they're ahead of us and we know what it is, we will manage around that. And our mix is going to be favorable, too, at Dollar Tree as we -- the Crafter's Square and as we grow the discretionary side of the business this year, as the country begins to open up, that's the side that will benefit the most from this. And that's why I'm really excited about it.\n As the shrink -- as you know, the last 3 years, shrink has been a headwind at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And last year, we improved it, but we see some continued improvement as that -- in that area as well to help offset some other pressures. Yes. Mike, well, I just want to reiterate the enthusiasm I have for both banners and where we're at with our formats, with the strategy that our merchants are working on was cycling last year's pandemic. And again, our capital structure, we are in the best position we've been in, in 5 years, and we've got a bright future. And our merchants are going to continue to do the things they do every day and get better, and we're going to keep growing the company. Yes. And again, we're going to -- that's why we're rolling it out to another 500, it's to continue this test. We had 120 stores, and we bought seasonal items and items for the back half of the year, and we exceeded the sales that we expected. So our customers are responding favorably. And what I've shared in the past is we will continue to look at the overall store sales, the overall margin and the profitability of those stores. And those, we want to see improve.\n And the tough thing is, with everything going on last year, with everything I just described with COVID, it was really hard to lift our head up and say, did the 10% of the store in the DT Plus! really drive those things that I just described. So we're going to keep testing and refining and rolling this out, but we like the results we're seeing so far."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Guiler, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the third quarter. With me on today's call will be our President and CEO, Mike Witynski; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler.\n Remarks that we will make today about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company represent forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors included in our earnings release, 8-K, 10-Q and annual report, which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements and you should not expect us to do so. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Please limit your questions to one and one related follow-up question. \n Now I will turn the call over to Mike Witynski, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer. \nMichael Witynski: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. 2020 has proven to be the most unpredictable and unique year in my 40 years in retail. Nearly every business, family and person, has had to adapt and react to what is currently a new normal. My heart goes out to every family that has been impacted to some degree by the coronavirus. I would also like to give a shout out to all the medical professionals, frontline workers and others who are working tirelessly to ensure that we stay safe and healthy.\n In an environment where individuals are concerned about their health and exposure, about their income and jobs, and about their not knowing what is next, I firmly believe that Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are part of the solution. Our 15,000-plus stores are close to home and easy to shop, providing great convenience and we offer a broad assortment of tremendous values to meet both needs and wants. I'm incredibly proud of our team's effort in the third quarter to continue serving customers effectively, while driving operational improvements in both banners through this extremely dynamic retail environment. \n The team delivered an earnings per share increase of 28.7% compared to the prior year's quarter. These enterprise results were comprised of a 5.1% same-store sales increase, a 150 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 130 basis point increase in operating profit margin. Our Dollar Tree segment delivered its strongest same-store sales performance in the past 10 quarters with a 4% increase. Gross profit margin improved 70 basis points to 34.9% versus Q3 a year ago, and operating margin increased 50 basis points to 12.7%, which represents a 300 basis point improvement from Q2. The quarter included $28.6 million in COVID-related costs. \n Geographically, comp sales were positive in all zones. For the quarter, discretionary delivered a positive 10.2% comp and consumables were down approximately 2.6%. We did see sequential improvement in consumables throughout the quarter as inventory flow of high-demand products improved. Categories performing well, included crafts, party celebrations, household products, kitchenware and even early Christmas season. The performance of Crafters Square offering that was rolled out into approximately 2,400 stores in Q1 of this year has been outstanding. We plan to add Crafters Square to the remainder of the Dollar Tree stores in early 2021.\n The Halloween seasonal sell-through was our best ever. Overall, the Fall Harvest and Halloween seasonal categories delivered a combined 9.4% comp for the quarter. Our merchants continue to hit a home run on identifying and sourcing great products that customers love at the dollar price point. Customers are continuing to shop early to celebrate events and holidays. Our sales continue to be delivered by average ticket, which increased 19% as consumers continued to consolidate trips. Our 12.6% transaction count decline was a 300 basis point plus improvement when compared to 15.9% drop that we saw just a quarter ago. We believe this is directly related to shopper mobility. \n Many people are working from home, learning from home or simply not going out as often, but when they do visit the store, they are filling their baskets. Ticket was up 19% this quarter and 22.6% last quarter. We continue to like the results we are seeing with the Dollar Tree Plus, and we are pleased to announce we are expanding the program to a total of approximately 500 stores beginning in the spring. Based on our learnings, we have continued to test, refine and improve this initiative since the initial launch in mid-2019. The merchant and store teams have done a tremendous job. Our customers are buying these products and sales of our multi-price items continue to grow. In fact, we are seeing that when multi-price items are included in the basket, the average transaction value is approximately twice the size. \n Recently, we've been seeing phenomenal sell-through of Dollar Tree Plus! items and seasonal merchandise. We are expanding our discretionary assortment to focus on sales and margin-driven categories that do not cannibalize current sales, are accretive to the business and bringing great value to our customers. These $3 and $5 items will also be leveraged through our Family Dollar stores when it makes sense. This is an example of harnessing the power of 2 brands by bringing Dollar Tree and Family Dollar together. We now have a new merchant team dedicated to these multi-price items that will benefit both banners. \n Family Dollar sales highlights for the third quarter included the 6.4% same-store sales increase was on top of the 2.3% comp in Q3 a year ago. This was comprised of a 21.3% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 12.3% decline in transaction count. The ticket and traffic trends are relatively balanced throughout the quarter. The sales strength was broad-based geographically with each zone delivering positive comps ranging 4.7% or better. Categories performing well are many of the discretionary categories that we have been focused on improving, including home decor, household products, toys, electronics and apparel. \n Both rural and urban Family Dollar stores delivered mid-single-digit comp increases with rural slightly outpacing urban. Regarding the cadence of comps, each month's increase was greater than 5.5%, with September being the strongest month and October slightly better than August. The consumable side of the business delivered another positive quarterly comp at 4.1%, and discretionary comp was strong at 14.6%. On our March call, I discussed the challenge and opportunity to enhance the discretionary performance at Family Dollar through improved product assortment, sharper price points and greater values. Customers are noticing and they are responding. \n In Q3, discretionary, as a percent of our net sales at Family Dollar, increased 140 basis points to 21.5% of sales. Our discretionary grew 2x faster than the total market in Q3. During the quarter, we launched the ability to sell product directly on our website at familydollar.com, providing customers another way to access great values. Additionally, we are early in the test phases of the following initiatives: buy online, pick up at store; and delivery options through Instacart and Shipt. There will be more to come on future calls. \n As I mentioned on our call 3 months ago, it's a new day at Family Dollar. I continue to be very pleased with the team's overall progress. We are 3 quarters into 2020 with an operating margin of 5.1% compared to 2% 3 quarters into 2019. The key elements of our improvement plan include: improved merchandising and marketing, raising stock and raising store in-stocks, upgrading brand standards, creating a selling culture and refining our format strategy. \n I would also like to recognize Dollar Tree Canada. Our Canada President and Chief Operating Officer, Neil Curran and his team are hitting on all cylinders. During Q3, Dollar Tree Canada opened 2 new stores, bringing the total to 230 stores north of the border. Canada exceeded its plan of sales, gross margin and operating income, delivering low double-digit comps in both consumables and discretionary, including very strong seasonal sales on Fall Harvest and Halloween, and they have improved on store manager turnover and internal promotion as a result of their continued focus on people development. \n Regarding real estate, the team completed more than 550 projects in the quarter, including 143 new stores, 34 relocations, 371 Family Dollar H2 renovations, and we had 16 store closings. We ended the quarter with 15,606 stores. \n I'll now toss it to Kevin to provide more detail on the Q3 performance. \nKevin Wampler: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. For the third quarter, consolidated net sales increased 7.5% to $6.18 billion, comprised of $3.3 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.87 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 5.1%. On a segment basis, comps for Family Dollar increased 6.4% and for Dollar Tree increased 4%. Dollar Tree's comp represented its best quarterly same-store sales performance since Q1 of 2018. \n Overall, gross profit for the enterprise increased 12.9% to $1.92 billion. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 31.2% compared to 29.7% in Q3 of 2019. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 70 basis points to 34.9% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise costs, including freight, improved by approximately 95 basis points. Dollar Tree saw an improvement in merchandise mix and lower freight costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by reduced markups. \n Occupancy costs decreased approximately 20 basis points due to leverage on the comp sales increase in the quarter. Shrink improved approximately 10 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by distribution costs that increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. This includes the continued ramp-up for the 2 new distribution centers as well as approximately $6.6 million or 20 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay and bonuses. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 230 basis points to 26.8% in the third quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: shrink improved to 70 basis points based on inventory results in the current year and cycling an increase in the accrual rate during the prior year. Merchandise costs including freight improved 60 basis points, primarily due to a balanced improvement in merchandise mix and markdown. \n Occupancy cost decreased approximately 60 basis points as a result of leverage from the comp sales increase and markdown expense improved approximately 40 basis points due to lower promotional activity and improved sell-through of seasonal merchandise and apparel. As a percentage of net sales, distribution costs were flat compared to the prior year quarter. The current year quarter included approximately $4.3 million or 15 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay and bonuses. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 23.7% of net sales compared to 23.5% in Q3 a year ago. For the third quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales increased to 22.2% compared to 22% in Q3 of 2019. Payroll costs increased approximately 50 basis points based on payroll expenses increasingly -- increasing $17.3 million or 50 basis points for costs associated with COVID-19 premium paying bonuses. Store facility costs decreased 15 basis points, primarily due to leverage of the stronger same-store sales and lower electricity costs. \n Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 5 basis points, primarily from lower travel and legal costs. The SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 20 basis points to 22.2% compared to 22.4% for the third quarter of 2019. Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 20 basis points, primarily due to lower advertising and travel costs as a percentage of net sales. \n Store facility costs improved approximately 20 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales and lower electricity costs, and depreciation improved 10 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales increase. These benefits were partially offset by payroll expenses, which increased approximately 35 basis points driven by COVID-19 costs of $11.4 million or 40 basis points for premium paying bonuses and increased incentive compensation based on performance. \n Operating income increased 29.9% to $465.5 million compared with $358.4 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin improved 130 basis points to 7.5% compared to last year's third quarter. Current year quarter included $46.3 million in COVID-19-related expenses in total. Nonoperating expenses totaled $38.2 million comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 22.8% compared to 19.3% in the prior year's third quarter. Current quarter rate reflects higher state tax rate and higher income amounts taxed at the statutory rate. Prior year rate reflected a larger benefit from the reconciliation of the tax provision to the tax return. \n The company had net income of $330 million or $1.39 per diluted share, which included $46.3 million or $0.15 per diluted share of incremental operating costs for COVID-19-related expenses. This compares to net earnings of $255.8 million or $1.08 per share in the prior year's quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.12 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. Company paid down the remaining $500 million on its revolving line of credit during the quarter. Outstanding debt as of October 31, 2020, was $3.55 billion. \n During the quarter, we purchased nearly 2.2 million shares for $200 million. At quarter end, we had $600 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to provide post-quarter updates on share repurchase activity. Inventory of our Dollar Tree at quarter end declined 1.8% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 4.2%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 5.8% and inventory levels are well positioned for the holiday selling season. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end decreased 2.9% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 1.1%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 4%. Our inventory levels improved in Q3, and we continue to be more productive with lower inventory, significantly increasing our inventory turns. \n Capital expenditures were $238.7 million in the third quarter versus $279.8 million in Q3 last year. And for fiscal 2020, we continue to expect consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion. Depreciation and amortization totaled $170.1 million for Q3 compared to $160 million in the third quarter last year. As for fiscal 2020, we now expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $680 million. \n While we are not providing sales and EPS guidance, I do want to provide a few data points for your modeling. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $37 million in Q4 and $151 million for fiscal 2020. The tax rate is expected to be 22.3% for the fourth quarter and 22.8% for fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.3 million shares for Q4 and 237.5 million shares for the full year. We have a strong balance sheet and continue to grow the company by investing in both new and renovated stores, our supply chain and technology to improve the customer experience. We remain confident in our business and our ability to drive long-term shareholder value. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thanks, Kevin. We certainly have momentum in our business. For Q3 in a challenging retail environment with government stimulus mostly behind us, we delivered very solid enterprise results, including a positive 5.1% comp, 150 basis points of gross margin improvement and 130 basis points of operating margin improvement despite incurring more than $46 million in COVID-related costs. Additionally, we completed more than 550 real estate projects, paid down the $500 million drawn on our revolving line of credit and repurchased $200 million in stock. Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to grow the business and create shareholder value. \n It is still very early, but I am encouraged by our start to the current quarter. We are just over 3 weeks into our important fourth quarter, and we are off to a very good start with same-store sales at both banners currently tracking above reported third quarter levels. We are truly leveraging the power of both brands. Actions taken in 2019, including the consolidation of store support centers and the alignment of organizational leadership under one team are paying off. Examples include: we are experiencing improved accessibility to a broader base of manufacturers and vendors by going to market as a 15,000-plus store chain. Many vendors are willing to work with us to support both the dollar price points as well as price points above the dollar. Our merchant teams are harmonized to act with clarity, focus and speed. \n When the first COVID wave hit in March, we took action to derisk the Halloween season and actually saw the best sell-through in company history. This fall, we modified our assortments away from the traditional cold and allergy and to more focus on health products, vitamins and face covering. We also made strategic buys on paper, soaps and sanitizers to get ahead of the curve as COVID cases were expected to pick up in the second wave. \n Our seasonal businesses, both at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are doing very well. We are able to be a convenient shopping trip to meet the needs of those staying at home, eating at home, working at home and/or learning at home. We are seeing greater sales of seasonal product as it hits our stores. Customers are buying ahead and not waiting until the last minute. This is resulting in better sell-through and reduced markdown exposure. We will continue to develop new strategic store formats so we are able to better serve our customers while improving store productivity, margins and returns. We want formats that utilize the best of both brands to serve customers in all types of geographic markets. This will be a story of evolution, change and improvement.\n Our gross margin return on investment or GMROI at Family Dollar is the highest it has been since we have owned the business. This is a combination of improved sales, gross margin and inventory returns. An example is our apparel category where we delivered a significant improvement in sales and margin with material-less inventory. This is while the overall market has been down for apparel. We are focused on delivering the basics at greater values, sharper price points. The team has undergone a significant amount of work to get us to this stage with one consolidated store support center, a strong balance sheet and an aligned, energized and focused leadership team and a full staff of talented retailers. We believe we have the ability to better serve customers across North America.\n Our actions represent a transformational opportunity to leverage the power of both of our brands through flexible store formats designed to drive operational results and enhance shareholder value. Before we go to your questions, I'd like to wish all of our stakeholders, a safe and happy holiday season. I believe we are all looking forward to the arrival of 2021. It's almost here.\n Operator, we are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Nice quarter. I'll ask one and a follow-up as one full question. First, the quarter-to-date acceleration at both banners, what do you attribute it to? Is there any stocking up going on at the Family Dollar banner? And you mentioned maybe some -- like shopping earlier. Is there any signs of pull-forward of holiday spending? \n And then I just want to go back to the Dollar Tree Plus! for a second. It sounds like you are excited. The initial results are good. I guess my question, a little tongue-in-cheek, is, why did it take so long if it sounds like it's so successful? Why didn't it come sooner? And anything about the current backdrop that could be unreliable as a test? \nMichael Witynski: Thanks for the question. Yes. So quarter-to-date, we are seeing some of the stack up right now. It's not quite at the level as it was back in March and April. We're estimating at about 30% of the rate it was earlier in the year, but we can see that they are stocking up now. And the seasonal pull-through is some pull-forward sales. We do see they are buying earlier and decorating their homes, and that's really helping us a lot in our sell-through. We have less markdowns and so there's less exposure there and ability to get more product out on our sales floor. \n Regarding Dollar Tree Plus!, while I know it seems like it takes long, but this is really -- it's similar to other tests that we have. When we have our Crafters Square, we tested it in 3 or 4 stores, then we put it out into 800 stores and then rolled it out. And now we're rolling out to the chain and that took probably 18 months to 2 years. It's just that we didn't show you all the backdrop of the early testing. And we took the same pace as we were looking in our snack zones at Dollar Tree. We tested that for a year in stores and refined it and then rolled it out to a certain amount of stores and then began our process. \n So this is what we're doing, the same process. We want to make sure it's right and aligned, and we've even learned a lot from our process by shifting a lot from consumables into the discretionary items that the customer really wants that we can bring great value in. And it also takes our buyers' time to go -- these are import items and we actually manufacture and create these items to be a great value and a wild factor at the $3 and $5 price point. So we want to make sure it's the right thing, and it's adding value to our customers and to our company as well. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: So Mike, just a follow-up on Dollar Tree Plus!. I was hoping that you could provide a bit more color on the actual decision to expand the test. Any more detail in terms of what you've seen from a sales lift or a margin impact in the stores where the product is currently? Why is 500 stores the right number? And then it's notable that you have a team that's now focused on this product internally. So what does that say about where we go from here? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Well, I think the first answer is that we're organizing around the strategy. So that tells you that there is commitment there that we want to find great products at the $3 and $5 price points, and it gives us the ability to also leverage that across both banners where it makes sense. And the 500 is, it gives us -- we're actually rolling it out to more distribution stores and we look at stores that are sized appropriate, where we can bring this product into those stores. So 500 is an estimate of stores around those distribution centers. And it also gives us enough stores to really see how it continues to grow and improve and how our customers respond. \n We like the results. We can tell that the sales are growing compared to when the sales of the consumable items, they're reacting more. So the overall sales of these items are growing. The challenge we have is, in the backdrop of the COVID with all the increase in sales and mix of the stores that how it shifted, it's really hard for us to isolate those specific categories in those stores. But it's easy enough there's enough evidence that the sales of those specific categories are doing well enough, and our customers are responding, that we're going to continue to roll it out and test it more. The things that we do like is even in the seasonal items, where the $3 and $5 items are really responding well and seasonal. \nEdward Kelly: And just a quick follow-up related to that. So I think it was about a year ago that when asked about this initiative, you guys had talked about how customer response that may be like 1/3 of customer has liked it, 1/3 were in different, 1/3 didn't like it. And I think it had people sort of thinking like maybe this is not something that would make sense. How has that customer response changed? \nMichael Witynski: Well, I think the #1 thing that we could see is the sales are up over the program when it was consumables. So we think that they're responding favorably because the products that we are buying are selling through at the rate we expect and it's continuing to grow. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on the performance guys. \nMichael Witynski: Thanks, Matt. \nMatthew Boss: Maybe first on Dollar Tree banner gross margins. What drove the 95 basis points of merchandise margin expansion this quarter? How best to think about puts and takes in modeling fourth quarter gross margin at Dollar Tree? And I know we've talked in the past about the return to 35% to 36% gross margin. Is there any impediment to getting there potentially next year at the Dollar Tree banner? \nKevin Wampler: Matt, this is Kevin. So obviously, as we went through the quarter, mix was an important component of driving the improved merchandise margin, that and freight. So which again, mix moved about 300 basis points year-over-year towards discretionary, and that really speaks to obviously, things like Halloween, which Mike spoke to, we had a great sell-through; speaks to Crafters Square, which has just been a dynamic element in our stores. \n So I think those are important things as we've seen that mix shift a little bit. And maybe a little counterintuitive of the fact that we saw improvement in freight. But you have to remember, a year ago, from a compare standpoint, we saw a pretty big increase a year ago from a surge standpoint, and so our comparisons were maybe a little bit different than some people. So we actually saw a little bit there. So I think that's important at the end of the day. \n So -- and again, I think we saw some leverage with the comp on occupancy, which, again, obviously, was a forward comp, we would expect leverage there. But as far as the 35% to 36%, this was our best gross profit in Q3 since, I believe, 2017. It gets us on track to basically, if we continue this type of trend, where we would be able to be in that 35% to 36% range. And again, nothing -- there is no barrier stopping us. So we just have to continue to build the business as we always have, and I think the discretionary side is very strong right now, and I think that's a big benefit as well. \nMatthew Boss: That's great. And then as a follow-up on the Family Dollar side, what have you seen from new customers relative to spending from existing customers more recently and the improved performance? How to think about retaining some of these new customers? And maybe larger picture, how do you envision, Mike, the Family Dollar comp story as we think about relative to the low single-digit historical comp profile at Dollar Tree? Do you see it similar? Do you see it lagging? What's the best way to think about Family Dollar multiyear relative to comps at Dollar Tree in your opinion? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. In my opinion, I see it similar to the Dollar Tree, low single-digit, continued growth year after year in comp store sales growth. I think both banners should be able to settle into that with no problem. Regarding the new customers, we -- what we're seeing is just overall, it's very similar to new and old, as I shared in the prepared remarks that when the customers are coming into the store, they are shopping with intent. And what we do like to see is they're shopping the entire store in the discretionary side that we are working so hard on to fill that basket, and we're seeing our discretionary side grow with both new and old customers. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nBradley Thomas: Nice quarter here. I was hoping you could give a little color on how you all are starting to think about 2021 at this point. Clearly, 2020 is shaping up to be a good year for you all, but there are also some dynamics like traffic that have been challenges for you. I guess how are you thinking about some of the puts and takes at a high level at this point for next year? \nMichael Witynski: Matt, we're all looking forward to 2021. I think -- the way I think about it, I do think that customers, the dynamic in their shopping patterns have changed, and I think it's going to be slow to change. I don't think there's going to be a light switch that's going to turn on and all of a sudden, they'll go back to their old shopping patterns and activity. I think we will keep going after driving that basket size, and when they are in our stores, drive it with intent. \nKevin Wampler: I think the other thing, Brad, is, obviously, as Mike laid out early this year, focus on discretionary business in the Family Dollar store. And obviously, we've had the pandemic this year, which is obviously muddies the water a little bit, but it's obviously an area that we feel where we can drive new business and convert more customers at the end of the day. \n The team continues to work cross-functionally to build out those assortments, and we saw our best Halloween sell-through in the time we've owned Family Dollar this year. So that tells us that we can sell seasonal. It can be a bigger part of the overall business, and it needs to be part of our overall business, a bigger part as we go forward. So it's going to be a continued focus, just like we talked about early this year. \nBradley Thomas: Great. And if I could ask a follow-up on the H2 stores. You talked about your plans for the multi-price expansion on the Dollar Tree side. Do you have a target at this point for how many H2 renovations you'll do next year? I know you pared back a little bit this year in the COVID backdrop? How are you thinking about those models next year? \nKevin Wampler: Yes, Brad, you're right. This year, about 750, H2. We ended the year expecting to about 1,250, but obviously, COVID kind of gotten in the way of that. We do expect 1,250 additional H2s in 2021 to continue that process forward. It continues to be something that we can build upon. Our customers really like the layout and the offering and the assortment, and it's an important part of the growth as we go forward. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. \nPeter Keith: Maybe just to touch base quickly on some of the gross margin trends. This looks like the first time in a while where shrink is now a tailwind. So have you gotten over the hump where you think you've controlled shrink? And can you continue to see some benefit there? And similarly, on gross margin, freight has a nice tailwind for Q3, but we have seen freight rates jump rather dramatically. How should we think about that impact in the fourth quarter? \nKevin Wampler: Yes. Two really good questions. Thanks for the question, Peter. I think as we look at it, shrink, we did see some nice improvement. Again, it has been a headwind for much longer than it should have been. And as I've stated before, it's been front and center on many people's desks. I would tell you, a good call out for our operators and our asset protection team. We've made progress. We've got some momentum. I would tell you, we are not where we need to be, overall, yet. \n Our goal is to be not just good but to be class-leading as it relates to this, and we have more work to do. But the good news is, we have some momentum, which is very, very positive. Do I expect it to be a benefit? I think it could be a benefit as we go forward into Q4, albeit not to the same rate on the Family Dollar side because we were cycling a fairly big increase in the accrual rates in Q3 a year ago, but I do believe there can be some improvement there. \n As it relates to freight, I would tell you, while it was a good guide for us in Q3, I expect that to be somewhat tempered in Q4. To your point, again, as I stated earlier on the call, Q3 last year, our freight was significantly high due to surge, costs and just moving trailers. We have seen some of that increase that you just spoke to in the rates. The team -- the transportation team is working really hard to mitigate every dollar they can but I don't expect it to be the same type of benefit in Q4 than it was in Q3. And then we saw more of that on the Dollar Tree side than we did on the Family Dollar side, just from a banner specific side -- I think -- way to think of it. So it's kind of how those 2 items look to play out as we go forward. \nPeter Keith: Okay. Maybe a separate question for Mike. Mike, you pushed out some omnichannel initiatives, it looks like you're looking at BOPIS for Family Dollar. Maybe give us a little bit of sense on what you guys are playing out with there? And is it only on the Family Dollar business where you're looking at that? Or would you think about more omnichannel investment needed for Dollar Tree as well? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, thanks for the question. It's a great question. We think it's critical. And especially after this year, as you've seen by others and how the customer is really moving into the omnichannel and using that. So we definitely are going to build that capability at both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. And like we have organized around our Dollar Tree Plus!, we are organizing around our omnichannel business as well. We've got a new leader there, who's got great experience, and we will accelerate our capabilities. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. \nChandni Luthra: This is Chandni Luthra at Goldman. Just building up on that last question on omnichannel. You've also talked about introducing delivery at Family Dollar. If you could provide any color on what early reads are? What sort of customer is buying back? What the delivery basket is looking like? And finally, how do you think about economics with Family Dollar, economics to ship-to-home with Family Dollar? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, it's really early. We launched it mid- to late quarter. I would say, we really like the basket size. We like the product that they are buying inside the basket, and we're excited about offering that opportunity to our customers as they shift in some of their behaviors. The beautiful thing is, we've got -- we are 15,000 store chains, and we're conveniently located in their neighborhoods and close to their stores. And then when we combine that with their ability, should they want to buy online or pick up in store or get it delivered at home, we're going to have that capability as well. But it's really early for us, but we do like the basket we're seeing and the mix of the product. \nChandni Luthra: Got it. And I guess my follow-up is a little bit long-term as we sort of think about 2021 and beyond. There is a lot of talk about raising the federal minimum wage threshold. Could you perhaps give us color in terms of what percentage of your employees are in minimum wage? How do you think about if that headwind were to come about? How should we think about that? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, that's a good question because we think about that a lot. And as a minimum, as you can imagine, the state minimum wages are all over the Board, and it's hard for me to -- it would be a different number by state and geography, but there are probably 6 to 7 states already on their path to that $15 an hour minimum wage that they've announced several years ago, and they're on their path to that. \n So our operating teams are absolutely working on driving, first and foremost, in-store efficiencies. You look at -- if you can bring in technology and self-scanning to help leverage some of your resources that way. Our merchants continue to look at merchandising methods through shelf-ready PEQs and then distribution methods. I mean, those are our 3 levers that we can pull: our operators in the store, technology, distribution and the product our merchants are buying are all the things that we actively are going to be working on. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Michael Montani with Evercore. \nMichael Montani: Just wanted to ask, first off, on flow-through rates, if I could, for the fourth quarter. Third quarter was quite healthy in the mid-20% range. So I just wanted to see if there's any puts and takes that you would call out to think about at the enterprise level, if that is sustainable? And then I just had a follow-up on Dollar Tree Plus!. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. As it relates to flow through, it was a very good month -- or a very good quarter, I should say, in regards to flow through. Obviously, we've got significant leverage across both businesses, and we saw obviously help on the mix, in particular, from both to help gross profit. Generally, as you go into Q4, I would tell you, where I do expect gross profit to improve year-over-year, but not at the same rate as on a consolidated basis as it did in Q3, just based upon some of the things that we won't necessarily repeat, which we've talked about today. So shrink may not be a big of a help and freight may not be as big of a help and things like that. So the flow-through probably won't be quite the same on total gross profit.\n But in general, Q4 does tend to be a higher discretionary period for Dollar Tree in particular, and we see some of our traditionally some of our highest margin out of all of our four quarters. So some put and takes there. I think, obviously, we expect some improvement. It just won't be the same probably as much as what we saw in Q3. \nMichael Montani: Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could, just around Dollar Tree Plus!, I want to see if there's any incremental color that you could share in terms of how the stores were performing relative to the overall chain from a comp perspective when you roll out Dollar Tree Plus!? And if there's any incremental color perhaps related to that on incrementality, either in terms of shoppers or kind of basket size. Just any incremental color there? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, Mike, thanks for your question on the DT Plus!. As I shared earlier, right now, when you look at relative performance to other stores or prior the challenge we have is when we change to our 2.0 and brought in all our discretionary, it landed right in March. So there was so much noise around other stores and/or themselves that is really hard for us to determine the lift that was associated specifically to these products. And remember, the linear footage, it's still 10% to 11% of the total store. So it's hard to see what this is doing. \n But the 2 things we do see, we like the sales that these are -- the product that we're putting in there at the $3 and $5 price point are selling. It's also selling at a much higher-margin because it's discretionary product, and we're able to manufacture these products and bring value to the customer. And then the third thing we can see is the basket size. When one of these items are in the basket, it is twice the basket size when they're not in there. Those are the things that we can see, and it gives us courage to keep moving forward, and we're going to keep on fueling it. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital. \nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli. I know you guys have made a really concerted effort to improve your discretionary mix. But have you been surprised by the magnitude of change in discretionary versus consumable mix? And then related to that, are there any supply issues with consumables? Or is that just not where your -- what your customer is looking for in today's environment? \nMichael Witynski: Scot, thanks for the questions. I'll answer the first, the consumable. We are chasing the product and the national brand, and it's the products that our COVID related and manufacturers are still trying to build up capacity. And it's in the paper, the hand sanitizers, the wipes and some consumable-related products. So we -- the inventory levels are improving from April, but they are still not caught up with the demand. So yes, we're still chasing a little bit of that and there's still some upside capacity there. \nKevin Wampler: Scot, I think your question around discretionary and the strength there, I mean, obviously, I think, one, it does speak a little bit to the pattern of the consumer. They are buying closer to home, and so it's definitely a part of it. But it's really the categories that they're buying itself, right? So people -- as we've talked about, seasonal, in particular, has been good as people try to stay somewhat normal of what's been an unusual period of time, decorate their homes or supplement their soft home and our Family Dollar stores has done well. If you think about that as they kind of resupply their home and things like that and decor. \n So a lot of things like that have done very well. Those are things we think we can provide on a regular basis. And I think it gives us the opportunity to show folks what we have in that arena and hopefully convert them to continued shoppers with us as we go forward. So it's a good opportunity as we continue to build out that assortment. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. And just a little bit more color on -- just a little bit more color on that. Our merchants have worked really hard at providing a much better value at sharper price points and it met the need for the last several months, as Kevin just described. So that is going to be going forward. Our merchants are going to continue to buy better, buy basics and buy great value and supply that to the customer from this point forward. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: In response to an earlier question, I think it was Ed's on Dollar Tree Plus!. You mentioned something about doing it in stores that are close to the DC, I think. Just want to make sure I understood that and whether the Dollar Tree Plus! rollout would be in certain geographies. \n Also, if you're happy with the test, are there any limits to how many stores could get this assortment, either because of store size or proximity to DC? And then just a follow-up, maybe a silly question, but why don't you like the even numbers $2 and $4 when you think about that Dollar Tree product? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. So the first one, the reason we're rolling it out, no, we're not limited by proximity to the DCs at all. It's really about bringing in these products into a DC, so you're bringing in and creating slots for the different items. And we're going to do our due diligence and roll this out and test. And the store size was really more related to -- we do not want to impact our single price point assortment that the customers used to in our stores. So we're looking for size of stores right now during the test that doesn't adversely impact that assortment. So that's the only reason we're doing that. \n And then -- yes, on your question on the $2 and $4, we're looking for great value at great products. And the $3 and $5 price points seem to resonate more with our customers, and it differentiates itself from the Dollar price point. And we don't want to muddy the water with those in between products. We want to really focus on step changing items that we're selling for $3 and $5 that are really $7 and $10 items anywhere else in retail. So I want to -- we're trying to bring clarity to ourselves, to our merchants and for our customers on the value. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And just a follow-up on the store side. What percent of the fleet are large enough to handle that Dollar Tree Plus! assortment at this point? \nMichael Witynski: I do not have that right now with me. Well, we can -- Randy can get that for you. \nOperator: We'll take our last question from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: You outlined the diligent and disciplined process that you typically go through when you're rolling out initiatives from pilot to test to full rollout. Could you see any conditions under which you would roll back this test or this expansion of the test of 500 Dollar Tree Plus! locations, particularly given some of the opacity that you spoke about in determining the results of the initial 100 in the last 6 months. Then I have a follow-up. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. So I mean, so the obvious one, if it impacts -- if we had adverse implications to comp store sales in the stores and/or margin dollars, and it's not accretive to the business. I mean, that's what we're really looking for is that it's -- this program has to be accretive to sales margin and operating income and that's what our expectations are. \nMichael Lasser: Have you gotten to a point like this where you expanded the test and then subsequently had to roll back the test? \nMichael Witynski: I'm sorry, what was the question? \nMichael Lasser: Have you gotten to a point like this where you've taken a test to the next level and then subsequently have had to roll it back? \nMichael Witynski: I can't remember one to this level, no. We've got certainly a lot of tests out there that we never went forward with, but no, not to this level. \nMichael Lasser: And my follow-up question, Mike, is on framing the Family Dollar consumable business, which increased in the 4% range in the most recent quarter. If we compare that to a lot of the results from the other consumable retailers, it was a bit slower and perhaps suggests that the Family Dollar's market share in those categories was lagging behind others. How do you think about that and how do you see the ability to improve share from this point for Family Dollar? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, that's a great question. But first and foremost, it was a positive low single digits. So we continue to grow our consumable sales. And 9 months ago in March, we were talking about how consumable has always been healthy for the Family Dollar business, and I foresee that continuing to grow. And we're going to keep doing the same thing as we are on the discretionary side. \n We're bringing great values. We're going to have the right assortment. We're going to sharpen our price points to be competitive in the marketplace. And we are chasing the inventory. I would say on the consumable side, we are not happy with our everyday in-store stocks on consumables. So we believe that we can build that business going forward. \nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to Randy Guiler for closing remarks. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Shelby, and thank you for joining us for today's call and for your interest in Dollar Tree. We would like to wish our best wishes to all of you for a happy and safe holiday season. Our next earnings conference call to discuss Q4 and full year results is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, March 3, 2021. Have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Wampler",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning. For the third quarter, consolidated net sales increased 7.5% to $6.18 billion, comprised of $3.3 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.87 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 5.1%. On a segment basis, comps for Family Dollar increased 6.4% and for Dollar Tree increased 4%. Dollar Tree's comp represented its best quarterly same-store sales performance since Q1 of 2018. \n Overall, gross profit for the enterprise increased 12.9% to $1.92 billion. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 31.2% compared to 29.7% in Q3 of 2019. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 70 basis points to 34.9% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise costs, including freight, improved by approximately 95 basis points. Dollar Tree saw an improvement in merchandise mix and lower freight costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by reduced markups. \n Occupancy costs decreased approximately 20 basis points due to leverage on the comp sales increase in the quarter. Shrink improved approximately 10 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by distribution costs that increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. This includes the continued ramp-up for the 2 new distribution centers as well as approximately $6.6 million or 20 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay and bonuses. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 230 basis points to 26.8% in the third quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: shrink improved to 70 basis points based on inventory results in the current year and cycling an increase in the accrual rate during the prior year. Merchandise costs including freight improved 60 basis points, primarily due to a balanced improvement in merchandise mix and markdown. \n Occupancy cost decreased approximately 60 basis points as a result of leverage from the comp sales increase and markdown expense improved approximately 40 basis points due to lower promotional activity and improved sell-through of seasonal merchandise and apparel. As a percentage of net sales, distribution costs were flat compared to the prior year quarter. The current year quarter included approximately $4.3 million or 15 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay and bonuses. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 23.7% of net sales compared to 23.5% in Q3 a year ago. For the third quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales increased to 22.2% compared to 22% in Q3 of 2019. Payroll costs increased approximately 50 basis points based on payroll expenses increasingly -- increasing $17.3 million or 50 basis points for costs associated with COVID-19 premium paying bonuses. Store facility costs decreased 15 basis points, primarily due to leverage of the stronger same-store sales and lower electricity costs. \n Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 5 basis points, primarily from lower travel and legal costs. The SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 20 basis points to 22.2% compared to 22.4% for the third quarter of 2019. Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 20 basis points, primarily due to lower advertising and travel costs as a percentage of net sales. \n Store facility costs improved approximately 20 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales and lower electricity costs, and depreciation improved 10 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales increase. These benefits were partially offset by payroll expenses, which increased approximately 35 basis points driven by COVID-19 costs of $11.4 million or 40 basis points for premium paying bonuses and increased incentive compensation based on performance. \n Operating income increased 29.9% to $465.5 million compared with $358.4 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin improved 130 basis points to 7.5% compared to last year's third quarter. Current year quarter included $46.3 million in COVID-19-related expenses in total. Nonoperating expenses totaled $38.2 million comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 22.8% compared to 19.3% in the prior year's third quarter. Current quarter rate reflects higher state tax rate and higher income amounts taxed at the statutory rate. Prior year rate reflected a larger benefit from the reconciliation of the tax provision to the tax return. \n The company had net income of $330 million or $1.39 per diluted share, which included $46.3 million or $0.15 per diluted share of incremental operating costs for COVID-19-related expenses. This compares to net earnings of $255.8 million or $1.08 per share in the prior year's quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.12 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. Company paid down the remaining $500 million on its revolving line of credit during the quarter. Outstanding debt as of October 31, 2020, was $3.55 billion. \n During the quarter, we purchased nearly 2.2 million shares for $200 million. At quarter end, we had $600 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to provide post-quarter updates on share repurchase activity. Inventory of our Dollar Tree at quarter end declined 1.8% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 4.2%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 5.8% and inventory levels are well positioned for the holiday selling season. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end decreased 2.9% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 1.1%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 4%. Our inventory levels improved in Q3, and we continue to be more productive with lower inventory, significantly increasing our inventory turns. \n Capital expenditures were $238.7 million in the third quarter versus $279.8 million in Q3 last year. And for fiscal 2020, we continue to expect consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion. Depreciation and amortization totaled $170.1 million for Q3 compared to $160 million in the third quarter last year. As for fiscal 2020, we now expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $680 million. \n While we are not providing sales and EPS guidance, I do want to provide a few data points for your modeling. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $37 million in Q4 and $151 million for fiscal 2020. The tax rate is expected to be 22.3% for the fourth quarter and 22.8% for fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.3 million shares for Q4 and 237.5 million shares for the full year. We have a strong balance sheet and continue to grow the company by investing in both new and renovated stores, our supply chain and technology to improve the customer experience. We remain confident in our business and our ability to drive long-term shareholder value. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. Matt, this is Kevin. So obviously, as we went through the quarter, mix was an important component of driving the improved merchandise margin, that and freight. So which again, mix moved about 300 basis points year-over-year towards discretionary, and that really speaks to obviously, things like Halloween, which Mike spoke to, we had a great sell-through; speaks to Crafters Square, which has just been a dynamic element in our stores. \n So I think those are important things as we've seen that mix shift a little bit. And maybe a little counterintuitive of the fact that we saw improvement in freight. But you have to remember, a year ago, from a compare standpoint, we saw a pretty big increase a year ago from a surge standpoint, and so our comparisons were maybe a little bit different than some people. So we actually saw a little bit there. So I think that's important at the end of the day. \n So -- and again, I think we saw some leverage with the comp on occupancy, which, again, obviously, was a forward comp, we would expect leverage there. But as far as the 35% to 36%, this was our best gross profit in Q3 since, I believe, 2017. It gets us on track to basically, if we continue this type of trend, where we would be able to be in that 35% to 36% range. And again, nothing -- there is no barrier stopping us. So we just have to continue to build the business as we always have, and I think the discretionary side is very strong right now, and I think that's a big benefit as well. I think the other thing, Brad, is, obviously, as Mike laid out early this year, focus on discretionary business in the Family Dollar store. And obviously, we've had the pandemic this year, which is obviously muddies the water a little bit, but it's obviously an area that we feel where we can drive new business and convert more customers at the end of the day. \n The team continues to work cross-functionally to build out those assortments, and we saw our best Halloween sell-through in the time we've owned Family Dollar this year. So that tells us that we can sell seasonal. It can be a bigger part of the overall business, and it needs to be part of our overall business, a bigger part as we go forward. So it's going to be a continued focus, just like we talked about early this year. Yes, Brad, you're right. This year, about 750, H2. We ended the year expecting to about 1,250, but obviously, COVID kind of gotten in the way of that. We do expect 1,250 additional H2s in 2021 to continue that process forward. It continues to be something that we can build upon. Our customers really like the layout and the offering and the assortment, and it's an important part of the growth as we go forward. Yes. Two really good questions. Thanks for the question, Peter. I think as we look at it, shrink, we did see some nice improvement. Again, it has been a headwind for much longer than it should have been. And as I've stated before, it's been front and center on many people's desks. I would tell you, a good call out for our operators and our asset protection team. We've made progress. We've got some momentum. I would tell you, we are not where we need to be, overall, yet. \n Our goal is to be not just good but to be class-leading as it relates to this, and we have more work to do. But the good news is, we have some momentum, which is very, very positive. Do I expect it to be a benefit? I think it could be a benefit as we go forward into Q4, albeit not to the same rate on the Family Dollar side because we were cycling a fairly big increase in the accrual rates in Q3 a year ago, but I do believe there can be some improvement there. \n As it relates to freight, I would tell you, while it was a good guide for us in Q3, I expect that to be somewhat tempered in Q4. To your point, again, as I stated earlier on the call, Q3 last year, our freight was significantly high due to surge, costs and just moving trailers. We have seen some of that increase that you just spoke to in the rates. The team -- the transportation team is working really hard to mitigate every dollar they can but I don't expect it to be the same type of benefit in Q4 than it was in Q3. And then we saw more of that on the Dollar Tree side than we did on the Family Dollar side, just from a banner specific side -- I think -- way to think of it. So it's kind of how those 2 items look to play out as we go forward. Yes. As it relates to flow through, it was a very good month -- or a very good quarter, I should say, in regards to flow through. Obviously, we've got significant leverage across both businesses, and we saw obviously help on the mix, in particular, from both to help gross profit. Generally, as you go into Q4, I would tell you, where I do expect gross profit to improve year-over-year, but not at the same rate as on a consolidated basis as it did in Q3, just based upon some of the things that we won't necessarily repeat, which we've talked about today. So shrink may not be a big of a help and freight may not be as big of a help and things like that. So the flow-through probably won't be quite the same on total gross profit.\n But in general, Q4 does tend to be a higher discretionary period for Dollar Tree in particular, and we see some of our traditionally some of our highest margin out of all of our four quarters. So some put and takes there. I think, obviously, we expect some improvement. It just won't be the same probably as much as what we saw in Q3. Scot, I think your question around discretionary and the strength there, I mean, obviously, I think, one, it does speak a little bit to the pattern of the consumer. They are buying closer to home, and so it's definitely a part of it. But it's really the categories that they're buying itself, right? So people -- as we've talked about, seasonal, in particular, has been good as people try to stay somewhat normal of what's been an unusual period of time, decorate their homes or supplement their soft home and our Family Dollar stores has done well. If you think about that as they kind of resupply their home and things like that and decor. \n So a lot of things like that have done very well. Those are things we think we can provide on a regular basis. And I think it gives us the opportunity to show folks what we have in that arena and hopefully convert them to continued shoppers with us as we go forward. So it's a good opportunity as we continue to build out that assortment."

            "name": "Michael Witynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. 2020 has proven to be the most unpredictable and unique year in my 40 years in retail. Nearly every business, family and person, has had to adapt and react to what is currently a new normal. My heart goes out to every family that has been impacted to some degree by the coronavirus. I would also like to give a shout out to all the medical professionals, frontline workers and others who are working tirelessly to ensure that we stay safe and healthy.\n In an environment where individuals are concerned about their health and exposure, about their income and jobs, and about their not knowing what is next, I firmly believe that Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are part of the solution. Our 15,000-plus stores are close to home and easy to shop, providing great convenience and we offer a broad assortment of tremendous values to meet both needs and wants. I'm incredibly proud of our team's effort in the third quarter to continue serving customers effectively, while driving operational improvements in both banners through this extremely dynamic retail environment. \n The team delivered an earnings per share increase of 28.7% compared to the prior year's quarter. These enterprise results were comprised of a 5.1% same-store sales increase, a 150 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 130 basis point increase in operating profit margin. Our Dollar Tree segment delivered its strongest same-store sales performance in the past 10 quarters with a 4% increase. Gross profit margin improved 70 basis points to 34.9% versus Q3 a year ago, and operating margin increased 50 basis points to 12.7%, which represents a 300 basis point improvement from Q2. The quarter included $28.6 million in COVID-related costs. \n Geographically, comp sales were positive in all zones. For the quarter, discretionary delivered a positive 10.2% comp and consumables were down approximately 2.6%. We did see sequential improvement in consumables throughout the quarter as inventory flow of high-demand products improved. Categories performing well, included crafts, party celebrations, household products, kitchenware and even early Christmas season. The performance of Crafters Square offering that was rolled out into approximately 2,400 stores in Q1 of this year has been outstanding. We plan to add Crafters Square to the remainder of the Dollar Tree stores in early 2021.\n The Halloween seasonal sell-through was our best ever. Overall, the Fall Harvest and Halloween seasonal categories delivered a combined 9.4% comp for the quarter. Our merchants continue to hit a home run on identifying and sourcing great products that customers love at the dollar price point. Customers are continuing to shop early to celebrate events and holidays. Our sales continue to be delivered by average ticket, which increased 19% as consumers continued to consolidate trips. Our 12.6% transaction count decline was a 300 basis point plus improvement when compared to 15.9% drop that we saw just a quarter ago. We believe this is directly related to shopper mobility. \n Many people are working from home, learning from home or simply not going out as often, but when they do visit the store, they are filling their baskets. Ticket was up 19% this quarter and 22.6% last quarter. We continue to like the results we are seeing with the Dollar Tree Plus, and we are pleased to announce we are expanding the program to a total of approximately 500 stores beginning in the spring. Based on our learnings, we have continued to test, refine and improve this initiative since the initial launch in mid-2019. The merchant and store teams have done a tremendous job. Our customers are buying these products and sales of our multi-price items continue to grow. In fact, we are seeing that when multi-price items are included in the basket, the average transaction value is approximately twice the size. \n Recently, we've been seeing phenomenal sell-through of Dollar Tree Plus! items and seasonal merchandise. We are expanding our discretionary assortment to focus on sales and margin-driven categories that do not cannibalize current sales, are accretive to the business and bringing great value to our customers. These $3 and $5 items will also be leveraged through our Family Dollar stores when it makes sense. This is an example of harnessing the power of 2 brands by bringing Dollar Tree and Family Dollar together. We now have a new merchant team dedicated to these multi-price items that will benefit both banners. \n Family Dollar sales highlights for the third quarter included the 6.4% same-store sales increase was on top of the 2.3% comp in Q3 a year ago. This was comprised of a 21.3% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 12.3% decline in transaction count. The ticket and traffic trends are relatively balanced throughout the quarter. The sales strength was broad-based geographically with each zone delivering positive comps ranging 4.7% or better. Categories performing well are many of the discretionary categories that we have been focused on improving, including home decor, household products, toys, electronics and apparel. \n Both rural and urban Family Dollar stores delivered mid-single-digit comp increases with rural slightly outpacing urban. Regarding the cadence of comps, each month's increase was greater than 5.5%, with September being the strongest month and October slightly better than August. The consumable side of the business delivered another positive quarterly comp at 4.1%, and discretionary comp was strong at 14.6%. On our March call, I discussed the challenge and opportunity to enhance the discretionary performance at Family Dollar through improved product assortment, sharper price points and greater values. Customers are noticing and they are responding. \n In Q3, discretionary, as a percent of our net sales at Family Dollar, increased 140 basis points to 21.5% of sales. Our discretionary grew 2x faster than the total market in Q3. During the quarter, we launched the ability to sell product directly on our website at familydollar.com, providing customers another way to access great values. Additionally, we are early in the test phases of the following initiatives: buy online, pick up at store; and delivery options through Instacart and Shipt. There will be more to come on future calls. \n As I mentioned on our call 3 months ago, it's a new day at Family Dollar. I continue to be very pleased with the team's overall progress. We are 3 quarters into 2020 with an operating margin of 5.1% compared to 2% 3 quarters into 2019. The key elements of our improvement plan include: improved merchandising and marketing, raising stock and raising store in-stocks, upgrading brand standards, creating a selling culture and refining our format strategy. \n I would also like to recognize Dollar Tree Canada. Our Canada President and Chief Operating Officer, Neil Curran and his team are hitting on all cylinders. During Q3, Dollar Tree Canada opened 2 new stores, bringing the total to 230 stores north of the border. Canada exceeded its plan of sales, gross margin and operating income, delivering low double-digit comps in both consumables and discretionary, including very strong seasonal sales on Fall Harvest and Halloween, and they have improved on store manager turnover and internal promotion as a result of their continued focus on people development. \n Regarding real estate, the team completed more than 550 projects in the quarter, including 143 new stores, 34 relocations, 371 Family Dollar H2 renovations, and we had 16 store closings. We ended the quarter with 15,606 stores. \n I'll now toss it to Kevin to provide more detail on the Q3 performance. Thanks, Kevin. We certainly have momentum in our business. For Q3 in a challenging retail environment with government stimulus mostly behind us, we delivered very solid enterprise results, including a positive 5.1% comp, 150 basis points of gross margin improvement and 130 basis points of operating margin improvement despite incurring more than $46 million in COVID-related costs. Additionally, we completed more than 550 real estate projects, paid down the $500 million drawn on our revolving line of credit and repurchased $200 million in stock. Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to grow the business and create shareholder value. \n It is still very early, but I am encouraged by our start to the current quarter. We are just over 3 weeks into our important fourth quarter, and we are off to a very good start with same-store sales at both banners currently tracking above reported third quarter levels. We are truly leveraging the power of both brands. Actions taken in 2019, including the consolidation of store support centers and the alignment of organizational leadership under one team are paying off. Examples include: we are experiencing improved accessibility to a broader base of manufacturers and vendors by going to market as a 15,000-plus store chain. Many vendors are willing to work with us to support both the dollar price points as well as price points above the dollar. Our merchant teams are harmonized to act with clarity, focus and speed. \n When the first COVID wave hit in March, we took action to derisk the Halloween season and actually saw the best sell-through in company history. This fall, we modified our assortments away from the traditional cold and allergy and to more focus on health products, vitamins and face covering. We also made strategic buys on paper, soaps and sanitizers to get ahead of the curve as COVID cases were expected to pick up in the second wave. \n Our seasonal businesses, both at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are doing very well. We are able to be a convenient shopping trip to meet the needs of those staying at home, eating at home, working at home and/or learning at home. We are seeing greater sales of seasonal product as it hits our stores. Customers are buying ahead and not waiting until the last minute. This is resulting in better sell-through and reduced markdown exposure. We will continue to develop new strategic store formats so we are able to better serve our customers while improving store productivity, margins and returns. We want formats that utilize the best of both brands to serve customers in all types of geographic markets. This will be a story of evolution, change and improvement.\n Our gross margin return on investment or GMROI at Family Dollar is the highest it has been since we have owned the business. This is a combination of improved sales, gross margin and inventory returns. An example is our apparel category where we delivered a significant improvement in sales and margin with material-less inventory. This is while the overall market has been down for apparel. We are focused on delivering the basics at greater values, sharper price points. The team has undergone a significant amount of work to get us to this stage with one consolidated store support center, a strong balance sheet and an aligned, energized and focused leadership team and a full staff of talented retailers. We believe we have the ability to better serve customers across North America.\n Our actions represent a transformational opportunity to leverage the power of both of our brands through flexible store formats designed to drive operational results and enhance shareholder value. Before we go to your questions, I'd like to wish all of our stakeholders, a safe and happy holiday season. I believe we are all looking forward to the arrival of 2021. It's almost here.\n Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Thanks for the question. Yes. So quarter-to-date, we are seeing some of the stack up right now. It's not quite at the level as it was back in March and April. We're estimating at about 30% of the rate it was earlier in the year, but we can see that they are stocking up now. And the seasonal pull-through is some pull-forward sales. We do see they are buying earlier and decorating their homes, and that's really helping us a lot in our sell-through. We have less markdowns and so there's less exposure there and ability to get more product out on our sales floor. \n Regarding Dollar Tree Plus!, while I know it seems like it takes long, but this is really -- it's similar to other tests that we have. When we have our Crafters Square, we tested it in 3 or 4 stores, then we put it out into 800 stores and then rolled it out. And now we're rolling out to the chain and that took probably 18 months to 2 years. It's just that we didn't show you all the backdrop of the early testing. And we took the same pace as we were looking in our snack zones at Dollar Tree. We tested that for a year in stores and refined it and then rolled it out to a certain amount of stores and then began our process. \n So this is what we're doing, the same process. We want to make sure it's right and aligned, and we've even learned a lot from our process by shifting a lot from consumables into the discretionary items that the customer really wants that we can bring great value in. And it also takes our buyers' time to go -- these are import items and we actually manufacture and create these items to be a great value and a wild factor at the $3 and $5 price point. So we want to make sure it's the right thing, and it's adding value to our customers and to our company as well. Yes. Well, I think the first answer is that we're organizing around the strategy. So that tells you that there is commitment there that we want to find great products at the $3 and $5 price points, and it gives us the ability to also leverage that across both banners where it makes sense. And the 500 is, it gives us -- we're actually rolling it out to more distribution stores and we look at stores that are sized appropriate, where we can bring this product into those stores. So 500 is an estimate of stores around those distribution centers. And it also gives us enough stores to really see how it continues to grow and improve and how our customers respond. \n We like the results. We can tell that the sales are growing compared to when the sales of the consumable items, they're reacting more. So the overall sales of these items are growing. The challenge we have is, in the backdrop of the COVID with all the increase in sales and mix of the stores that how it shifted, it's really hard for us to isolate those specific categories in those stores. But it's easy enough there's enough evidence that the sales of those specific categories are doing well enough, and our customers are responding, that we're going to continue to roll it out and test it more. The things that we do like is even in the seasonal items, where the $3 and $5 items are really responding well and seasonal. Well, I think the #1 thing that we could see is the sales are up over the program when it was consumables. So we think that they're responding favorably because the products that we are buying are selling through at the rate we expect and it's continuing to grow. Thanks, Matt. Yes. In my opinion, I see it similar to the Dollar Tree, low single-digit, continued growth year after year in comp store sales growth. I think both banners should be able to settle into that with no problem. Regarding the new customers, we -- what we're seeing is just overall, it's very similar to new and old, as I shared in the prepared remarks that when the customers are coming into the store, they are shopping with intent. And what we do like to see is they're shopping the entire store in the discretionary side that we are working so hard on to fill that basket, and we're seeing our discretionary side grow with both new and old customers. Matt, we're all looking forward to 2021. I think -- the way I think about it, I do think that customers, the dynamic in their shopping patterns have changed, and I think it's going to be slow to change. I don't think there's going to be a light switch that's going to turn on and all of a sudden, they'll go back to their old shopping patterns and activity. I think we will keep going after driving that basket size, and when they are in our stores, drive it with intent. Yes, thanks for the question. It's a great question. We think it's critical. And especially after this year, as you've seen by others and how the customer is really moving into the omnichannel and using that. So we definitely are going to build that capability at both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. And like we have organized around our Dollar Tree Plus!, we are organizing around our omnichannel business as well. We've got a new leader there, who's got great experience, and we will accelerate our capabilities. Yes, it's really early. We launched it mid- to late quarter. I would say, we really like the basket size. We like the product that they are buying inside the basket, and we're excited about offering that opportunity to our customers as they shift in some of their behaviors. The beautiful thing is, we've got -- we are 15,000 store chains, and we're conveniently located in their neighborhoods and close to their stores. And then when we combine that with their ability, should they want to buy online or pick up in store or get it delivered at home, we're going to have that capability as well. But it's really early for us, but we do like the basket we're seeing and the mix of the product. Yes, that's a good question because we think about that a lot. And as a minimum, as you can imagine, the state minimum wages are all over the Board, and it's hard for me to -- it would be a different number by state and geography, but there are probably 6 to 7 states already on their path to that $15 an hour minimum wage that they've announced several years ago, and they're on their path to that. \n So our operating teams are absolutely working on driving, first and foremost, in-store efficiencies. You look at -- if you can bring in technology and self-scanning to help leverage some of your resources that way. Our merchants continue to look at merchandising methods through shelf-ready PEQs and then distribution methods. I mean, those are our 3 levers that we can pull: our operators in the store, technology, distribution and the product our merchants are buying are all the things that we actively are going to be working on. Yes, Mike, thanks for your question on the DT Plus!. As I shared earlier, right now, when you look at relative performance to other stores or prior the challenge we have is when we change to our 2.0 and brought in all our discretionary, it landed right in March. So there was so much noise around other stores and/or themselves that is really hard for us to determine the lift that was associated specifically to these products. And remember, the linear footage, it's still 10% to 11% of the total store. So it's hard to see what this is doing. \n But the 2 things we do see, we like the sales that these are -- the product that we're putting in there at the $3 and $5 price point are selling. It's also selling at a much higher-margin because it's discretionary product, and we're able to manufacture these products and bring value to the customer. And then the third thing we can see is the basket size. When one of these items are in the basket, it is twice the basket size when they're not in there. Those are the things that we can see, and it gives us courage to keep moving forward, and we're going to keep on fueling it. Scot, thanks for the questions. I'll answer the first, the consumable. We are chasing the product and the national brand, and it's the products that our COVID related and manufacturers are still trying to build up capacity. And it's in the paper, the hand sanitizers, the wipes and some consumable-related products. So we -- the inventory levels are improving from April, but they are still not caught up with the demand. So yes, we're still chasing a little bit of that and there's still some upside capacity there. Yes. And just a little bit more color on -- just a little bit more color on that. Our merchants have worked really hard at providing a much better value at sharper price points and it met the need for the last several months, as Kevin just described. So that is going to be going forward. Our merchants are going to continue to buy better, buy basics and buy great value and supply that to the customer from this point forward. Yes. So the first one, the reason we're rolling it out, no, we're not limited by proximity to the DCs at all. It's really about bringing in these products into a DC, so you're bringing in and creating slots for the different items. And we're going to do our due diligence and roll this out and test. And the store size was really more related to -- we do not want to impact our single price point assortment that the customers used to in our stores. So we're looking for size of stores right now during the test that doesn't adversely impact that assortment. So that's the only reason we're doing that. \n And then -- yes, on your question on the $2 and $4, we're looking for great value at great products. And the $3 and $5 price points seem to resonate more with our customers, and it differentiates itself from the Dollar price point. And we don't want to muddy the water with those in between products. We want to really focus on step changing items that we're selling for $3 and $5 that are really $7 and $10 items anywhere else in retail. So I want to -- we're trying to bring clarity to ourselves, to our merchants and for our customers on the value. I do not have that right now with me. Well, we can -- Randy can get that for you. Yes. So I mean, so the obvious one, if it impacts -- if we had adverse implications to comp store sales in the stores and/or margin dollars, and it's not accretive to the business. I mean, that's what we're really looking for is that it's -- this program has to be accretive to sales margin and operating income and that's what our expectations are. I'm sorry, what was the question? I can't remember one to this level, no. We've got certainly a lot of tests out there that we never went forward with, but no, not to this level. Yes, that's a great question. But first and foremost, it was a positive low single digits. So we continue to grow our consumable sales. And 9 months ago in March, we were talking about how consumable has always been healthy for the Family Dollar business, and I foresee that continuing to grow. And we're going to keep doing the same thing as we are on the discretionary side. \n We're bringing great values. We're going to have the right assortment. We're going to sharpen our price points to be competitive in the marketplace. And we are chasing the inventory. I would say on the consumable side, we are not happy with our everyday in-store stocks on consumables. So we believe that we can build that business going forward."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Dollar Tree, Inc. Second Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Guiler, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the second fiscal quarter of 2020. With me on today's call will be our President and CEO, Mike Witynski; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler. \n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent 8-K, 10-Q and annual report, which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so. \n At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Please limit your questions to 1 and 1 related follow-up question, if necessary. \n Now I will turn the call over to Mike Witynski, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer. \nMichael Witynski: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. \n I'm very pleased with the company's second quarter results announced this morning. Our store and distribution center teams have done a remarkable job of serving customers through an incredibly dynamic time in retail. Their continued efforts to ensure we are providing a clean, safe shopping experience, along with great value and convenience our stores offer, contributed to our solid operating performance for the quarter. \n Our team delivered an earnings per share increase of 44.7% compared to prior year's quarter. These results for the enterprise were comprised of a 7.2% same-store sales increase, a 180 basis points improvement in gross profit margin and a 130 basis point increase in operating profit margin. Same-store sales increased 11.6% at Family Dollar and 3.1% at Dollar Tree. \n It's a new day at Family Dollar. In early March, on our Q4 earnings call and following our December leadership realignment, I spoke about the challenge and opportunity to turn around discretionary side of the business at Family Dollar. Our focus is on greater values and sharper price points with an enhanced focus on meeting the basic needs of our customers. It's all about sourcing more of the items customers want to buy. \n Our team's efforts are paying off as Family Dollar delivered a record 28.9% same-store sales increase and discretionary for the quarter. Our realigned and focused merchandising team is demonstrating how they can be nimble and opportunistic to drive sales, loyalty and repeat visits at Family Dollar. Examples of this included, following on the success we experienced at Dollar Tree, we have now completed the rollout of Hallmark-branded greeting cards to all Family Dollar stores. \n We are capitalizing on great brand name closeout opportunities, which is a relatively new approach at Family Dollar. We introduced what could be the top toy of the year, Baby Yoda, and sold tens of thousands in a matter of days. As the quarter progressed, we saw a shift from kitchenware and tabletop into more home decor and soft home as customers are investing in their homes and spending more time in their homes. Anything related to staying at home, such as lawn and garden and outdoor grilling, continues to perform very well. And on the apparel side, we have had strong sell-through of our spring and summer apparel with a focus on our at-home items like loungewear, sleepwear, slippers, athleisure, children's clothing as well as newborn and onesies. \n Family Dollar's 11.6% comp reflected the continuation of momentum that we saw in Q1 as customers are viewing Family Dollar as a convenient, safe, local option with great values on food, essentials, household products, cleaning supplies, home decor and much, much more. The strong performance in discretionary contributed 390 basis points improvement in gross margin, and operating income margin for Family Dollar in Q2 increased 470 basis points to 5.3%. \n Other Family Dollar sales highlights for the second quarter included the 11.6% same-store sales increase was on top of a 2.4% comp in Q2 a year ago. This was comprised of 25.9% increase in average ticket, which was partially offset by an 11.3% decline in transaction count as customers continue to consolidate their shopping trips. \n The sales strength was broad-based geographically, with each zone delivering comp increases between 9.5% and 13.5%. Also, both rural and urban Family Dollar stores delivered double-digit comp increases, with rural slightly outpacing urban. Regarding the cadence of comps, each month's increase was greater than 8.5%, with May, which had the greatest benefits of stimulus, being the strongest month. And June was slightly stronger than July. While it is still early in Q3, Family Dollar is delivering very solid same-store sales despite less government assistance being available than during the prior quarter. \n The consumables side of the business delivered another positive quarterly comp at 6.3%. While as previously mentioned, the discretionary count was a record 28.9%. We saw more than 0.25 million new sign-ups in our smart coupon program during the quarter, bringing its total enrollment to 12.8 million customers. \n Our H2 stores continue to perform very well, delivering year 1 cap lifts greater than 10% when compared to non-renovated stores. For fiscal 2020, as previously stated, we plan to renovate 750 Family Dollar stores while new stores are also being open in the H2 format. \n For the Dollar Tree segment, Dollar Tree bounced back with a 3.1% same-store sales increase for Q2 following a quarter where Easter seasonal performance was materially impacted by COVID-19. Gross margin, which was down 260 basis points year-over-year in Q1, was down 10 basis points for the second quarter. This sequential improvement was primarily due to the rebound on the discretionary side of the business following Easter. \n Geographically, comp sales were relatively balanced with increases by zone ranging from 1.2% to 4.25%. For the quarter, discretionary delivered a positive 9% comp, and consumables were down approximately 3%. The comp sales for every line of business at Dollar Tree improved from quarter 1 to quarter 2, with the exception of the food category. Factors impacting food include reduced availability of protein products from periodic plant shutdowns, slowed sales of impulse snacks as traffic has declined, and some vendors are focusing more on larger pack sizes based on demand and their production capacity. Categories performed well in the quarter include crafts, kitchenware, housework products, party celebrations, and beauty and eyewear. \n The Crafter's Square program is a tremendous hit with our customers and is driving repeat visits to our stores. Our timing with the rollout of more than 2,400 stores in Q1 could not have been better. The improved performance in the basic craft assortment is also contributing to a lift in our seasonal craft business as well. \n For the quarter, Dollar Tree's transaction count was down 15.9%, while average ticket increased 22.6% as consumers, in general, have been shopping less, but buying more. Q3 has gotten off to a good start at Dollar Tree as well. \n Regarding upcoming seasons, like back-to-school, Fall Harvest and Halloween, we are seeing more volatility than usual on the timing of back-to-school sales. But the good news is these are in line categories, and there is minimal markdown risk associated with these items. I view this as similar as the graduation category. The timing of the sales were disrupted, but, overall, the category performed very well for us. Consumers are adapting to the current environment, and are still celebrating, albeit in smaller groups or celebrating in different ways. \n In March, the merchant team took action to make adjustments in Halloween buys and derisk the category, much less focus on traditional trick or treating and large gatherings and more focus on decorations and customs. We are seeing very nice trends regarding the early sales related to Fall Harvest and Halloween. \n Now regarding Dollar Tree Plus! Our focus on selling great value merchandise at price points of $5 and below, we are continuing to analyze, learn and make adjustments to the program. Earlier this year, we transitioned from the initial consumable-dominated assortment to more of a wild-type discretionary products that Dollar Tree is known for. We recently added bins to our larger test stores to promote some hot, one-time item sales. Sales of these discretionary products remained strong with good sell-through as customers are responding favorably. We are excited about the many new, multi-price discretionary products that we already have on the store shelves for this fall selling season. We remain encouraged about the potential for Dollar Tree Plus!.\n Inventory levels in both our segments were impacted during the quarter as it relates to higher turned consumable categories. Current environment and related in-stock levels on domestic items are improving, but the continuation of high customer demand, especially on items such as paper towels and cleaning supplies, is still outpacing both vendor production, capacity and the supply. In-stock levels on certain items are constrained, but we do expect to see continued improvement as we move through the quarter. \n Throughout the quarter, we rewarded our dedicated hourly store and distribution center associates with premium pay. This was in recognition for their extraordinary efforts to protect and serve our customers effectively with enhanced cleaning protocols and other safety measures. We believe these efforts contributed to our solid top line sales performance during the quarter. The value and convenience of our stores' offer is desired in the current environment by customers who are looking to save money while shopping close to home. \n The COVID-19-related costs incurred for wage premiums for the frontline associates, our guaranteed sales bonuses for field management and the supplies needed for keeping our customers, associates and facilities safe totaled nearly $135 million for the quarter. \n Surveys indicate that customers want to shop where they feel comfortable and safe. We have invested in our associates and believe this is contributing to enhance loyalty, attendance while reducing turnover in our stores. Over time, lower turnover can lead to improved shopper experience, more efficient store operations and reduced shrink. \n During the quarter, we went to re-rank Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, first, an aggregate of strongly trusted or somewhat trusted ratings of all retailers, enforcing safety measures for shoppers. \n Additionally, as many of you have seen in the news reports, more than 100 of our stores were impacted in certain communities during the recent periods of civil unrest. Overall, we incurred nearly $17 million in costs during the quarter related to store damages, repairs and lost inventory. The majority of the impacted stores have been reopened. \n Regarding our supply chain, we continue to support planned growth and infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We recently began shipping from our newest distribution centers in Rosenberg, Texas and Ocala, Florida. These facilities will provide increased capacity and improved efficiencies to support continued profitable store growth in both Southeastern and Southwestern states. We completed more than 250 real estate projects in the quarter, including 131 new stores, 22 relocations, 76 Family Dollar H2 renovations and 26 store closings. We ended the quarter with 15,479 stores. \n I am very proud of the work our leaders throughout the organization, including our store operations and field leadership teams, our merchandising group, our DC and supply chain teams and our store support center team. \n I'll toss it over to Kevin now to provide more detail for the Q2 performance. \nKevin Wampler: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. \n For the second quarter, consolidated net sales increased 9.4% to $6.28 billion, comprised of $3.18 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.1 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 7.2%. And on a segment basis, comps for Family Dollar increased 11.6% and for Dollar Tree increased 3.1%. \n Overall, gross profit increased 16.2% to $1.92 billion. Gross margin improved 180 basis points to 30.5% compared to 28.7% in Q2 of 2019. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased approximately 10 basis points to 33.7% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included distribution costs increased 70 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. This includes the start-up expenses of the 2 new distribution centers that Mike mentioned as well as approximately $6.7 million or 20 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay bonuses and health screening costs. \n Shrink increased approximately 15 basis points based on inventory results and an increase in the accrual rate. These cost increases were partially offset by improved merchandise costs, including freight, which improved by approximately 65 basis points. Dollar Tree saw an improvement in merchandise mix, lower freight costs as a percentage of sales and improved markdown, partially offset by an incremental $8.2 million of tariff costs. Occupancy cost decreased 15 basis points due to leverage on the comp sales increase in the quarter. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 390 basis points to 27.2% in the second quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, improved 190 basis points, primarily due to improved merchandise mix. Discretionary sales, driven by government assistance and improved assortment, comped up 28.9% for the quarter, increasing total discretionary sales to 26.2% of the business from 22.9% last year. And traditionally, the Family Dollar segment had improved mark on and lower freight cost as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by $2.6 million of incremental tariffs. \n Occupancy costs decreased approximately 95 basis points as a result of leverage from the comp sales increase. Markdown expense improved approximately 85 basis points as we cycled the store optimization markdowns and higher clearance sales from the prior year's quarter and lower promotional activity in the current year, partially offset by $7 million of markdown costs for stores affected by civil unrest. \n Shrink decreased approximately 40 basis points based on improved inventory results in the current year and an increase in the accrual rate during the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by distribution costs, which increased approximately 25 basis points due to increased payroll costs at the DCs. These costs included approximately $4.7 million or 15 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay bonuses and health screening costs. \n The consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 50 basis points to 24.5% of net sales compared to 24% in Q2 a year ago. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales increased to 24% compared to 22.4% in Q2 of 2019. Payroll costs increased approximately 175 basis points comprised of the following. Payroll expenses increased approximately $66 million or approximately 210 basis points for costs associated with COVID-19 premium pay and bonuses. This increase was partially offset by decreases in workers' compensation and benefit costs as well as leverage from the comp sales increase. \n Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 5 basis points. The company incurred COVID costs of $3.5 million or approximately 10 basis points for PPE and cleaning supply. Additionally, general liability claim expense increased based on development, partially offset by lower legal and travel costs. So our facility costs decreased approximately 10 basis points, primarily due to leverage of the stronger same-store sales and a lower electric costs. \n The SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 85 basis points to 21.9% compared to 22.7% for the second quarter of 2019. Operating expenses decreased by approximately 90 basis points, primarily due to higher costs in the prior year related to the disposal of fixed assets in connection with the store optimization plan and reduced advertising and travel as a percentage of net sales in the current year as well as leverage from the comparable store sales increase. \n Store facility costs have improved approximately 25 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales and lower electric costs. And depreciation improved 5 basis points, primarily from leverage on the comp sales increase. These benefits were partially offset by payroll expenses, which increased approximately 40 basis points, driven by COVID-19 cost of $48.2 million or 155 basis points for premium payment bonuses, an increase in incentive compensation based on performance. These increases were partially offset by decreases in workers' compensation, benefit costs and temporary health and leverage from comp sales. \n Operating income increased 39.4% to $374.9 million compared with $268.9 million in the same period last year. And operating income margin improved 130 basis points to 6% compared to last year's second quarter. The current year quarter included $134.9 million in COVID-19-related expenses and $16.8 million in civil unrest costs. Nonoperating expenses totaled $35 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense. \n Our effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 21.1% in the prior year second quarter. The company had net income of $261.5 million or $1.10 per diluted share, which included $134.9 million or $0.44 per diluted share of incremental operating costs for COVID-19-related expenses and $16.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share for civil unrest costs. This compared to a net earnings of $180.3 million or $0.76 per share in the prior year's quarter. \n Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.75 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. The company paid down $250 million on its revolver during the quarter. Outstanding debt as of August 1, 2020, was approximately $4.1 billion, which includes $500 million drawn on our revolving line of credit. \n Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end declined 4.2% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 4.9%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 8.7%. The team is actively managing the mix of inventory to build food and essential goods categories. \n Inventory for Family dollar at quarter end decreased 7% for the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 0.6%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 7.6%. Our Family Dollar inventory reflects higher-than-normal out of stocks in certain categories. Our merchants, supply chain and vendors continue to work to improve our position to meet increased product demands. \n Capital expenditures were $232.5 million in the second quarter versus $293.3 million in Q2 of last year. And for fiscal 2020, we continue to expect consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $168.1 million for Q2 compared to $155.1 million in the second quarter last year. And for fiscal 2020, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $675 million to $680 million. \n While we are not providing sales and EPS guidance, I do want to provide a few data points for your modeling. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $38 million in Q3 and $152 million for fiscal 2020. The tax rate is expected to be 22.4% for the third quarter and 22.6% for fiscal 2020. And weighted average diluted share counts are soon to be 238.3 million shares for Q3 and 238.1 million shares for the full year. \n As demonstrated by the significant business trend changes between Q1 and Q2, the environment remains volatile. We have always valued the flexibility of our business model, and we continue to adapt as necessary during these uncertain period. We have a strong balance sheet and continue to grow the company by investing in new and renovated stores, our supply chain and technology to improve the customer experience. We remain confident in our business and our ability to drive long-term shareholder value. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thanks, Kevin. \n I could not be more proud of the overall team's performance for the second quarter. As I stated earlier, it is a new day at Family Dollar. Family Dollar delivered a 13.6% comp for the first half of the year, and operating margin has improved 350 basis points from the first half a year ago. We have seen nice momentum thus far in Q3. \n Dollar Tree had a good quarter with sequential improvement in both sales and margin, following a very challenging Q1. Aside from the food category, we saw comp improvement in every line of the business in the second quarter. \n I believe we are at the right spot at the right time. We have a business teams consolidated into one store support center. Our leadership teams are aligned, focused and energized. Our support teams are receiving consistent direction and are acting with enhanced clarity, focus and speed. Our merchant teams are doing a tremendous job of adapting and reacting to evolving customer trends, and our store operators are focused on running great, clean, safe stores. \n At Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive sales, enhance gross margins and leverage our cost structure, each contributing to operating margin improvements over time. We are a growth company in the most attractive sector in retail, opening more stores, renovating stores, improving our efficiencies, generating significant free cash flow, focusing on our customers and running great businesses. I truly believe the best is still ahead of us. \n Before we go into Q&A, I would like to just share that our thoughts are with all of our families and communities and our associates that have been with and are being impacted by Hurricane Laura that is passing through the Louisiana and Texas area right now. \n Operator, we are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Mike, congrats on the new role. Maybe while early, any change in the key areas of focus as we think about Dollar Tree and the Family Dollar banners? And maybe specifically, how are you thinking about multi-price points at Dollar Tree? Where do we stand today? And what key metrics are you looking forward to potentially scale this initiative? \nMichael Witynski: Matt, thanks for your interest. Regarding the multi-price point at Dollar Tree, we are very interested and excited about the opportunity. We're going to -- especially as we moved into the more discretionary and wow factor that Dollar Tree is known for, we're seeing good response from our customers as we provide exciting products for them. And we're going to continue to watch it, not the key metrics that we're watching. We're going to continue to watch, are our customers responding to a favorably? Are we getting more productivity out of that 4-wall box? So we want sales per square foot to go up. And we want to enhance our margins. I mean, those are the 3 things that we'll be looking at to determine if it's successful as we continue to enhance it. \n On the Family Dollar side, we will continue. We think that, that 11.7% comp is -- just confirms that our customers are appreciating the investment we're making in our H2. They're responding favorably. And Rick and the merchant teams, too, that 18 months ago, we focused a lot on rolling out the H2. In the last 6 months, with Rick in charge, he's really working on refining that the H2 assortment. As you always have continuous improvement, we're looking at adjacencies, SKU count. How do you expand in discretionary side? So while we're rolling out that H2, the merchants are working on that continuous improvement that will get us more sales per square foot and more margin by getting our discretionary mix stronger. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then, Kevin, at the Dollar Tree banner, what's the best way to think about the gross margin headwinds versus tailwinds in the back half of the year, maybe relative to the second quarter? And then as we think about the 35% to 36% banner gross margin long term, that I think you are very confident, with any constraints to getting to that level next year, that we should think about? \nKevin Wampler: Thanks for the question, Matt. I think as we think about it, obviously, we saw things balance out in Q2 a little bit. And again, we saw some nice improvement in our overall margin. Again, discretionary mix grew in Q2 and balanced things back out from where we were in Q1. As we look to the back half of the year, I believe we're set up for a strong discretionary run. I think, as Mike mentioned early on, we're seeing good sales in Fall Harvest and Halloween, which bodes well, and we'll continue to build the categories back up on the food and essential side. But as I look at it in general, I think as we talked about, maybe our biggest headwind as we go to the back half is our distribution costs. We talked about it being up 70 basis points in Q2. And again, what we did have in there is start-up costs for 2 new buildings, which is the first time in a long, long time, many, many years, we've had 2 buildings opening up at the same time. So there are a lot of start-up costs that go into that and add to that. \n But again, I think that's where the pressure is. Shrink is -- continue to be a little bit stubborn, but I do believe we can get our arms around that. And -- but -- so I think really, as I look at it, if we can drive some additional sales, create some more leverage, we feel pretty good about the natural product margin side. The commodity side of the business still feel like it's in a pretty good place. Our buyers completed their July trip in a sense from here in the states, but feel good about the way that trip went and how that will affect us as we continue to go forward. So I think that's kind of how I'm thinking about the second half in the Dollar Tree segment. \nMichael Witynski: Matt, just to give a little color, too, on your question, getting to the 35% to 36%. We absolutely believe we can get to that range that we historically have. As Kevin said, we like the mix that can drive us there. And if you really look at our initial markdown from a product and mix perspective, we're in great shape. Our pressure is from the shrink and the DC costs. We know where it is, and we're going to get after those areas. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: On the Family Dollar side, first, why do you think the spread between Family Dollar and its largest competitor in terms of comps expanded this quarter versus where it had been in the last several quarters? And as part of that, your consumable business was very good that drove gross margin expansion. Are you going to give some of that back? And this is not a realistic gross margin to expect that we should be modeling moving forward? \nMichael Witynski: Michael, thanks for the question. We're very proud of and like our 11.7% comp growth and especially a record 28.9% growth on the discretionary side. We're seeing that on the Family Dollar side, based on the information that we're getting from third parties and internal, that we captured 15% new customers during the quarter. Our discretionary market share gains were 3x what the market was on the discretionary side of the business. And with our 250,000 new sign-ups on our smart coupons, we are getting new customers engaged. So we like our comp sales growth. And all the things that our merchants and the Rick McNeely and the team are focused on are the right things. They're responding. And that focus to sharper price points, basic items and having what customers need when they're in our store, we think, is working. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. And my follow-up is, you provided some comments around what you've been seeing early into the third quarter, which is important because there's still a lot of folks, who are out of work, and you guys provide great value to them, but yet their unemployed insurance has -- or their enhanced benefits have worn out. So you mentioned that Dollar Tree is off to a good start. Is it cool if we assume that, that business has accelerated from where it was last quarter? Just given that you've addressed some of the out of stocks and other issues in that in the consumable categories? And should we also assume that Family Dollar is seeing similar trends to what you reported in July? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. We believe we like the third quarter, and we think the third quarter is starting just like we ended the second quarter. We've got strong comp store sales. We like the mix on both sides of the business. And as Kevin said, early indicators on fall and Halloween are strong, and we think we're well positioned for that. We think, based on what we're seeing from the customer, since they're spending more time at home, they want to decorate their homes and invest in their homes more. So we're seeing those categories. So how -- we may be different, but with them spending more time at home, they're going to decorate that home since they're there. And we're seeing that in our sales. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. \nJohn Heinbockel: And Mike, let me start with your thoughts on Dollar Tree, right, and the discretionary business over the next, I don't know, 6 to 9 months, right? Because in '08, '09, you did see an acceleration on trading down as the recession took effect. What's your outlook when you think about Dollar Tree in the next couple of quarters? And are the merchants doing anything differently in anticipation of some trading down benefits? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. And I think we're well positioned on with our -- everybody is staying at home right now. Our Crafter's Square that are -- that we rolled out the first quarter, the 2,400 stores now and more than 3,000 stores. Our customers are responding very, very well. So our merchants are continuing to rebuy that and fulfill the drive and the demand in that category. And on the consumable side, we see -- every week and each period, we see the replenishment side getting better as vendors start to drive capacity. So we're -- we like the mix of sales going forward, and I think we're going to be in a good position in the back half of the year. And going into next year, especially when the customers are going to need us most, with the unemployment, the extra benefits going away and the unemployment rate where it is, we believe we're in a great position as we were in '08, '09, '10. \nJohn Heinbockel: All right. And then maybe secondly, you talked about the 2 DCs at Dollar Tree. So maybe a thought on where we are in co-mingling distribution, right, between the 2 banners. And I assume those 2 are going to be Dollar Tree-centric only, but where do we -- are we moving closer to more co-mingling to try to get the distribution cost down? Or is that a ways away? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, that's a great question. As you've seen, our DC costs are outpacing where we want them to be. So part of that is we do have a longer-term strategy to leverage our network. Currently, we are -- we have 1 co-banner DC in our St. George, Utah. But keep in mind, in the last 2, 2.5 years, every DC that we've opened or opening it with systems and the capability of co-bannering just as we have these 2. So we are starting out these 2 because that's where the growth historically has been on the Dollar Tree side, so we've been feeding that growth. But down in the Ocala business and the Texas, they are going to be capable of co-bannering. And in that long-term plan, we will be moving to that. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli. Can you provide some more color just regarding some of the supply shortages you highlighted, especially on the Dollar Tree side, and how you think that inventory flow will change as we get kind of further through the back half? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, Scot, thanks. And I would say on both sides, it's -- on the consumables side, it's really anything to do with paper and cleaning. So specifically, paper towels as people continue to enhance their protocols at home or wherever they're at with cleaning, any chemical with a kill claim, any hand sanitizer, there is still a lot of pressure on meeting the needs of the customer. But we do see the bath tissue, for instance, that is starting to improve. And actually, we can have that tissue on the shelf for more than just a couple of days. So I would say, throughout the back half of the year, we will see improvement in our in-stocks and those highly consumable items. But we are -- we have been communicated from vendors that this is a longer term -- there will be pressure on the back half of the year from our manufacturers. \nScot Ciccarelli: And Mike, do you guys have a -- I'm sorry. I was going to say, do you guys have an estimate for what the potential sales impact was or headwind that you faced during the quarter from these supply shortages? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. No, we -- not at the top of my head, we do not. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: Mike, I was hoping you could give a little more color on Dollar Tree and kind of what's going -- what you're seeing there. So the one question would be just the stimulus impact with some things rolling off at the end of the quarter and into this quarter. I know Dollar Tree is a much broader income demographic than Family Dollar. Anything you're seeing in the type of customer and how they're responding? Are you seeing some impacts on the stimulus side with the lower income customers buying less? \n And then the other question is just, can you help us, for yourselves and for the industry, think about this big decline. I think you guys said 16% decline in transactions at Dollar Tree. Like how are you guys thinking about the transaction comp playing out in the back half and how should we think about that? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Thanks for your question, Robby. So in Dollar Tree, we believe that the first half of the quarter in May, as we stated, was supported by the stimulus and the extra benefit dollars out there. But the great news is as those went away and as customers needed value and convenience and safety, they continue to shop at Dollar Tree and at Family Dollar. So we feel good about our comps towards the end of the quarter and going into the third quarter. And from the basket and transaction size, we are still seeing -- they are shopping with a purpose. When they come in, they are shopping and getting definitely driven a higher basket. So we think that will continue as we go into the fall as people continue to practice social distancing in the safety protocols as they should. \nRobert Ohmes: And Mike, as other stores came back online, because you guys obviously were a necessity retailer that's been open, but any changes you've had to make from a marketing standpoint or any pressures you've seen on either Family Dollar or Dollar Tree related to some of these other stores coming back online? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. We have not seen any noticeable difference. As I stated, at Family Dollar, our discretionary business, as customers came over other competitors opened up, we -- the market grew on the discretionary side but Family Dollar grew 3x back. So we're seeing that as competitors are opening up and more stores are opening, we did not see a noticeable difference in our traffic and/or basket. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Mike, congrats on the new position. My question is on Family Dollar. You talked about 15% new customer acquisition, I believe, in the quarter. Just wondering if you could just give us that metric for the first quarter. And then looking ahead, I'm curious what steps you're taking to retain those shoppers and cultivate those relationships over the next few quarters and even into next year. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Thanks, Chuck. I do not have that number for the first quarter. I think we can grab that, and Randy can get back to you. Regarding what we're doing to retain them is, a, provide a great shopping experience. Now more than ever, all the surveys and what we hear from our own customers is safety, cleanliness and convenience of getting in and out is very important to them, and then provide them what our strategy is on that. \n On the consumables side, we want to have the products that are looking for on the shelf. And on the discretionary side, our teams are continuing to work on those sharper price points with great value on basic needs. And we think doing those things and providing that when they're in our store, we'll keep retaining them. And then along with -- we like the increase of 0.25 million people signing up for our smart coupons. We think that we're going to be able to enable us to speak to those customers and watch what they're buying and keep driving basket size with them. \nCharles Grom: That's helpful. And then just bigger picture, like the Dollar Tree guys purchased Family Dollar 4 years ago, it's been a little bit of a struggle over the past few years. Just curious what you think needs to get done, not near term, but just bigger picture to fix the Family dollar business to narrow the gap with Dollar General to improve margins. Just what do you think needs to get done. \nMichael Witynski: I think it's a new day at Family Dollar. And I think the direction that this team is focused on right now, under Rick McNeely and the merchants, they are bringing clarity, focus on the right things, getting the right products. And I think it's evident by retaining more customers and driving an 11.7% comp and a 28.9% comp in our discretionary business. So I think those are the right things. \n And I think structurally, in our organization, we are all in one building now under one leader. And I think we've got the right leaders in place that can drive this strategy. So it's not only what is your focus on your strategy, but having the right people in place that can drive and execute that. And I'm more confident than ever that we've got the right team on the merchandising and the operations side to execute what we need. \n And I also I think as we -- with the 2 companies coming together, the discipline that Dollar Tree has and buying that wow and driving that cost and bringing that value into products, so embedded in our culture, we've also moved some people. So as we look at our structure, we have cross-pollinated some leaders. So we've got a great leader driving our discretionary side of the business that had many, many years of experience in Dollar Tree. So it's a combination of all being in one building, having a great strategy that our customers are responding to and then getting the right people in the chairs to execute the work. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: I wanted to go back to the discussion around EBIT margins. This quarter has -- came with some elevated expenses, right, particularly on the Dollar Tree side related to labor and other issues with the stores. If you are comping in the 3-plus percent range going forward, Kevin, how should we think about the ability to leverage overall expenses in the third quarter and second half? And just thinking about how to think about that go-forward algorithm of the business and ability to really flow down to the bottom line. \nKevin Wampler: Okay. Thanks, Paul. Yes, I think, obviously, to your point, if you -- obviously, we have invested in our associates around safety and premium pay. And obviously, from the standpoint, we do believe it's made a difference between, as Mike mentioned in his comments, attendance, turnover, various things that we think help us run a better store and hopefully keep people coming back, even though traffic doesn't really show -- it was really pretty stubborn in that 15% negative on the Dollar Tree side. Sans the COVID costs, obviously, operating income would have been up, EBIT would have been up. As we go into Q3, we put an 8-K out a few weeks ago that premium pay would continue for the first 4 weeks of August at a cost of about $18 million. And basically, that's less than it was. So we have lowered what the premium amount is. In our 10-Q that was filed this morning, we noted that, that premium pay will continue additional 4 weeks. And I think realistically, for any modeling, you should assume that it will be in place for the 13 weeks of the quarter of Q3. \n Again, we're going to also continue to obviously have expenses like anybody else for PPE and cleaning and sanitizing supplies. So that being said, it will be a headwind. It will be hard for -- I don't necessarily expect that Dollar Tree will show an improvement year-over-year in operating income or EBIT in Q3 because of that. So we've made that decision as a company that it makes all the sense in the world to reward these frontline workers and go through that. Now it will not last forever. And so these costs at some time -- at some point in time, will fall away. As we get into next year, you can expect these costs, I would think, to fall away to a certain degree, maybe not 100% because I'm sure we're going to still have cleaning protocols and various things. But because of that, that will be the headwind. \n I think if you look at the other operating lines, I mean, I think SG&A has been well controlled, otherwise. I think we're on the right track with getting our gross profit back to levels that we believe are where we should be and driving that back to that 35% to 36% range. So I think long term, the prognosis is very, very good. But obviously, we have these one-time costs currently. \n And realistically, what we don't know, another thing that's going to happen in Q3, I would expect there's going to be costs related to the hurricane at the end of the day that we can't put our arms around today. But obviously, we have many stores in the path of that storm, and I would expect that there'll be some damage and some dollars that will affect Q3 as well that we can't speak to beyond the fact that there'll be some when we report in November. \nPaul Trussell: And just wanted to also ask about your cash priorities and thought process. You do have an elevated amount of cash on the balance sheet today versus usual levels this time of the year, although some of that is related to what's drawn on the revolver. Just help us think about how are you thinking about leverage, store openings and remodels and share repurchases, which I think has been about a year since you've been engaged in that. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. So obviously, to your point, we did preemptively draw on the revolver in Q1 with the uncertainty of the pandemic. We've paid back $250 million of that $750 million draw. So at some point in time, we'll pay that $500 million back as well. The other thing we have due February 1, 2021, the $300 million legacy Family Dollar notes come due. So the plan would be to extinguish those notes at that point in time. That being said, we'll still have a nice cash position even with that. Obviously, we always want to support growth, and we continue to grow through new stores, renovations, supply chain technologies I spoke to. So those things will continue. We do have a share repurchase plan authorization out there. We have $800 million authorized and outstanding as we sit here. Obviously, we kind of put the brakes on that with the pandemic, but as things settle. Again, there's obviously some uncertainty as we go to the back half. Will there be a rebound in  the pandemic as we get into the fall and the flu season that comes with winter? So we'll keep our eye on those type of things and make some decisions as we enter the new year. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: I wanted to just go back a little bit to H2 remodels. It sounds like from a top line perspective, they continue to perform well. Wondering if you can expand a little bit more on the margin performance you're seeing there relative to the other stores. And is there any opportunity to kind of reaccelerate the remodels there? Or is there any logistical headwinds in accelerating that? Maybe you can just touch on that a little bit. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Kelly, thanks. I'll throw it to Kevin for the margin. But from a perspective of accelerating, so we're trying to do as many as we can given the current environment of travel restrictions and COVID restrictions in the state. So we've -- we're going to do 750. But absolutely, as soon as the states open up in the locations, and it's safe and we can get our third parties and our teams in there to do the remodels, we will absolutely open that back up and accelerate that. \nKevin Wampler: Speaking to the margins, obviously, as you look at the H2 model, there's some various components, right? So you have additional freezers and coolers, which is lower margin goods. More impulse/media consumption, which is a little bit higher margin. And then, obviously, an emphasis on seasonal. One of the things Mike spoke to earlier was the fact Rick and team really looking and continuing to improve that overall model, looking at the space we dedicated to discretionary. And how do we provide a probably even better discretionary assortment and relevant assortment within that box? But we like overall -- obviously, we'll get a nice sales lift. We get a nice overall driving more profit dollars at the end of the day. And then, obviously, it is our intention to drive a higher overall rate of profitability out of those stores. And we obviously are seeing that, but we think there's even more we can do with it. \nOperator: We'll take our last question from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Just a couple of questions on COVID cost. So you did call out that $18 million that will continue -- that we should assume continues for the whole quarter. Wondering if that also applies to the $4.5 million in manager bonuses. Should we assume that that's in place for the quarter? And then wondering if you could give the split between the Dollar Tree and the Family Dollar banner on those 2 components. And then I had one other follow-up. \nMichael Witynski: Okay. From an overall standpoint, from a banner perspective, the Dollar Tree segment incurred $76.6 million in Q2 and Family Dollar incurred $57.1 million, and, again, the vast majority of that being payroll costs at the end. And between -- and mainly stores, but obviously, there's a component there of DCs, which we broke out within the detail we gave you earlier today. So you have that piece of it. As far as the $4.5 million of manager bonuses, that does not continue necessarily directly. Those were above and beyond. And as we go forward, that does -- will probably not take place. But again, it's a very fluid situation. And so it's always open for change. But at this point, we do not expect that to necessarily continue. \nKaren Short: But take the $18 million and allocate it the same way between the $76 million and the $57.1 million that we saw throughout the quarter. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. I think that's reasonable because what you have to remember is we just -- we have an hour -- a larger hourly workforce population in the Dollar Tree banner than the Family Dollar banner. \nKaren Short: Great. Okay. And then, I guess, I'm still not totally clear what the message would be on the takeaway on Family Dollar comps in the current quarter. I know you said it's still solid. So should we assume that they are continuing at the level that we saw for the entire quarter in 2Q or too soon to tell? Or -- I mean, just curious if you can be a little more clear on that. \nMichael Witynski: Well, I think, Karen, as you think about it. So I think within the prepared remarks, we spoke a little bit about the cadence of comps for Family Dollar and the fact that the lowest quarter -- or excuse me, the lowest month within the quarter was roughly 8.5%. And the easiest way to think about it is there's been little degradation from that trend coming out of July. \nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Randy Guiler for closing remarks. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, and thank you for joining us on today's call and especially for your continued interest in Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss Q3 performance is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, November 24, 2020. Thank you, and have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Wampler",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning. \n For the second quarter, consolidated net sales increased 9.4% to $6.28 billion, comprised of $3.18 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.1 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 7.2%. And on a segment basis, comps for Family Dollar increased 11.6% and for Dollar Tree increased 3.1%. \n Overall, gross profit increased 16.2% to $1.92 billion. Gross margin improved 180 basis points to 30.5% compared to 28.7% in Q2 of 2019. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased approximately 10 basis points to 33.7% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included distribution costs increased 70 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. This includes the start-up expenses of the 2 new distribution centers that Mike mentioned as well as approximately $6.7 million or 20 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay bonuses and health screening costs. \n Shrink increased approximately 15 basis points based on inventory results and an increase in the accrual rate. These cost increases were partially offset by improved merchandise costs, including freight, which improved by approximately 65 basis points. Dollar Tree saw an improvement in merchandise mix, lower freight costs as a percentage of sales and improved markdown, partially offset by an incremental $8.2 million of tariff costs. Occupancy cost decreased 15 basis points due to leverage on the comp sales increase in the quarter. \n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 390 basis points to 27.2% in the second quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, improved 190 basis points, primarily due to improved merchandise mix. Discretionary sales, driven by government assistance and improved assortment, comped up 28.9% for the quarter, increasing total discretionary sales to 26.2% of the business from 22.9% last year. And traditionally, the Family Dollar segment had improved mark on and lower freight cost as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by $2.6 million of incremental tariffs. \n Occupancy costs decreased approximately 95 basis points as a result of leverage from the comp sales increase. Markdown expense improved approximately 85 basis points as we cycled the store optimization markdowns and higher clearance sales from the prior year's quarter and lower promotional activity in the current year, partially offset by $7 million of markdown costs for stores affected by civil unrest. \n Shrink decreased approximately 40 basis points based on improved inventory results in the current year and an increase in the accrual rate during the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by distribution costs, which increased approximately 25 basis points due to increased payroll costs at the DCs. These costs included approximately $4.7 million or 15 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay bonuses and health screening costs. \n The consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 50 basis points to 24.5% of net sales compared to 24% in Q2 a year ago. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales increased to 24% compared to 22.4% in Q2 of 2019. Payroll costs increased approximately 175 basis points comprised of the following. Payroll expenses increased approximately $66 million or approximately 210 basis points for costs associated with COVID-19 premium pay and bonuses. This increase was partially offset by decreases in workers' compensation and benefit costs as well as leverage from the comp sales increase. \n Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 5 basis points. The company incurred COVID costs of $3.5 million or approximately 10 basis points for PPE and cleaning supply. Additionally, general liability claim expense increased based on development, partially offset by lower legal and travel costs. So our facility costs decreased approximately 10 basis points, primarily due to leverage of the stronger same-store sales and a lower electric costs. \n The SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 85 basis points to 21.9% compared to 22.7% for the second quarter of 2019. Operating expenses decreased by approximately 90 basis points, primarily due to higher costs in the prior year related to the disposal of fixed assets in connection with the store optimization plan and reduced advertising and travel as a percentage of net sales in the current year as well as leverage from the comparable store sales increase. \n Store facility costs have improved approximately 25 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales and lower electric costs. And depreciation improved 5 basis points, primarily from leverage on the comp sales increase. These benefits were partially offset by payroll expenses, which increased approximately 40 basis points, driven by COVID-19 cost of $48.2 million or 155 basis points for premium payment bonuses, an increase in incentive compensation based on performance. These increases were partially offset by decreases in workers' compensation, benefit costs and temporary health and leverage from comp sales. \n Operating income increased 39.4% to $374.9 million compared with $268.9 million in the same period last year. And operating income margin improved 130 basis points to 6% compared to last year's second quarter. The current year quarter included $134.9 million in COVID-19-related expenses and $16.8 million in civil unrest costs. Nonoperating expenses totaled $35 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense. \n Our effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 21.1% in the prior year second quarter. The company had net income of $261.5 million or $1.10 per diluted share, which included $134.9 million or $0.44 per diluted share of incremental operating costs for COVID-19-related expenses and $16.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share for civil unrest costs. This compared to a net earnings of $180.3 million or $0.76 per share in the prior year's quarter. \n Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.75 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. The company paid down $250 million on its revolver during the quarter. Outstanding debt as of August 1, 2020, was approximately $4.1 billion, which includes $500 million drawn on our revolving line of credit. \n Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end declined 4.2% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 4.9%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 8.7%. The team is actively managing the mix of inventory to build food and essential goods categories. \n Inventory for Family dollar at quarter end decreased 7% for the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 0.6%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 7.6%. Our Family Dollar inventory reflects higher-than-normal out of stocks in certain categories. Our merchants, supply chain and vendors continue to work to improve our position to meet increased product demands. \n Capital expenditures were $232.5 million in the second quarter versus $293.3 million in Q2 of last year. And for fiscal 2020, we continue to expect consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $168.1 million for Q2 compared to $155.1 million in the second quarter last year. And for fiscal 2020, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $675 million to $680 million. \n While we are not providing sales and EPS guidance, I do want to provide a few data points for your modeling. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $38 million in Q3 and $152 million for fiscal 2020. The tax rate is expected to be 22.4% for the third quarter and 22.6% for fiscal 2020. And weighted average diluted share counts are soon to be 238.3 million shares for Q3 and 238.1 million shares for the full year. \n As demonstrated by the significant business trend changes between Q1 and Q2, the environment remains volatile. We have always valued the flexibility of our business model, and we continue to adapt as necessary during these uncertain period. We have a strong balance sheet and continue to grow the company by investing in new and renovated stores, our supply chain and technology to improve the customer experience. We remain confident in our business and our ability to drive long-term shareholder value. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. Thanks for the question, Matt. I think as we think about it, obviously, we saw things balance out in Q2 a little bit. And again, we saw some nice improvement in our overall margin. Again, discretionary mix grew in Q2 and balanced things back out from where we were in Q1. As we look to the back half of the year, I believe we're set up for a strong discretionary run. I think, as Mike mentioned early on, we're seeing good sales in Fall Harvest and Halloween, which bodes well, and we'll continue to build the categories back up on the food and essential side. But as I look at it in general, I think as we talked about, maybe our biggest headwind as we go to the back half is our distribution costs. We talked about it being up 70 basis points in Q2. And again, what we did have in there is start-up costs for 2 new buildings, which is the first time in a long, long time, many, many years, we've had 2 buildings opening up at the same time. So there are a lot of start-up costs that go into that and add to that. \n But again, I think that's where the pressure is. Shrink is -- continue to be a little bit stubborn, but I do believe we can get our arms around that. And -- but -- so I think really, as I look at it, if we can drive some additional sales, create some more leverage, we feel pretty good about the natural product margin side. The commodity side of the business still feel like it's in a pretty good place. Our buyers completed their July trip in a sense from here in the states, but feel good about the way that trip went and how that will affect us as we continue to go forward. So I think that's kind of how I'm thinking about the second half in the Dollar Tree segment. Okay. Thanks, Paul. Yes, I think, obviously, to your point, if you -- obviously, we have invested in our associates around safety and premium pay. And obviously, from the standpoint, we do believe it's made a difference between, as Mike mentioned in his comments, attendance, turnover, various things that we think help us run a better store and hopefully keep people coming back, even though traffic doesn't really show -- it was really pretty stubborn in that 15% negative on the Dollar Tree side. Sans the COVID costs, obviously, operating income would have been up, EBIT would have been up. As we go into Q3, we put an 8-K out a few weeks ago that premium pay would continue for the first 4 weeks of August at a cost of about $18 million. And basically, that's less than it was. So we have lowered what the premium amount is. In our 10-Q that was filed this morning, we noted that, that premium pay will continue additional 4 weeks. And I think realistically, for any modeling, you should assume that it will be in place for the 13 weeks of the quarter of Q3. \n Again, we're going to also continue to obviously have expenses like anybody else for PPE and cleaning and sanitizing supplies. So that being said, it will be a headwind. It will be hard for -- I don't necessarily expect that Dollar Tree will show an improvement year-over-year in operating income or EBIT in Q3 because of that. So we've made that decision as a company that it makes all the sense in the world to reward these frontline workers and go through that. Now it will not last forever. And so these costs at some time -- at some point in time, will fall away. As we get into next year, you can expect these costs, I would think, to fall away to a certain degree, maybe not 100% because I'm sure we're going to still have cleaning protocols and various things. But because of that, that will be the headwind. \n I think if you look at the other operating lines, I mean, I think SG&A has been well controlled, otherwise. I think we're on the right track with getting our gross profit back to levels that we believe are where we should be and driving that back to that 35% to 36% range. So I think long term, the prognosis is very, very good. But obviously, we have these one-time costs currently. \n And realistically, what we don't know, another thing that's going to happen in Q3, I would expect there's going to be costs related to the hurricane at the end of the day that we can't put our arms around today. But obviously, we have many stores in the path of that storm, and I would expect that there'll be some damage and some dollars that will affect Q3 as well that we can't speak to beyond the fact that there'll be some when we report in November. Yes. So obviously, to your point, we did preemptively draw on the revolver in Q1 with the uncertainty of the pandemic. We've paid back $250 million of that $750 million draw. So at some point in time, we'll pay that $500 million back as well. The other thing we have due February 1, 2021, the $300 million legacy Family Dollar notes come due. So the plan would be to extinguish those notes at that point in time. That being said, we'll still have a nice cash position even with that. Obviously, we always want to support growth, and we continue to grow through new stores, renovations, supply chain technologies I spoke to. So those things will continue. We do have a share repurchase plan authorization out there. We have $800 million authorized and outstanding as we sit here. Obviously, we kind of put the brakes on that with the pandemic, but as things settle. Again, there's obviously some uncertainty as we go to the back half. Will there be a rebound in  the pandemic as we get into the fall and the flu season that comes with winter? So we'll keep our eye on those type of things and make some decisions as we enter the new year. Speaking to the margins, obviously, as you look at the H2 model, there's some various components, right? So you have additional freezers and coolers, which is lower margin goods. More impulse/media consumption, which is a little bit higher margin. And then, obviously, an emphasis on seasonal. One of the things Mike spoke to earlier was the fact Rick and team really looking and continuing to improve that overall model, looking at the space we dedicated to discretionary. And how do we provide a probably even better discretionary assortment and relevant assortment within that box? But we like overall -- obviously, we'll get a nice sales lift. We get a nice overall driving more profit dollars at the end of the day. And then, obviously, it is our intention to drive a higher overall rate of profitability out of those stores. And we obviously are seeing that, but we think there's even more we can do with it."

            "name": "Michael Witynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. \n I'm very pleased with the company's second quarter results announced this morning. Our store and distribution center teams have done a remarkable job of serving customers through an incredibly dynamic time in retail. Their continued efforts to ensure we are providing a clean, safe shopping experience, along with great value and convenience our stores offer, contributed to our solid operating performance for the quarter. \n Our team delivered an earnings per share increase of 44.7% compared to prior year's quarter. These results for the enterprise were comprised of a 7.2% same-store sales increase, a 180 basis points improvement in gross profit margin and a 130 basis point increase in operating profit margin. Same-store sales increased 11.6% at Family Dollar and 3.1% at Dollar Tree. \n It's a new day at Family Dollar. In early March, on our Q4 earnings call and following our December leadership realignment, I spoke about the challenge and opportunity to turn around discretionary side of the business at Family Dollar. Our focus is on greater values and sharper price points with an enhanced focus on meeting the basic needs of our customers. It's all about sourcing more of the items customers want to buy. \n Our team's efforts are paying off as Family Dollar delivered a record 28.9% same-store sales increase and discretionary for the quarter. Our realigned and focused merchandising team is demonstrating how they can be nimble and opportunistic to drive sales, loyalty and repeat visits at Family Dollar. Examples of this included, following on the success we experienced at Dollar Tree, we have now completed the rollout of Hallmark-branded greeting cards to all Family Dollar stores. \n We are capitalizing on great brand name closeout opportunities, which is a relatively new approach at Family Dollar. We introduced what could be the top toy of the year, Baby Yoda, and sold tens of thousands in a matter of days. As the quarter progressed, we saw a shift from kitchenware and tabletop into more home decor and soft home as customers are investing in their homes and spending more time in their homes. Anything related to staying at home, such as lawn and garden and outdoor grilling, continues to perform very well. And on the apparel side, we have had strong sell-through of our spring and summer apparel with a focus on our at-home items like loungewear, sleepwear, slippers, athleisure, children's clothing as well as newborn and onesies. \n Family Dollar's 11.6% comp reflected the continuation of momentum that we saw in Q1 as customers are viewing Family Dollar as a convenient, safe, local option with great values on food, essentials, household products, cleaning supplies, home decor and much, much more. The strong performance in discretionary contributed 390 basis points improvement in gross margin, and operating income margin for Family Dollar in Q2 increased 470 basis points to 5.3%. \n Other Family Dollar sales highlights for the second quarter included the 11.6% same-store sales increase was on top of a 2.4% comp in Q2 a year ago. This was comprised of 25.9% increase in average ticket, which was partially offset by an 11.3% decline in transaction count as customers continue to consolidate their shopping trips. \n The sales strength was broad-based geographically, with each zone delivering comp increases between 9.5% and 13.5%. Also, both rural and urban Family Dollar stores delivered double-digit comp increases, with rural slightly outpacing urban. Regarding the cadence of comps, each month's increase was greater than 8.5%, with May, which had the greatest benefits of stimulus, being the strongest month. And June was slightly stronger than July. While it is still early in Q3, Family Dollar is delivering very solid same-store sales despite less government assistance being available than during the prior quarter. \n The consumables side of the business delivered another positive quarterly comp at 6.3%. While as previously mentioned, the discretionary count was a record 28.9%. We saw more than 0.25 million new sign-ups in our smart coupon program during the quarter, bringing its total enrollment to 12.8 million customers. \n Our H2 stores continue to perform very well, delivering year 1 cap lifts greater than 10% when compared to non-renovated stores. For fiscal 2020, as previously stated, we plan to renovate 750 Family Dollar stores while new stores are also being open in the H2 format. \n For the Dollar Tree segment, Dollar Tree bounced back with a 3.1% same-store sales increase for Q2 following a quarter where Easter seasonal performance was materially impacted by COVID-19. Gross margin, which was down 260 basis points year-over-year in Q1, was down 10 basis points for the second quarter. This sequential improvement was primarily due to the rebound on the discretionary side of the business following Easter. \n Geographically, comp sales were relatively balanced with increases by zone ranging from 1.2% to 4.25%. For the quarter, discretionary delivered a positive 9% comp, and consumables were down approximately 3%. The comp sales for every line of business at Dollar Tree improved from quarter 1 to quarter 2, with the exception of the food category. Factors impacting food include reduced availability of protein products from periodic plant shutdowns, slowed sales of impulse snacks as traffic has declined, and some vendors are focusing more on larger pack sizes based on demand and their production capacity. Categories performed well in the quarter include crafts, kitchenware, housework products, party celebrations, and beauty and eyewear. \n The Crafter's Square program is a tremendous hit with our customers and is driving repeat visits to our stores. Our timing with the rollout of more than 2,400 stores in Q1 could not have been better. The improved performance in the basic craft assortment is also contributing to a lift in our seasonal craft business as well. \n For the quarter, Dollar Tree's transaction count was down 15.9%, while average ticket increased 22.6% as consumers, in general, have been shopping less, but buying more. Q3 has gotten off to a good start at Dollar Tree as well. \n Regarding upcoming seasons, like back-to-school, Fall Harvest and Halloween, we are seeing more volatility than usual on the timing of back-to-school sales. But the good news is these are in line categories, and there is minimal markdown risk associated with these items. I view this as similar as the graduation category. The timing of the sales were disrupted, but, overall, the category performed very well for us. Consumers are adapting to the current environment, and are still celebrating, albeit in smaller groups or celebrating in different ways. \n In March, the merchant team took action to make adjustments in Halloween buys and derisk the category, much less focus on traditional trick or treating and large gatherings and more focus on decorations and customs. We are seeing very nice trends regarding the early sales related to Fall Harvest and Halloween. \n Now regarding Dollar Tree Plus! Our focus on selling great value merchandise at price points of $5 and below, we are continuing to analyze, learn and make adjustments to the program. Earlier this year, we transitioned from the initial consumable-dominated assortment to more of a wild-type discretionary products that Dollar Tree is known for. We recently added bins to our larger test stores to promote some hot, one-time item sales. Sales of these discretionary products remained strong with good sell-through as customers are responding favorably. We are excited about the many new, multi-price discretionary products that we already have on the store shelves for this fall selling season. We remain encouraged about the potential for Dollar Tree Plus!.\n Inventory levels in both our segments were impacted during the quarter as it relates to higher turned consumable categories. Current environment and related in-stock levels on domestic items are improving, but the continuation of high customer demand, especially on items such as paper towels and cleaning supplies, is still outpacing both vendor production, capacity and the supply. In-stock levels on certain items are constrained, but we do expect to see continued improvement as we move through the quarter. \n Throughout the quarter, we rewarded our dedicated hourly store and distribution center associates with premium pay. This was in recognition for their extraordinary efforts to protect and serve our customers effectively with enhanced cleaning protocols and other safety measures. We believe these efforts contributed to our solid top line sales performance during the quarter. The value and convenience of our stores' offer is desired in the current environment by customers who are looking to save money while shopping close to home. \n The COVID-19-related costs incurred for wage premiums for the frontline associates, our guaranteed sales bonuses for field management and the supplies needed for keeping our customers, associates and facilities safe totaled nearly $135 million for the quarter. \n Surveys indicate that customers want to shop where they feel comfortable and safe. We have invested in our associates and believe this is contributing to enhance loyalty, attendance while reducing turnover in our stores. Over time, lower turnover can lead to improved shopper experience, more efficient store operations and reduced shrink. \n During the quarter, we went to re-rank Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, first, an aggregate of strongly trusted or somewhat trusted ratings of all retailers, enforcing safety measures for shoppers. \n Additionally, as many of you have seen in the news reports, more than 100 of our stores were impacted in certain communities during the recent periods of civil unrest. Overall, we incurred nearly $17 million in costs during the quarter related to store damages, repairs and lost inventory. The majority of the impacted stores have been reopened. \n Regarding our supply chain, we continue to support planned growth and infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We recently began shipping from our newest distribution centers in Rosenberg, Texas and Ocala, Florida. These facilities will provide increased capacity and improved efficiencies to support continued profitable store growth in both Southeastern and Southwestern states. We completed more than 250 real estate projects in the quarter, including 131 new stores, 22 relocations, 76 Family Dollar H2 renovations and 26 store closings. We ended the quarter with 15,479 stores. \n I am very proud of the work our leaders throughout the organization, including our store operations and field leadership teams, our merchandising group, our DC and supply chain teams and our store support center team. \n I'll toss it over to Kevin now to provide more detail for the Q2 performance. Thanks, Kevin. \n I could not be more proud of the overall team's performance for the second quarter. As I stated earlier, it is a new day at Family Dollar. Family Dollar delivered a 13.6% comp for the first half of the year, and operating margin has improved 350 basis points from the first half a year ago. We have seen nice momentum thus far in Q3. \n Dollar Tree had a good quarter with sequential improvement in both sales and margin, following a very challenging Q1. Aside from the food category, we saw comp improvement in every line of the business in the second quarter. \n I believe we are at the right spot at the right time. We have a business teams consolidated into one store support center. Our leadership teams are aligned, focused and energized. Our support teams are receiving consistent direction and are acting with enhanced clarity, focus and speed. Our merchant teams are doing a tremendous job of adapting and reacting to evolving customer trends, and our store operators are focused on running great, clean, safe stores. \n At Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive sales, enhance gross margins and leverage our cost structure, each contributing to operating margin improvements over time. We are a growth company in the most attractive sector in retail, opening more stores, renovating stores, improving our efficiencies, generating significant free cash flow, focusing on our customers and running great businesses. I truly believe the best is still ahead of us. \n Before we go into Q&A, I would like to just share that our thoughts are with all of our families and communities and our associates that have been with and are being impacted by Hurricane Laura that is passing through the Louisiana and Texas area right now. \n Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Matt, thanks for your interest. Regarding the multi-price point at Dollar Tree, we are very interested and excited about the opportunity. We're going to -- especially as we moved into the more discretionary and wow factor that Dollar Tree is known for, we're seeing good response from our customers as we provide exciting products for them. And we're going to continue to watch it, not the key metrics that we're watching. We're going to continue to watch, are our customers responding to a favorably? Are we getting more productivity out of that 4-wall box? So we want sales per square foot to go up. And we want to enhance our margins. I mean, those are the 3 things that we'll be looking at to determine if it's successful as we continue to enhance it. \n On the Family Dollar side, we will continue. We think that, that 11.7% comp is -- just confirms that our customers are appreciating the investment we're making in our H2. They're responding favorably. And Rick and the merchant teams, too, that 18 months ago, we focused a lot on rolling out the H2. In the last 6 months, with Rick in charge, he's really working on refining that the H2 assortment. As you always have continuous improvement, we're looking at adjacencies, SKU count. How do you expand in discretionary side? So while we're rolling out that H2, the merchants are working on that continuous improvement that will get us more sales per square foot and more margin by getting our discretionary mix stronger. Matt, just to give a little color, too, on your question, getting to the 35% to 36%. We absolutely believe we can get to that range that we historically have. As Kevin said, we like the mix that can drive us there. And if you really look at our initial markdown from a product and mix perspective, we're in great shape. Our pressure is from the shrink and the DC costs. We know where it is, and we're going to get after those areas. Michael, thanks for the question. We're very proud of and like our 11.7% comp growth and especially a record 28.9% growth on the discretionary side. We're seeing that on the Family Dollar side, based on the information that we're getting from third parties and internal, that we captured 15% new customers during the quarter. Our discretionary market share gains were 3x what the market was on the discretionary side of the business. And with our 250,000 new sign-ups on our smart coupons, we are getting new customers engaged. So we like our comp sales growth. And all the things that our merchants and the Rick McNeely and the team are focused on are the right things. They're responding. And that focus to sharper price points, basic items and having what customers need when they're in our store, we think, is working. Yes. We believe we like the third quarter, and we think the third quarter is starting just like we ended the second quarter. We've got strong comp store sales. We like the mix on both sides of the business. And as Kevin said, early indicators on fall and Halloween are strong, and we think we're well positioned for that. We think, based on what we're seeing from the customer, since they're spending more time at home, they want to decorate their homes and invest in their homes more. So we're seeing those categories. So how -- we may be different, but with them spending more time at home, they're going to decorate that home since they're there. And we're seeing that in our sales. Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. And I think we're well positioned on with our -- everybody is staying at home right now. Our Crafter's Square that are -- that we rolled out the first quarter, the 2,400 stores now and more than 3,000 stores. Our customers are responding very, very well. So our merchants are continuing to rebuy that and fulfill the drive and the demand in that category. And on the consumable side, we see -- every week and each period, we see the replenishment side getting better as vendors start to drive capacity. So we're -- we like the mix of sales going forward, and I think we're going to be in a good position in the back half of the year. And going into next year, especially when the customers are going to need us most, with the unemployment, the extra benefits going away and the unemployment rate where it is, we believe we're in a great position as we were in '08, '09, '10. Yes, that's a great question. As you've seen, our DC costs are outpacing where we want them to be. So part of that is we do have a longer-term strategy to leverage our network. Currently, we are -- we have 1 co-banner DC in our St. George, Utah. But keep in mind, in the last 2, 2.5 years, every DC that we've opened or opening it with systems and the capability of co-bannering just as we have these 2. So we are starting out these 2 because that's where the growth historically has been on the Dollar Tree side, so we've been feeding that growth. But down in the Ocala business and the Texas, they are going to be capable of co-bannering. And in that long-term plan, we will be moving to that. Yes, Scot, thanks. And I would say on both sides, it's -- on the consumables side, it's really anything to do with paper and cleaning. So specifically, paper towels as people continue to enhance their protocols at home or wherever they're at with cleaning, any chemical with a kill claim, any hand sanitizer, there is still a lot of pressure on meeting the needs of the customer. But we do see the bath tissue, for instance, that is starting to improve. And actually, we can have that tissue on the shelf for more than just a couple of days. So I would say, throughout the back half of the year, we will see improvement in our in-stocks and those highly consumable items. But we are -- we have been communicated from vendors that this is a longer term -- there will be pressure on the back half of the year from our manufacturers. Yes. No, we -- not at the top of my head, we do not. Yes. Thanks for your question, Robby. So in Dollar Tree, we believe that the first half of the quarter in May, as we stated, was supported by the stimulus and the extra benefit dollars out there. But the great news is as those went away and as customers needed value and convenience and safety, they continue to shop at Dollar Tree and at Family Dollar. So we feel good about our comps towards the end of the quarter and going into the third quarter. And from the basket and transaction size, we are still seeing -- they are shopping with a purpose. When they come in, they are shopping and getting definitely driven a higher basket. So we think that will continue as we go into the fall as people continue to practice social distancing in the safety protocols as they should. Yes. We have not seen any noticeable difference. As I stated, at Family Dollar, our discretionary business, as customers came over other competitors opened up, we -- the market grew on the discretionary side but Family Dollar grew 3x back. So we're seeing that as competitors are opening up and more stores are opening, we did not see a noticeable difference in our traffic and/or basket. Yes. Thanks, Chuck. I do not have that number for the first quarter. I think we can grab that, and Randy can get back to you. Regarding what we're doing to retain them is, a, provide a great shopping experience. Now more than ever, all the surveys and what we hear from our own customers is safety, cleanliness and convenience of getting in and out is very important to them, and then provide them what our strategy is on that. \n On the consumables side, we want to have the products that are looking for on the shelf. And on the discretionary side, our teams are continuing to work on those sharper price points with great value on basic needs. And we think doing those things and providing that when they're in our store, we'll keep retaining them. And then along with -- we like the increase of 0.25 million people signing up for our smart coupons. We think that we're going to be able to enable us to speak to those customers and watch what they're buying and keep driving basket size with them. I think it's a new day at Family Dollar. And I think the direction that this team is focused on right now, under Rick McNeely and the merchants, they are bringing clarity, focus on the right things, getting the right products. And I think it's evident by retaining more customers and driving an 11.7% comp and a 28.9% comp in our discretionary business. So I think those are the right things. \n And I think structurally, in our organization, we are all in one building now under one leader. And I think we've got the right leaders in place that can drive this strategy. So it's not only what is your focus on your strategy, but having the right people in place that can drive and execute that. And I'm more confident than ever that we've got the right team on the merchandising and the operations side to execute what we need. \n And I also I think as we -- with the 2 companies coming together, the discipline that Dollar Tree has and buying that wow and driving that cost and bringing that value into products, so embedded in our culture, we've also moved some people. So as we look at our structure, we have cross-pollinated some leaders. So we've got a great leader driving our discretionary side of the business that had many, many years of experience in Dollar Tree. So it's a combination of all being in one building, having a great strategy that our customers are responding to and then getting the right people in the chairs to execute the work. Yes. Kelly, thanks. I'll throw it to Kevin for the margin. But from a perspective of accelerating, so we're trying to do as many as we can given the current environment of travel restrictions and COVID restrictions in the state. So we've -- we're going to do 750. But absolutely, as soon as the states open up in the locations, and it's safe and we can get our third parties and our teams in there to do the remodels, we will absolutely open that back up and accelerate that. Okay. From an overall standpoint, from a banner perspective, the Dollar Tree segment incurred $76.6 million in Q2 and Family Dollar incurred $57.1 million, and, again, the vast majority of that being payroll costs at the end. And between -- and mainly stores, but obviously, there's a component there of DCs, which we broke out within the detail we gave you earlier today. So you have that piece of it. As far as the $4.5 million of manager bonuses, that does not continue necessarily directly. Those were above and beyond. And as we go forward, that does -- will probably not take place. But again, it's a very fluid situation. And so it's always open for change. But at this point, we do not expect that to necessarily continue. Yes. I think that's reasonable because what you have to remember is we just -- we have an hour -- a larger hourly workforce population in the Dollar Tree banner than the Family Dollar banner. Well, I think, Karen, as you think about it. So I think within the prepared remarks, we spoke a little bit about the cadence of comps for Family Dollar and the fact that the lowest quarter -- or excuse me, the lowest month within the quarter was roughly 8.5%. And the easiest way to think about it is there's been little degradation from that trend coming out of July."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Guiler, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the first quarter of 2020.

[Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to Gary Philbin, Dollar Tree's Chief Executive Officer. \nGary Philbin: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. First, from all of us, our report today is against the backdrop of the COVID-19 impact across our country. Our hearts go on to all those affected. Today's Q1 report reflects a number of accomplishments and [ comments ] during a quarter that was impacted, unlike any other, due to the effect of COVID-19. \n First, our results around the core businesses of both business speaks to the resiliency and strength of both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree in the communities we serve. The investments we have made in our Family Dollar business in our H2 stores and assortment have been highlighted during this critical time. Second, we took quick action to protect individuals with enhanced cleaning protocols to keep the facilities clean and sanitized. We encourage social distancing guidelines as recommended by the CDC and provided PPE supplies, including masks and gloves. Additionally, we have installed more than 60,000 plexiglass shields in store checkouts. Third, our efforts to get the right products to the distribution centers and stores have been the key priority for merchants across both banners. We worked closely with vendor partners to support and streamline shipments of needed essentials. And finally, all of this could not be accomplished without the leadership of our teams across 48 states and 5 Canadian provinces. Their efforts have been remarkable, and it is humbling to see the dedication they have with their teams and for their communities. I could not be more proud of all these and the many other accomplishments against the COVID-19 crisis that's impacted our country and company. \n Family Dollar's comp of 15.5% reflected the initial impact of household stocking up on basic goods in March related to the disease. The consumable side of the business delivered a 17-plus comp, and was strong throughout the quarter. On the discretionary side, comps were positive up to Easter. And then we saw an acceleration through the end of the quarter around the home and other discretionary categories, resulting in a discretionary comp of just under 9% for Q1. Operating income for Q1 improved 230 basis points. But despite the impact of selling record volumes of lower-margin consumables and incurring the additional costs related to COVID-19, Dollar Tree's comp decreased 90 basis points, driven by the impact on Easter selling and our party business in general, from the executive orders for shelter-in-place mandates. The combined impact of the party, Candy and Easter categories negatively affected Dollar Tree's overall comp by 490 basis points. Following Easter, discretionary comps were nearly flat for the remainder of the quarter. Operating margin was 9.2%, reflecting a negative top line comp and a heavier consumable mix along with COVID costs. All COVID costs related -- all related COVID costs incurred for our wage premiums and for front-line associates, guaranteed sales bonuses for field management and supplies for keeping our facility safe totaled just over $73 million. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thank you, Gary, and good morning. Before I get into the details regarding our Q1 performance, I want to share a little bit about the associates and their remarkable work and dedication. I want to thank our teams for all they've accomplished each and every day for the last 9 weeks. Our entire leadership team is inspired and very much appreciative of their individual commitments and their collective team efforts across Dollar Tree and Family dollar. In our stores, in our DCs and in our store support center, I am very proud of the dedication of our associates. \n Regarding Dollar Tree's response to COVID-19, our company took aggressive and decisive actions early on to protect our teams and our shoppers. In early March, we activated our business response team led by risk management and human resources with representation from each functional area in the company. The group worked around the clock to assess the situation, develop policies and procedures and take action where necessary. I would like to recognize the leadership and efforts of our business response team to support our front-line workers. \n Steps we've taken to provide clean and safe environments include: our store associates are practicing social distancing as recommended by the CDC, and we continue to ask that customers also follow these guide items. We dedicated the first hour each morning to serve at-risk customers. We continue to provide store teams with hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies, for high-frequency enhanced cleaning protocols. We closed stores at 8PM to provide associates adequate time for cleaning the store and restocking shelves with essential high-demand products. We supply personal protective equipment, including nonmedical face masks and gloves for associates to wear during their shifts. We have implemented associate health screenings to ensure that we are minimizing the potential for exposure. We've installed plexiglass guards at the check lane in all stores to assist in protecting shoppers and our cashiers. \n Stores are now equipped with contactless payment through tap-to-pay with Visa, MasterCard, Apple Pay and Google Pay. We are committed to meeting or exceeding all relevant local and state requirements. By taking these steps, we have been able to keep all stores open as an essential business. \n Also in March, we announced our plans to hire 25,000 new associates, a target which we have exceeded. Our stores play a valuable role in the communities we serve, and we are dedicated to both serving customers and being an employee of choice, especially in this critical time of need. \n Now to our first quarter performance. Sales grew 8.2% to $6.2 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 7% and we delivered an EPS of $1.04. For the Dollar Tree segment, our 90 basis point decline in sales was materially impacted by weakness in party, Candy and Easter seasonal categories. We were well prepared for the Easter season with products in stores and set during February, following our strong valentine season. \n As stated in our March 31 business update, Dollar Tree had a 7.1% comp increase for the first 8 weeks of Q1, but was beginning to see a material drop off due to traffic and the initial shelter-in-place as we approached Easter. In March, seemingly overnight, there was a hyper focus on stocking up consumables at concern spread, schools, shared services, weddings and parties were canceled and widespread stay-at-home orders were mandated. We saw a material decline in demand for many of the seasonal and discretionary products related to celebrations and large gatherings. \n As Gary mentioned, the combination of party category and Easter seasonal product negatively impacted Dollar Tree's Q1 comps by approximately 490 basis points. For the quarter, the consumables delivered a positive 9% comp and the discretionary side of the business was down nearly 9%. Prior to the slowdown, our Valentine seasonal category comped over 4% with a strong sell-through. Categories that performed well, included household consumables, food, personal care and crafts. We continue to see great traction in our stores with the new Crafter Square program. We added the Crafter Square assortment to more than 2,400 Dollar Tree stores in quarter 1. Our customers are responding to the new offerings and the great values. \n For the quarter, Dollar Tree's comp transaction count was down 11.7%, while comp average ticket increased 12.2%. As consumers in general have been shopping less, but buy more, a trend that has been seen across retail. Interesting, our consumables versus the discretionary mix. Through Easter, it was 55% consumables. For the period following Easter through quarter end, there was 50-50 balance. And for the first 4 weeks of Q2, we've seen a shift to 55% discretionary. Regarding Family Dollar segment sales highlights for the first quarter include: the team delivered a 15.5% same-store sales increase on top of a 1.9% comp and Q1 a year ago. \n This was comprised of a 17.1% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 1.4% decline in transaction comp. The sales strength was broad across the geography, each zone delivering a comp increase of 13% to 19%. Regarding cadence of comps in the quarter, February was slightly positive. We had an extremely strong March with customers stocking up on consumables. As provided in our business update, the Family Dollar comp was 14.4%. Through the first 8 weeks of the quarter, the team delivered great results in April with strength in many of our discretionary categories. The consumable side of the business delivered a 17-plus-percent comp, and discretionary comp was just under 9%. \n We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our H2 stores, with comps continue to outperform the chain average by 10-plus percent. Regarding real estate for the enterprise during the quarter, we completed more than 350 projects, including 99 new stores, 21 new locations, 220 Family Dollar H2 renovations early in the quarter and then 14 store closings, primarily at the end of lease term. We ended the quarter with 15,370 stores. \n I'm very proud of our leaders throughout the organization, including our store and field leadership teams, our merchant teams, our distribution center and supply chain teams and our store support center team. \n I will now turn it to Kevin to provide more detail on our first quarter performance. \nKevin Wampler: Thank you, Mike, and good morning. Consolidated net sales for the first quarter increased 8.2% to $6.29 billion, comprised of $3.21 billion of Family Dollar and $3.08 billion of Dollar Tree. Enterprise same-store sales increased 7%, and on a segment basis, comps from Family Dollar increased 15.5% and Dollar Tree decreased 0.9%. Overall gross profit increased 3.9% to $1.79 billion, gross margin of 28.5% compared to 29.7% in Q1 2019. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased to 31.9% compared to 34.5% in the prior year's quarter. \n Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter, including merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 140 basis points. Dollar Tree saw a 4.2% shift in mix to lower margin consumables from higher-margin discretionary merchandise related to the soft Easter selling season and pandemic demand. Higher costs from the impact of an incremental $18 million of tariff costs and higher freight costs were partially offset by improved markup.\n Markdown costs increased approximately 40 basis points, resulting from increased seasonal markdowns to the lower Easter sell-through. Distribution costs increased approximately 30 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. DT payroll costs included approximately $3.5 million or 10 basis points of hourly premium pay for all hourly DT associates for hours worked since March 8 and guaranteed sales bonuses. \n Occupancy costs increased approximately 30 basis points due to loss of leverage on the comp sales decrease in the quarter and shrink increased approximately 25 basis points based on unfavorable inventory results and an increase accrual rate. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 60 basis points to 25.4% during the first quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: Occupancy costs decreased approximately 105 basis points as a result of leverage from the comp sales increase and the increased expense in the prior year related to the acceleration of amortization of right-of-use assets from store closures. And shrink decreased approximately 30 basis points resulting from an increase to the accrual rate in the prior year quarter and improved inventory results in the current year. These benefits were partially offset by merchandise costs, including freight that increased approximately 55 basis points, primarily due to a 1.6% mix shift to lower margin consumable merchandise as a result of pandemic demand and higher freight costs, partially offset then through initial markdown. And distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increased payroll costs at the DT. These costs include approximately $2.7 million or 10 basis points related to the hourly premium pay for all hourly DC associates for all always worked since March 8 and guaranteed sales bonuses. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 40 basis points to 22.7% of net sales. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales increased to 22.7% compared to 21.2% in Q1 of 2019. The increase was primarily due to approximately 145 basis points in payroll costs comprised of the following: Store hourly payroll increased approximately 120 basis points due to the store hourly premium paid to all hourly associates beginning March 8. The premium paid totaled $30 million for the quarter. Field management payroll increased approximately 15 basis points due to loss of leverage from the decrease in comparable store net sales and $800,000 of guaranteed bonuses paid. \n Store sales bonus expense increased approximately 10 basis points as a result of $2.7 million of guaranteed fund payout. Store supply costs increased approximately 10 basis points from the result of the installation of plexiglass guards and an incremental cost for PPE. Inventory service expense decreased approximately 10 basis points due to the postponement of inventories from March 15 through the end of the quarter. The SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 170 basis points to 19.9% compared to 21.6% for the first quarter of 2019. The improvement was primarily due to the leverage on stronger same-store sales. \n Payroll expenses improved 65 basis points, driven by leverage from the strong comp. Store hourly premium pay totaled $22.3 million and guaranteed bonuses totaled $1.6 million. Occupancy costs improved 55 basis points. Operating expenses decreased by approximately 40 basis points, resulting primarily from reduced advertising and travel as a percentage of sales, and depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 10 basis points. \n Additionally, corporate and support shared service expense as a percentage of sales improved 20 basis points, primarily related to leverage on stronger sales in the current year and cycling store support center consolidation costs from the prior year. Operating income was $365.9 million compared with $385 million from the same period last year, and operating income margin was 5.8% compared to 6.6% in last year's quarter. The current year's quarter included $73.2 million in COVID-19-related expenses. \n Nonoperating expenses totaled $40.7 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense and our effective tax rate was 23.9% compared to 22.1% in the prior year's first quarter. The company had net income of $247.6 million or $1.04 per diluted share, which included $73.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share of incremental operating costs for COVID-19-related expenses. This compares to net earnings of $267.9 million or $1.12 per share in the prior year quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.76 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. \n Outstanding debt as of May 2, 2020, was approximately $4.3 billion, which included $750 million drawn on our revolving line of credit. Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 4% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.2%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 3%. The team is actively managing the mix of inventory to rebuild essential goods while controlling categories such as party saw a decrease in demand in the first quarter. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end decreased 10.6% from the same period last year, while selling square foot decreased 3.9% based on store closures in the prior year. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 7%. Our Family Dollar inventory reflects higher than normal out-of-stock in certain categories. Our merchants, supply chain and vendors are working diligently to improve our positions to meet increased product demand going forward. \n Capital expenditures were $235.8 million in the first quarter versus $209.2 million in Q1 last year. For fiscal 2020, we're now planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion compared to our original guidance of $1.2 billion. Changes to our capital expenditure plan, we now expect to open 500 new stores compared to our original plan of 550. These will be comprised of 325 Dollar Tree and 175 Family Dollar, which includes a reduction of 25 planned stores for each banner. Due to the COVID-19-related suspension of our H2 renovation program, we are now planning 750 Family Dollar H2 for fiscal 2020 compared to our original plan of 1,250. Additionally, we've seen a reduction in our capital mix for supply chain based on finalization of projects for the year. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $165.5 million for Q1 compared to $151.2 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2020, we now expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $670 million to $680 million. While we are not providing sales and EPS guidance, I do want to provide a few data points for your modeling. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $39 million in Q2 and $160 million for fiscal 2020. The tax rate is expected to be 23.2% for the second quarter and 22.7% for fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted share counts are seemed to be 238 million shares for Q2 and 237.9 million shares for the full year. \n As reported in our March business update, the company withdrew our prior Q1 and fiscal year guidance. Due to the continuing uncertainties, we have limited visibility to our future business trends, which results in a wide range of potential outcomes for our 2020 financial performance. We're in a strong financial position and remain confident in our business and ability to drive long-term shareholder value. \n I will now turn the call back over to Gary. \nGary Philbin: Thank you, Kevin. The current macro environment was obviously not contemplated in painting our business for fiscal 2020. Our performance in Q1 validates that Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are important of shoppers in times of need, especially for their daily essentials. With more than 38 million Americans filing unemployment claims in just the past 9 weeks, we believe families need value and convenience more now than ever before. We have a resilient business model, a very strong balance sheet, an experienced leadership team and tremendous opportunity to continue serving customers with those values and conveniences they seek. I cannot say enough about our store and distribution center teams. They have been up to the challenge in being nimble and agile in a quick changing work environment and committed to running the business through an unprecedented time. To recognize our efforts, we have rewarded our hourly store in DC, incented with wage premiums going back to March 8. This investment in our front-line associates has totaled approximately $95 million to this point, $63 million incurred in the first quarter. \n We were also pleased to welcome more than 25,000 new associates to the organization during the quarter. Q1 is in the books. We finished the quarter strong. The momentum has carried into our second quarter. While we are still less than 4 weeks into the quarter, I am pleased to say that business is as good at this point. \n At Dollar Tree, we have seen an improvement on the discretionary side of the business. In fact, with the exception of party pay-for-all, discretionary categories are comping positive in Q2. Categories performing well include crafts, kitchenware, lawn and garden, hardware, toys. They're all performing well. We had a strong Mother's Day and school graduation sales. Crafters Square, like Mike discussed, continued to gain momentum and is now available in more than 3,000 Dollar Tree stores. In the balloon business, which was hindered in 2019 by the Helium shortage, has bounced back nicely. The comp performance at this early stage in the quarter has returned to a level we are accustomed to seeing from Dollar Tree. \n At Family Dollar, we believe the current environment with family staying close to home is provide us an opportunity to showcase improvements we have been working very hard on in recent years. Our investment in the Family Dollar store base with our H2 renovations has been a key driver since we accelerated our renovations a year ago. Now with customers and communities needing us more than ever, we are being introduced into a format that has a better shopping experience when they need it most. I'm also pleased with the work of the merchant team and the traction we are seeing on the discretionary side of the business. Our customers have moved from all things essential to more purchases to support their at-home and outdoor living. Discretionary momentum that we saw late in Q1 had certainly continued into the second quarter as well. Q2 is off to a very good start in Family Dollar. \n That said, we do expect this to continue to be an extremely volatile consumer environment. Factors impacting retail will continue to be evolution of the macroeconomic factors, including unemployment rates, variability in vendor supply chains being able to meet product demands, volatility in consumer demand related to the crisis, the value and timing of government stimulus, the duration degree and geographic breadth of bearing shelter-in-place mandates, the evolving competitive landscape across retail and restaurants and our incremental costs related to managing the business during the COVID crisis. \n We continue to focus on making meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both brands. We believe we are well positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increase value for our shareholders. The combination of more than 15,300 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers in all types of markets. \n Operator, we're now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: I wanted to ask you about the comp cadence. Could you talk a little bit more about the trends that you saw in April, both leading up in the Easter and then after Easter. And then what we have seen so far each banner? And then you provided some qualitative commentary. I'm curious if you could provide some more specific color on May and what you have seen to date from a comp perspective. \nGary Philbin: Ed, this is Gary. Let me characterize it this way. Obviously, on the Dollar Tree side, Easter was the first week of April. So we really saw the impact of shelter-in-place mandates going in, traffic dropped and Easter was not on anyone's mind going into the holiday. So the bigger seasonal impact to Dollar Tree was the Easter holiday basically evaporating. But post Easter, traffic were negative, moderated, and maybe more importantly, what we saw people buying also changed, too, from the hoarding of essentials, move to some of the other elements of what people were buying around stay at home, which meant children are were out of school, so more stationary, more back-to-school, toys for kids. \n And Family Dollar was maybe slightly a little different, not as big of a holiday effort at -- for Easter at Family Dollar and at least around pure Easter. But the things that get impacted at Family Dollar are things like people grill out, it's a family celebration, it's apparel. But I would describe it the same way. Post Easter holiday, we saw folks get back into buying more of what they needed around home living and outdoor celebration, I would call it. And with more folks at home, obviously, we're experiencing the essentials spiking of both banners. So as we go into May, while we see some traffic down, we see baskets go up and we see the breadth of what folks are buying being expanded beyond -- clearly beyond the essentials. So we like what we see going into end of April, and it's carrying on into May. \nEdward Kelly: All right. And then maybe just a follow-up from the margin perspective, particularly around the core Dollar Tree business. This has been a 35%, 36% gross margin business for a very long time. You've had some headwinds recently. A lot of it seems like it could just be transitory. Is there any reason to think you can get back to that range? And can you get back there soon, meaning Q2, Q3 at some point this year. \nGary Philbin: Well, I don't have a crystal ball that says what's going to happen exactly to the macro environment. There's no reason Dollar Tree can't get back to 35% and 36% with what we see on how we're selling our assortment. Even now, I like how the mix is occurring at Dollar Tree. The impacts that we're experiencing from COVID, everything on the supply chain. And it's everything, from how we need the DCs to run on the priorities of getting key vendors into the DCs and out to stores, we're spending extra on. When we are buying low-value essential, big Q low-value that impacts the cost of the freight coming in and out of our margin as well, and obviously, we think the current wage premiums. Long term, there's no reason. I don't know that I see it in Q2 or in the back half of the year, I dare make a guess on how the retail environment will be. But what we're buying in the value for Dollar Tree is as great as ever. Mike called out Craft. I mean here's a category that really didn't even live in Dollar Tree last year to any extent. And our customers have welcomed it wildly in the stores that we put it in, and that's the nature of Dollar Tree. We find something, we build it. You're on the new thing, and that's really the underpinning to what's going to drive margin. The thing that we've got to handle on the expense side, I've always said, given enough time, we'll scurry around the rocks, but the key to Dollar Tree's magic is keeping the magic of incredible value in front of our customer on the product we're selling. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. \nChandni Luthra: This is Chandni on behalf of Kate McShane. Could you guys talk a little bit more about stimulus in terms of sort of when did trends start to improve for you post Easter, like has that continued? Because we're only starting to hear -- we are also hearing from some customers, anecdotally that some customers are only getting payments right now. So could you talk about how you're seeing stimulus impact the business? \n And then is there a parallel to be drawn with tax refunds? We heard 1 retailer talk about it. So do you see that kind of a tailwind in terms of duration, similars versus tax refunds? \nGary Philbin: Chandni, we're getting a lot of echo on your first question. Was it around how we're seeing customers with the stimulus check? \nChandni Luthra: Yes, that is correct. So basically, my question is, is there a parallel between stimulus checks and tax refunds? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. So yes, we are seeing some impact as the stimulus gets released into the market and the tax refunds, especially on the Family Dollar side. And as Gary described, we saw some nice momentum in our discretionary side of the business with our home and drilling and coal. So we can see a correlation of the stimulus dollars being released and an increase in our basket size. \nChandni Luthra: Got it. And then if I could get a follow-up. I'm sorry, go ahead. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. We were just wondering what your follow-up -- your second question was? \nChandni Luthra: Yes. So in terms of your global supply chain, in light of the disruption this year we've seen and then with tariffs last year, are there any efforts to kind of realign sourcing globally? \nGary Philbin: Well, this ripple effect of the COVID impact, obviously, it started in Asia and then has moved into the U.S. side. And so initially, when we saw the disruption in Asia. Parallel was just the short-term effect of factories shutting down right after Chinese New Year. I would say that rebounded fairly quickly to the point that other than being measured a few weeks late on some shipments. That was something that moderated and now is not an issue for us. On the domestic side, however, the spike in demand on domestic essentials. It is something that all retailers are chasing and it varies by vendor, it varies by geography and anything that's related to cleaning, toilet paper, paper towels. While they're all getting better and we're selling record amounts, it's still something that we're probably going to be chasing, I think, into June, and I would guess maybe July with some vendors. But it's getting better week by week, and we see it in our sales. \n But it's almost shifted more to the discretionary side now. Some of the things that folks are buying are imports. We're having to go back and take a look at orders on inbound and up those. So it's been a changing shift in dynamic from when it got started, if go all the way back to the impact to China. On supply chain, U.S. domestically and now what people are buying. And so I think about it almost in those 3 stages, how we're running our business and where the priorities are. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Michael Montani of Evercore. \nMichael Montani: I just had 2 questions. The first was on the tariff front. I think initially, there was discussion of around $45 million plus of impact in the first half of this year. So I wanted to see if $20 million to $25 million is probably about right for 2Q. \n And then on the COVID expense side, you called out some of the initial labor costs to expect into 2Q. I was hoping to understand if there's additional kind of PP&E safety equipment run rate that we should be factoring in here and how normal and ongoing that would be? \nKevin Wampler: Sure. Michael, it's Kevin. As it relates to the tariffs. Again, to your point, we -- at the beginning of the year, we stated the fact that tariffs were an incremental $47 million this year, primarily on the Dollar Tree side. And again, part of it is annualization of List 3 at 25% and then obviously List 4 as well. And as we called out $25 million at that point in time at the beginning of the year, we said $25 million in Q1. It's actually annualized. It came in about $23 million, $18 million at Dollar Tree and $5 million at Family Dollar. So we look at Q2, again, we do expect roughly -- I think it's a little less than what we probably initially expected. We really expected it to be around $20 million. I think it may be closer to $15 million. Part of that is just due to some timing as we continue to work with supply chain and what comes in when. But I do believe it'll be about $15 million roughly in Q2. As it relates to COVID and the costs there, again, obviously, we did have significant cost in Q1 as we ramped up PPE supplies. Again, we also did, as Gary mentioned, 60,000 plexiglass shields in our stores, which is probably a bigger cost than the supplies, at the end of the day, to put those in place in a very rapid order. As we go forward, we are expecting, again, to incur additional supply costs as we continue to make sure that our stores have the PPE. They need masks, gloves accordingly as to keep them safe and as mandated in many areas. As well as additional cleaning supplies and sanitizers in our stores, additional cleaners to -- for the enhanced cleaning protocols we have on a daily basis in our stores. Again, it's hard to predict what it will be for Q2, but it will continue forward. And again, that's one of those unknowns and one of the reasons why we really can't give guidance going forward. \nGary Philbin: Michael, I would just add, the biggest -- lion's share of that once you get past these initial expenses is, obviously, the wage premium. Our folks are on a biweekly pay cycle in advance of each one. We give them our announcement that it's continued. Right now, we are out to mid-June with our associates on wage premium, so they can plan around that, too. So that's where we are right now. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: Good execution in a volatile and challenging marketplace. First question is on Family Dollar. Maybe just touch a bit more detail on what you're seeing there. Should we think that 2Q is more or less in line with 1Q results? \n Also, what's the feedback been from customers as they return to the format potentially, for some, for the first time in a few years and how you plan to keep those customers there? Also, just curious on any updates on the H2 front and how you feel about your inventory and overall merchandise assortment, especially on the discretionary side, which we were planning to kind of change over this year. \nGary Philbin: Well, let me start and have Mike chime in on some of the -- what we've seen on the categories. I think Family Dollar has responded maybe even better than we might have thought going into what we didn't know what was ahead of us and our customers came in and shopped the store hard because it's -- when you think about it, its convenience, its value. And with the early and quick work we did. I think we also got addressed for being a safe place to shop with all of our protocols in store, and I think we are recognized for that, with some of our internal measurements that we saw. I think we also saw more folks sign up for our Family Dollar app, which was a pretty good signal that we're gaining some new folks for the first time into the store. So I think early on, we got -- folks needed us. I think it has moved to some recognition on even some of the early work we've done on assortment in having in-stocks. \n Now I would tell you, our supply chain. We're pretty capable on supply chain around the world, but we are stressed on the domestic supply chain, like what the broader folk [ think ] are essentials. And we send the essentials to stores every week. They used to last about 2 hours. I would tell you now, it's probably lasting between 1.5 day to 4 days depending on who's getting what amounts. But as much as anything, it's done. Maybe our folks have risen to the occasion in their neighborhoods and communities. And we can -- when I just see the amount of thank yous that come into our stores, it's anecdotal, but I can only tell you folks that really count on the Family Dollar banner during this time. I think what's interesting are some of the category sells. I'll let Mike give you some color on that. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Gary described in his comments, at first, with the huge demand for those first 3 weeks, it was very weighted heavily towards the consumables side and the cleaning products and paper products. And post Easter, it shifted to at-home, our apparel business is very strong, soft home housewares, home decor, toys and hardware. And the good news is you asked about our inventory position going into the year, we were very strong in inventory position on those categories. So we are able to maintain this good in-stock position for the back half of the first quarter. And now we're -- as Gary is saying, the good news is we're replenishing those sales. \n And as you heard from me on March 4, talk about at Family Dollar, those were the categories that we're going to work really hard on to turn around our discretionary business, with basic products, with sharper price points and trying to get it into our stores in our sets and our H2 and that's what we're replenishing with now. So we sold through our inventory. What we're buying now and the changes of our replenishment. And as you heard from Gary, it is selling just as fast as we are bringing it in. So the good news is we're chasing that product and it's turning fast. And the product that we are buying now with our new disciplines is turning into customers are reacting to it. I would say one other piece of the pie that we didn't plan on, but it's starting to show up is in the closeout business. We believe there's going to be a lot of value at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree for closeouts going into the next several months. \nGary Philbin: And if I -- Paul, you asked about H2. And obviously, hard to look at March in the pandemic effect. But I would say this as we got post Easter, that H2 has continued to have a tad lift even during this time. And it's interesting that as you get into the April time frame post Easter, our rural H2, where we have most of them, outpace the urban locations. And that's not entirely surprising when you think about some of the hotspots affected the urban locations more than rural. So we're still pleased with the H2, I think, just in time. I think back to 2008, it's a different crisis, but that's about the time Dollar Tree was getting to our prototype the way we wanted it. I don't think that's dissimilar to the 1,500 H2 that we have out there that are helping us drive the business now. \nPaul Trussell: That's really helpful color. My follow-up is just to get any other comments that you can provide as it relates to guidance. I know that you're not giving anything specifically, but anything else that we should keep in mind as it relates to 2Q for the balance of the year on some of the items you've mentioned were impacted in the first quarter, things like the merchandise costs, sort of markdowns and other pressures. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. Paul, it's Kevin. I think as we think about it, we -- Gary's comments, he alluded to the fact that the Dollar Tree business mix has become, what we would call more normalized. So obviously, I do believe that as we look at Q2, that can be a positive compared to Q1. I think another item to continue to think about is as we look at diesel fuel costs. For Q1, they were down, on average, about 12% year-over-year. It started at the beginning of Q2, down 25%. Now it's a small piece of the overall freight rates. That's helpful. \n The other thing I would mention is we began the year with the expectation that we would see increases in our import freight and with our contract that begins in May. We didn't see the increase maybe that we thought we would see. So I think there's a little benefit in the back half related to that as we go forward. So a lot of moving pieces. I think distribution costs, I think if you look at that, I think there's going to continue to be pressure on our buildings that we -- where throughput is very high right now. As you can imagine, as we try to get our inventory -- our essential inventory caught up and along with the normal business. I think there could be a little pressure as we continue there. I think the company is working on a lot of things. And as always, I think we did a good job of controlling expenses in general in Q1. And I think we'll always have about a huge focus to continue to do that as we go through the year, no different than any other year and try to keep that SG&A growth at a very reasonable point. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take the next question from Peter Keith of Piper Sandler. \nPeter Keith: Gary, you'd commented that Dollar Tree is now running, I guess, in May, at a level you're accustomed to seeing. So the 2 questions on that is, would that imply kind of an up-low single-digit run rate for the quarter? And then secondly, just thinking about the exposure sort of party and celebrations, is Dollar Tree being negatively impacted at this point because there's still fewer get-togethers and potentially fewer celebrations? \nGary Philbin: Well, let me answer the second one first. Clearly, we did see the impact of shelter-in-place. Obviously, parties took the biggest hit to that, but I think the resiliency of our customer and just their creativeness that we've seen out there with the drive-through workday parties, what's been happening in graduation. We actually comped on graduation balloons last week, which I thought was just remarkable for our business. Now party is a big category for us, we split it into our celebration in paper. So the celebration is actually doing quite well right now. Party paper, as we called out before, is the piece that's lagging. \n On the other hand, Crafts, a category that we didn't talk about a year ago is now a significant category in dollars. The comp is something that customers have responded to. And I think it sort of speaks to families are trying to figure out how to entertain themselves with the magic of products that you can buy for a dollar at Dollar Tree and even at Family Dollar with toys and some of the home essentials there, too. Anything related, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, outdoor living. I mean I sort of put it into those buckets. So that's how I think about it. \n And then we're early into the quarter. I think what we want to call out on the -- what we see in Dollar Tree was it's a new normal. But it's certainly, at least in terms of the categories that we are seeing respond, feels a lot more like we're used to. We don't have any huge category or maybe celebrations, holidays until we get to the back half, really, right? We go from Memorial Day, the outdoor grilling to back-to-school, whatever that's going to trend to be in the early fall. \n After Easter, we like what we see. We're not having the same kind of impact on the seasonal side that we have all focused on 1 week in April with Easter. So I think that also lets us sort of spread our opportunity out there in the store on what we merchandise and what we put on display. And I think what we're encouraged with is the things that our customers needed, they have found in both stores and have bought at elevated levels now, really, Family Dollar, starting with the April time frame, and now it seems like Dollar Tree is getting back to its normal cadence. \nPeter Keith: Okay. I want to ask a separate question and maybe asking you and the team to put your economist hats on, which I know can be a little bit dangerous but it's on the federal unemployment benefit that's being paid out right now of $600 per week, that, at present time, is set to expire at the end of July. And obviously, no one can predict what will happen. But if that were to expire, do you view that as a notable negative to the business and maybe to the spending power of your core customer? Or conversely, does it allow you to pick up some share with your value offering? \nMichael Witynski: This is Mike. We think about it as that goes away that we will be in a great position as a value retailer when people are unemployed and they don't have that source of income. They will need value more than ever. And we should be in a great position to provide that for them. \nGary Philbin: Yes. It's not 2008 for all the obvious reasons. And it's -- what our customer has right now is money in their pocket. That's obviously a tailwind for anybody that has doors open. In 2008, folks lost jobs, too, and they needed us and they found this. And I think that's some of what we're planning for as we take a look into our crystal ball here, back half of the year into '21. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Lasser of UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Gary, what percent of Dollar Tree sales relates to gathering? Presumably party is a big piece of that, but it extends also across seasonal and discretionary as well. Would you say it's 10% of sales? 20% higher than that? \nGary Philbin: Well, that's a tough one. I mean, I would just point out sort of what we've seen is that we've seen -- if we just take a look at Easter, what was impacted was obviously the pure Easter product. Along with that, party and Candy was the 490 basis points impact for that holiday. But I think it spreads a little more out once you get past that big holiday. I think party is where we've obviously made it one of our key categories. And it's sort of bifurcated into what people can buy right now for celebration. Parties -- birthday parties are still going on. They're just happening in a different way. Graduations are still going on. They're just happening in a virtual environment. The things that get sold with that, now we're starting to see selling close to the same rates we saw before. \n The party paper is a little different. That goes to some gift-giving and some other things that I think it will catch up over time. It's just a slower burn that's kind of sad. And it's -- just take a category like stationery, it means kids are at home. There are parents trying to teach virtually or online and they needed school supplies, and so a category like that picked up. I mentioned craft. But you go down the discretionary line, people are still buying now, I think, on a normal cadence of what they have been new to on dare say, a normal shopping trip. What we're just seeing is they're coming in shopping with intent. Folks aren't coming in to buy a soft drink and in a candy bar. They're coming in because they have a need and right now, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar filled out 20', 21'. \nMichael Lasser: And my follow-up is on the Family Dollar gross margin. It is up year-over-year but against a really easy comparison, particularly on a 2-year basis. So how should we think about the trajectory of the gross margin at Family Dollar understanding that mix might have had some issues in the first quarter? But what's it going to take to be able to get this business back to a 26% to 27% gross margin? And how quickly is it -- do you expect that, that's going to happen? \nGary Philbin: Yes, Mike, I think as far as the time line, that's maybe the harder part of the equation there. I think, obviously, we're very happy with where we're headed. And obviously, the H2 renovations are a big part of that. And just the overall work that the merchant team is doing on the discretionary side of the business also plays a big role in this. And again, I think our opportunity here is to get more people in the store, show them the assortment and the reassortment and get them excited about their Family Dollar store that they shop. And I think -- so the opportunity is there. I think, again, obviously, increased volume always helps. But I think changing our trajectory of mix potentially plays a bigger role on an overall basis. We want to sell more consumables, but obviously the discretionary categories will play a bigger role. \n And then there's other things that we have to do a better job with. We've talked about shrink the last couple of years, and it's not where we wanted to be in our Family Dollar stores. And we have worked because the team is working hard, but there's more work to be done there even though we saw some improvement in Q1. I think if you look at other line items in there, obviously, markdowns have been heavy the last couple of years. I think we feel better about that as we get through this year. We talked about Q1 being more markdowns originally when we went into the plan because of the fact that we'd be working on a discretionary reassortment. But I think we've moved through that with the sales that we've seen. So I think going forward, we have this opportunity. And I think the team is working hard to make that consumer realize that it is a new assortment, a new mix and I think it'll be exciting to them. \nMichael Lasser: Can I just clarify one thing? One of your competitors reported this morning that they've seen a moderation in their cost trends in recent days. Have you seen the same thing? \nGary Philbin: I don't think that's something that we would comment on, Michael. \nOperator: Our final question will come from Paul Lejuez of Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious on the Family Dollar side, if you have any idea about the number of new customers that may have come into the network over the past several months. And then second, just to go back to the Dollar Tree gross margin. Curious, if we take mix out of the equation, if maybe you can talk about the gross margin within categories relative to themselves on a year-over-year basis, where you're seeing increases and decreases. \nGary Philbin: Well for -- clearly, as I have mentioned, I would tell you anecdotally from our folks in the field that just tell us they're seeing new customers coming in. A data point we do track is on customer feedback that we see folks who identify themselves as new customer. And then on a week-in, week-out basis, we see the number of folks that actually sign up for the first time using Family Dollar app, which we saw a spike on as people were looking for essentials. So that's our vector, has been on me -- to us that we've had an opportunity here to showcase our H2 stores, but also just improvement in our store base at Family Dollar. So that's a positive that [ might work ].\n For Dollar Tree, on the margin mix, when you think about that 490 basis point shift, I mean, I guess there's a start there. I mean that was the low point for us, losing that amount of business on a key holiday in the discretionary business. And we're getting that back to normal now. And I think if you're asking the question around if we think we'll get mix and mark-on. Well, mark-on, just fine. And when we take a look at categories like Craft now that are comping outside the norm, that's going to be a help. So as we get back to a more normal mix, the mark-on's just fine and then to Kevin's point, the thing down the line that still deserve our attention, we do have to do better on shrink. We're willing to spend more in our DCs right now to get essentials to our stores. That's probably going to be with us through at least Q2, if not past that. \n And when you're bringing in essentials, that does have an effect on the fact that you're paying basically the same freight on lower value trailers of bleach or paper towels or whatever it is compared to the normal mix. Those are sort of the near-term and short-term things that -- the way I'm thinking about it. But we're in a different place on mix right now, and we would expect Dollar Tree's gross margin to get the help from those that I called out. \nOperator: And I'd like to turn the conference back over to Randy Guiler for any additional or closing remarks. . \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Shannon. Thank you for joining us for today's call and especially for your continued interest in Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss Q2 results is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 27, 2020. \nOperator: That does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning. Consolidated net sales for the first quarter increased 8.2% to $6.29 billion, comprised of $3.21 billion of Family Dollar and $3.08 billion of Dollar Tree. Enterprise same-store sales increased 7%, and on a segment basis, comps from Family Dollar increased 15.5% and Dollar Tree decreased 0.9%. Overall gross profit increased 3.9% to $1.79 billion, gross margin of 28.5% compared to 29.7% in Q1 2019. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased to 31.9% compared to 34.5% in the prior year's quarter. \n Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance for the quarter, including merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 140 basis points. Dollar Tree saw a 4.2% shift in mix to lower margin consumables from higher-margin discretionary merchandise related to the soft Easter selling season and pandemic demand. Higher costs from the impact of an incremental $18 million of tariff costs and higher freight costs were partially offset by improved markup.\n Markdown costs increased approximately 40 basis points, resulting from increased seasonal markdowns to the lower Easter sell-through. Distribution costs increased approximately 30 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. DT payroll costs included approximately $3.5 million or 10 basis points of hourly premium pay for all hourly DT associates for hours worked since March 8 and guaranteed sales bonuses. \n Occupancy costs increased approximately 30 basis points due to loss of leverage on the comp sales decrease in the quarter and shrink increased approximately 25 basis points based on unfavorable inventory results and an increase accrual rate. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 60 basis points to 25.4% during the first quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: Occupancy costs decreased approximately 105 basis points as a result of leverage from the comp sales increase and the increased expense in the prior year related to the acceleration of amortization of right-of-use assets from store closures. And shrink decreased approximately 30 basis points resulting from an increase to the accrual rate in the prior year quarter and improved inventory results in the current year. These benefits were partially offset by merchandise costs, including freight that increased approximately 55 basis points, primarily due to a 1.6% mix shift to lower margin consumable merchandise as a result of pandemic demand and higher freight costs, partially offset then through initial markdown. And distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increased payroll costs at the DT. These costs include approximately $2.7 million or 10 basis points related to the hourly premium pay for all hourly DC associates for all always worked since March 8 and guaranteed sales bonuses. \n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 40 basis points to 22.7% of net sales. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales increased to 22.7% compared to 21.2% in Q1 of 2019. The increase was primarily due to approximately 145 basis points in payroll costs comprised of the following: Store hourly payroll increased approximately 120 basis points due to the store hourly premium paid to all hourly associates beginning March 8. The premium paid totaled $30 million for the quarter. Field management payroll increased approximately 15 basis points due to loss of leverage from the decrease in comparable store net sales and $800,000 of guaranteed bonuses paid. \n Store sales bonus expense increased approximately 10 basis points as a result of $2.7 million of guaranteed fund payout. Store supply costs increased approximately 10 basis points from the result of the installation of plexiglass guards and an incremental cost for PPE. Inventory service expense decreased approximately 10 basis points due to the postponement of inventories from March 15 through the end of the quarter. The SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 170 basis points to 19.9% compared to 21.6% for the first quarter of 2019. The improvement was primarily due to the leverage on stronger same-store sales. \n Payroll expenses improved 65 basis points, driven by leverage from the strong comp. Store hourly premium pay totaled $22.3 million and guaranteed bonuses totaled $1.6 million. Occupancy costs improved 55 basis points. Operating expenses decreased by approximately 40 basis points, resulting primarily from reduced advertising and travel as a percentage of sales, and depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 10 basis points. \n Additionally, corporate and support shared service expense as a percentage of sales improved 20 basis points, primarily related to leverage on stronger sales in the current year and cycling store support center consolidation costs from the prior year. Operating income was $365.9 million compared with $385 million from the same period last year, and operating income margin was 5.8% compared to 6.6% in last year's quarter. The current year's quarter included $73.2 million in COVID-19-related expenses. \n Nonoperating expenses totaled $40.7 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense and our effective tax rate was 23.9% compared to 22.1% in the prior year's first quarter. The company had net income of $247.6 million or $1.04 per diluted share, which included $73.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share of incremental operating costs for COVID-19-related expenses. This compares to net earnings of $267.9 million or $1.12 per share in the prior year quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.76 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. \n Outstanding debt as of May 2, 2020, was approximately $4.3 billion, which included $750 million drawn on our revolving line of credit. Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 4% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.2%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 3%. The team is actively managing the mix of inventory to rebuild essential goods while controlling categories such as party saw a decrease in demand in the first quarter. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end decreased 10.6% from the same period last year, while selling square foot decreased 3.9% based on store closures in the prior year. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 7%. Our Family Dollar inventory reflects higher than normal out-of-stock in certain categories. Our merchants, supply chain and vendors are working diligently to improve our positions to meet increased product demand going forward. \n Capital expenditures were $235.8 million in the first quarter versus $209.2 million in Q1 last year. For fiscal 2020, we're now planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion compared to our original guidance of $1.2 billion. Changes to our capital expenditure plan, we now expect to open 500 new stores compared to our original plan of 550. These will be comprised of 325 Dollar Tree and 175 Family Dollar, which includes a reduction of 25 planned stores for each banner. Due to the COVID-19-related suspension of our H2 renovation program, we are now planning 750 Family Dollar H2 for fiscal 2020 compared to our original plan of 1,250. Additionally, we've seen a reduction in our capital mix for supply chain based on finalization of projects for the year. \n Depreciation and amortization totaled $165.5 million for Q1 compared to $151.2 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2020, we now expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $670 million to $680 million. While we are not providing sales and EPS guidance, I do want to provide a few data points for your modeling. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $39 million in Q2 and $160 million for fiscal 2020. The tax rate is expected to be 23.2% for the second quarter and 22.7% for fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted share counts are seemed to be 238 million shares for Q2 and 237.9 million shares for the full year. \n As reported in our March business update, the company withdrew our prior Q1 and fiscal year guidance. Due to the continuing uncertainties, we have limited visibility to our future business trends, which results in a wide range of potential outcomes for our 2020 financial performance. We're in a strong financial position and remain confident in our business and ability to drive long-term shareholder value. \n I will now turn the call back over to Gary. Yes. We were just wondering what your follow-up -- your second question was? Sure. Michael, it's Kevin. As it relates to the tariffs. Again, to your point, we -- at the beginning of the year, we stated the fact that tariffs were an incremental $47 million this year, primarily on the Dollar Tree side. And again, part of it is annualization of List 3 at 25% and then obviously List 4 as well. And as we called out $25 million at that point in time at the beginning of the year, we said $25 million in Q1. It's actually annualized. It came in about $23 million, $18 million at Dollar Tree and $5 million at Family Dollar. So we look at Q2, again, we do expect roughly -- I think it's a little less than what we probably initially expected. We really expected it to be around $20 million. I think it may be closer to $15 million. Part of that is just due to some timing as we continue to work with supply chain and what comes in when. But I do believe it'll be about $15 million roughly in Q2. As it relates to COVID and the costs there, again, obviously, we did have significant cost in Q1 as we ramped up PPE supplies. Again, we also did, as Gary mentioned, 60,000 plexiglass shields in our stores, which is probably a bigger cost than the supplies, at the end of the day, to put those in place in a very rapid order. As we go forward, we are expecting, again, to incur additional supply costs as we continue to make sure that our stores have the PPE. They need masks, gloves accordingly as to keep them safe and as mandated in many areas. As well as additional cleaning supplies and sanitizers in our stores, additional cleaners to -- for the enhanced cleaning protocols we have on a daily basis in our stores. Again, it's hard to predict what it will be for Q2, but it will continue forward. And again, that's one of those unknowns and one of the reasons why we really can't give guidance going forward. Yes. Paul, it's Kevin. I think as we think about it, we -- Gary's comments, he alluded to the fact that the Dollar Tree business mix has become, what we would call more normalized. So obviously, I do believe that as we look at Q2, that can be a positive compared to Q1. I think another item to continue to think about is as we look at diesel fuel costs. For Q1, they were down, on average, about 12% year-over-year. It started at the beginning of Q2, down 25%. Now it's a small piece of the overall freight rates. That's helpful. \n The other thing I would mention is we began the year with the expectation that we would see increases in our import freight and with our contract that begins in May. We didn't see the increase maybe that we thought we would see. So I think there's a little benefit in the back half related to that as we go forward. So a lot of moving pieces. I think distribution costs, I think if you look at that, I think there's going to continue to be pressure on our buildings that we -- where throughput is very high right now. As you can imagine, as we try to get our inventory -- our essential inventory caught up and along with the normal business. I think there could be a little pressure as we continue there. I think the company is working on a lot of things. And as always, I think we did a good job of controlling expenses in general in Q1. And I think we'll always have about a huge focus to continue to do that as we go through the year, no different than any other year and try to keep that SG&A growth at a very reasonable point."

            "name": "Gary Philbin",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. First, from all of us, our report today is against the backdrop of the COVID-19 impact across our country. Our hearts go on to all those affected. Today's Q1 report reflects a number of accomplishments and [ comments ] during a quarter that was impacted, unlike any other, due to the effect of COVID-19. \n First, our results around the core businesses of both business speaks to the resiliency and strength of both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree in the communities we serve. The investments we have made in our Family Dollar business in our H2 stores and assortment have been highlighted during this critical time. Second, we took quick action to protect individuals with enhanced cleaning protocols to keep the facilities clean and sanitized. We encourage social distancing guidelines as recommended by the CDC and provided PPE supplies, including masks and gloves. Additionally, we have installed more than 60,000 plexiglass shields in store checkouts. Third, our efforts to get the right products to the distribution centers and stores have been the key priority for merchants across both banners. We worked closely with vendor partners to support and streamline shipments of needed essentials. And finally, all of this could not be accomplished without the leadership of our teams across 48 states and 5 Canadian provinces. Their efforts have been remarkable, and it is humbling to see the dedication they have with their teams and for their communities. I could not be more proud of all these and the many other accomplishments against the COVID-19 crisis that's impacted our country and company. \n Family Dollar's comp of 15.5% reflected the initial impact of household stocking up on basic goods in March related to the disease. The consumable side of the business delivered a 17-plus comp, and was strong throughout the quarter. On the discretionary side, comps were positive up to Easter. And then we saw an acceleration through the end of the quarter around the home and other discretionary categories, resulting in a discretionary comp of just under 9% for Q1. Operating income for Q1 improved 230 basis points. But despite the impact of selling record volumes of lower-margin consumables and incurring the additional costs related to COVID-19, Dollar Tree's comp decreased 90 basis points, driven by the impact on Easter selling and our party business in general, from the executive orders for shelter-in-place mandates. The combined impact of the party, Candy and Easter categories negatively affected Dollar Tree's overall comp by 490 basis points. Following Easter, discretionary comps were nearly flat for the remainder of the quarter. Operating margin was 9.2%, reflecting a negative top line comp and a heavier consumable mix along with COVID costs. All COVID costs related -- all related COVID costs incurred for our wage premiums and for front-line associates, guaranteed sales bonuses for field management and supplies for keeping our facility safe totaled just over $73 million. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Mike. Thank you, Kevin. The current macro environment was obviously not contemplated in painting our business for fiscal 2020. Our performance in Q1 validates that Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are important of shoppers in times of need, especially for their daily essentials. With more than 38 million Americans filing unemployment claims in just the past 9 weeks, we believe families need value and convenience more now than ever before. We have a resilient business model, a very strong balance sheet, an experienced leadership team and tremendous opportunity to continue serving customers with those values and conveniences they seek. I cannot say enough about our store and distribution center teams. They have been up to the challenge in being nimble and agile in a quick changing work environment and committed to running the business through an unprecedented time. To recognize our efforts, we have rewarded our hourly store in DC, incented with wage premiums going back to March 8. This investment in our front-line associates has totaled approximately $95 million to this point, $63 million incurred in the first quarter. \n We were also pleased to welcome more than 25,000 new associates to the organization during the quarter. Q1 is in the books. We finished the quarter strong. The momentum has carried into our second quarter. While we are still less than 4 weeks into the quarter, I am pleased to say that business is as good at this point. \n At Dollar Tree, we have seen an improvement on the discretionary side of the business. In fact, with the exception of party pay-for-all, discretionary categories are comping positive in Q2. Categories performing well include crafts, kitchenware, lawn and garden, hardware, toys. They're all performing well. We had a strong Mother's Day and school graduation sales. Crafters Square, like Mike discussed, continued to gain momentum and is now available in more than 3,000 Dollar Tree stores. In the balloon business, which was hindered in 2019 by the Helium shortage, has bounced back nicely. The comp performance at this early stage in the quarter has returned to a level we are accustomed to seeing from Dollar Tree. \n At Family Dollar, we believe the current environment with family staying close to home is provide us an opportunity to showcase improvements we have been working very hard on in recent years. Our investment in the Family Dollar store base with our H2 renovations has been a key driver since we accelerated our renovations a year ago. Now with customers and communities needing us more than ever, we are being introduced into a format that has a better shopping experience when they need it most. I'm also pleased with the work of the merchant team and the traction we are seeing on the discretionary side of the business. Our customers have moved from all things essential to more purchases to support their at-home and outdoor living. Discretionary momentum that we saw late in Q1 had certainly continued into the second quarter as well. Q2 is off to a very good start in Family Dollar. \n That said, we do expect this to continue to be an extremely volatile consumer environment. Factors impacting retail will continue to be evolution of the macroeconomic factors, including unemployment rates, variability in vendor supply chains being able to meet product demands, volatility in consumer demand related to the crisis, the value and timing of government stimulus, the duration degree and geographic breadth of bearing shelter-in-place mandates, the evolving competitive landscape across retail and restaurants and our incremental costs related to managing the business during the COVID crisis. \n We continue to focus on making meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both brands. We believe we are well positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increase value for our shareholders. The combination of more than 15,300 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers in all types of markets. \n Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Ed, this is Gary. Let me characterize it this way. Obviously, on the Dollar Tree side, Easter was the first week of April. So we really saw the impact of shelter-in-place mandates going in, traffic dropped and Easter was not on anyone's mind going into the holiday. So the bigger seasonal impact to Dollar Tree was the Easter holiday basically evaporating. But post Easter, traffic were negative, moderated, and maybe more importantly, what we saw people buying also changed, too, from the hoarding of essentials, move to some of the other elements of what people were buying around stay at home, which meant children are were out of school, so more stationary, more back-to-school, toys for kids. \n And Family Dollar was maybe slightly a little different, not as big of a holiday effort at -- for Easter at Family Dollar and at least around pure Easter. But the things that get impacted at Family Dollar are things like people grill out, it's a family celebration, it's apparel. But I would describe it the same way. Post Easter holiday, we saw folks get back into buying more of what they needed around home living and outdoor celebration, I would call it. And with more folks at home, obviously, we're experiencing the essentials spiking of both banners. So as we go into May, while we see some traffic down, we see baskets go up and we see the breadth of what folks are buying being expanded beyond -- clearly beyond the essentials. So we like what we see going into end of April, and it's carrying on into May. Well, I don't have a crystal ball that says what's going to happen exactly to the macro environment. There's no reason Dollar Tree can't get back to 35% and 36% with what we see on how we're selling our assortment. Even now, I like how the mix is occurring at Dollar Tree. The impacts that we're experiencing from COVID, everything on the supply chain. And it's everything, from how we need the DCs to run on the priorities of getting key vendors into the DCs and out to stores, we're spending extra on. When we are buying low-value essential, big Q low-value that impacts the cost of the freight coming in and out of our margin as well, and obviously, we think the current wage premiums. Long term, there's no reason. I don't know that I see it in Q2 or in the back half of the year, I dare make a guess on how the retail environment will be. But what we're buying in the value for Dollar Tree is as great as ever. Mike called out Craft. I mean here's a category that really didn't even live in Dollar Tree last year to any extent. And our customers have welcomed it wildly in the stores that we put it in, and that's the nature of Dollar Tree. We find something, we build it. You're on the new thing, and that's really the underpinning to what's going to drive margin. The thing that we've got to handle on the expense side, I've always said, given enough time, we'll scurry around the rocks, but the key to Dollar Tree's magic is keeping the magic of incredible value in front of our customer on the product we're selling. Chandni, we're getting a lot of echo on your first question. Was it around how we're seeing customers with the stimulus check? Well, this ripple effect of the COVID impact, obviously, it started in Asia and then has moved into the U.S. side. And so initially, when we saw the disruption in Asia. Parallel was just the short-term effect of factories shutting down right after Chinese New Year. I would say that rebounded fairly quickly to the point that other than being measured a few weeks late on some shipments. That was something that moderated and now is not an issue for us. On the domestic side, however, the spike in demand on domestic essentials. It is something that all retailers are chasing and it varies by vendor, it varies by geography and anything that's related to cleaning, toilet paper, paper towels. While they're all getting better and we're selling record amounts, it's still something that we're probably going to be chasing, I think, into June, and I would guess maybe July with some vendors. But it's getting better week by week, and we see it in our sales. \n But it's almost shifted more to the discretionary side now. Some of the things that folks are buying are imports. We're having to go back and take a look at orders on inbound and up those. So it's been a changing shift in dynamic from when it got started, if go all the way back to the impact to China. On supply chain, U.S. domestically and now what people are buying. And so I think about it almost in those 3 stages, how we're running our business and where the priorities are. Michael, I would just add, the biggest -- lion's share of that once you get past these initial expenses is, obviously, the wage premium. Our folks are on a biweekly pay cycle in advance of each one. We give them our announcement that it's continued. Right now, we are out to mid-June with our associates on wage premium, so they can plan around that, too. So that's where we are right now. Well, let me start and have Mike chime in on some of the -- what we've seen on the categories. I think Family Dollar has responded maybe even better than we might have thought going into what we didn't know what was ahead of us and our customers came in and shopped the store hard because it's -- when you think about it, its convenience, its value. And with the early and quick work we did. I think we also got addressed for being a safe place to shop with all of our protocols in store, and I think we are recognized for that, with some of our internal measurements that we saw. I think we also saw more folks sign up for our Family Dollar app, which was a pretty good signal that we're gaining some new folks for the first time into the store. So I think early on, we got -- folks needed us. I think it has moved to some recognition on even some of the early work we've done on assortment in having in-stocks. \n Now I would tell you, our supply chain. We're pretty capable on supply chain around the world, but we are stressed on the domestic supply chain, like what the broader folk [ think ] are essentials. And we send the essentials to stores every week. They used to last about 2 hours. I would tell you now, it's probably lasting between 1.5 day to 4 days depending on who's getting what amounts. But as much as anything, it's done. Maybe our folks have risen to the occasion in their neighborhoods and communities. And we can -- when I just see the amount of thank yous that come into our stores, it's anecdotal, but I can only tell you folks that really count on the Family Dollar banner during this time. I think what's interesting are some of the category sells. I'll let Mike give you some color on that. And if I -- Paul, you asked about H2. And obviously, hard to look at March in the pandemic effect. But I would say this as we got post Easter, that H2 has continued to have a tad lift even during this time. And it's interesting that as you get into the April time frame post Easter, our rural H2, where we have most of them, outpace the urban locations. And that's not entirely surprising when you think about some of the hotspots affected the urban locations more than rural. So we're still pleased with the H2, I think, just in time. I think back to 2008, it's a different crisis, but that's about the time Dollar Tree was getting to our prototype the way we wanted it. I don't think that's dissimilar to the 1,500 H2 that we have out there that are helping us drive the business now. Well, let me answer the second one first. Clearly, we did see the impact of shelter-in-place. Obviously, parties took the biggest hit to that, but I think the resiliency of our customer and just their creativeness that we've seen out there with the drive-through workday parties, what's been happening in graduation. We actually comped on graduation balloons last week, which I thought was just remarkable for our business. Now party is a big category for us, we split it into our celebration in paper. So the celebration is actually doing quite well right now. Party paper, as we called out before, is the piece that's lagging. \n On the other hand, Crafts, a category that we didn't talk about a year ago is now a significant category in dollars. The comp is something that customers have responded to. And I think it sort of speaks to families are trying to figure out how to entertain themselves with the magic of products that you can buy for a dollar at Dollar Tree and even at Family Dollar with toys and some of the home essentials there, too. Anything related, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, outdoor living. I mean I sort of put it into those buckets. So that's how I think about it. \n And then we're early into the quarter. I think what we want to call out on the -- what we see in Dollar Tree was it's a new normal. But it's certainly, at least in terms of the categories that we are seeing respond, feels a lot more like we're used to. We don't have any huge category or maybe celebrations, holidays until we get to the back half, really, right? We go from Memorial Day, the outdoor grilling to back-to-school, whatever that's going to trend to be in the early fall. \n After Easter, we like what we see. We're not having the same kind of impact on the seasonal side that we have all focused on 1 week in April with Easter. So I think that also lets us sort of spread our opportunity out there in the store on what we merchandise and what we put on display. And I think what we're encouraged with is the things that our customers needed, they have found in both stores and have bought at elevated levels now, really, Family Dollar, starting with the April time frame, and now it seems like Dollar Tree is getting back to its normal cadence. Yes. It's not 2008 for all the obvious reasons. And it's -- what our customer has right now is money in their pocket. That's obviously a tailwind for anybody that has doors open. In 2008, folks lost jobs, too, and they needed us and they found this. And I think that's some of what we're planning for as we take a look into our crystal ball here, back half of the year into '21. Well, that's a tough one. I mean, I would just point out sort of what we've seen is that we've seen -- if we just take a look at Easter, what was impacted was obviously the pure Easter product. Along with that, party and Candy was the 490 basis points impact for that holiday. But I think it spreads a little more out once you get past that big holiday. I think party is where we've obviously made it one of our key categories. And it's sort of bifurcated into what people can buy right now for celebration. Parties -- birthday parties are still going on. They're just happening in a different way. Graduations are still going on. They're just happening in a virtual environment. The things that get sold with that, now we're starting to see selling close to the same rates we saw before. \n The party paper is a little different. That goes to some gift-giving and some other things that I think it will catch up over time. It's just a slower burn that's kind of sad. And it's -- just take a category like stationery, it means kids are at home. There are parents trying to teach virtually or online and they needed school supplies, and so a category like that picked up. I mentioned craft. But you go down the discretionary line, people are still buying now, I think, on a normal cadence of what they have been new to on dare say, a normal shopping trip. What we're just seeing is they're coming in shopping with intent. Folks aren't coming in to buy a soft drink and in a candy bar. They're coming in because they have a need and right now, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar filled out 20', 21'. Yes, Mike, I think as far as the time line, that's maybe the harder part of the equation there. I think, obviously, we're very happy with where we're headed. And obviously, the H2 renovations are a big part of that. And just the overall work that the merchant team is doing on the discretionary side of the business also plays a big role in this. And again, I think our opportunity here is to get more people in the store, show them the assortment and the reassortment and get them excited about their Family Dollar store that they shop. And I think -- so the opportunity is there. I think, again, obviously, increased volume always helps. But I think changing our trajectory of mix potentially plays a bigger role on an overall basis. We want to sell more consumables, but obviously the discretionary categories will play a bigger role. \n And then there's other things that we have to do a better job with. We've talked about shrink the last couple of years, and it's not where we wanted to be in our Family Dollar stores. And we have worked because the team is working hard, but there's more work to be done there even though we saw some improvement in Q1. I think if you look at other line items in there, obviously, markdowns have been heavy the last couple of years. I think we feel better about that as we get through this year. We talked about Q1 being more markdowns originally when we went into the plan because of the fact that we'd be working on a discretionary reassortment. But I think we've moved through that with the sales that we've seen. So I think going forward, we have this opportunity. And I think the team is working hard to make that consumer realize that it is a new assortment, a new mix and I think it'll be exciting to them. I don't think that's something that we would comment on, Michael. Well for -- clearly, as I have mentioned, I would tell you anecdotally from our folks in the field that just tell us they're seeing new customers coming in. A data point we do track is on customer feedback that we see folks who identify themselves as new customer. And then on a week-in, week-out basis, we see the number of folks that actually sign up for the first time using Family Dollar app, which we saw a spike on as people were looking for essentials. So that's our vector, has been on me -- to us that we've had an opportunity here to showcase our H2 stores, but also just improvement in our store base at Family Dollar. So that's a positive that [ might work ].\n For Dollar Tree, on the margin mix, when you think about that 490 basis point shift, I mean, I guess there's a start there. I mean that was the low point for us, losing that amount of business on a key holiday in the discretionary business. And we're getting that back to normal now. And I think if you're asking the question around if we think we'll get mix and mark-on. Well, mark-on, just fine. And when we take a look at categories like Craft now that are comping outside the norm, that's going to be a help. So as we get back to a more normal mix, the mark-on's just fine and then to Kevin's point, the thing down the line that still deserve our attention, we do have to do better on shrink. We're willing to spend more in our DCs right now to get essentials to our stores. That's probably going to be with us through at least Q2, if not past that. \n And when you're bringing in essentials, that does have an effect on the fact that you're paying basically the same freight on lower value trailers of bleach or paper towels or whatever it is compared to the normal mix. Those are sort of the near-term and short-term things that -- the way I'm thinking about it. But we're in a different place on mix right now, and we would expect Dollar Tree's gross margin to get the help from those that I called out."

            "name": "Michael Witynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary, and good morning. Before I get into the details regarding our Q1 performance, I want to share a little bit about the associates and their remarkable work and dedication. I want to thank our teams for all they've accomplished each and every day for the last 9 weeks. Our entire leadership team is inspired and very much appreciative of their individual commitments and their collective team efforts across Dollar Tree and Family dollar. In our stores, in our DCs and in our store support center, I am very proud of the dedication of our associates. \n Regarding Dollar Tree's response to COVID-19, our company took aggressive and decisive actions early on to protect our teams and our shoppers. In early March, we activated our business response team led by risk management and human resources with representation from each functional area in the company. The group worked around the clock to assess the situation, develop policies and procedures and take action where necessary. I would like to recognize the leadership and efforts of our business response team to support our front-line workers. \n Steps we've taken to provide clean and safe environments include: our store associates are practicing social distancing as recommended by the CDC, and we continue to ask that customers also follow these guide items. We dedicated the first hour each morning to serve at-risk customers. We continue to provide store teams with hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies, for high-frequency enhanced cleaning protocols. We closed stores at 8PM to provide associates adequate time for cleaning the store and restocking shelves with essential high-demand products. We supply personal protective equipment, including nonmedical face masks and gloves for associates to wear during their shifts. We have implemented associate health screenings to ensure that we are minimizing the potential for exposure. We've installed plexiglass guards at the check lane in all stores to assist in protecting shoppers and our cashiers. \n Stores are now equipped with contactless payment through tap-to-pay with Visa, MasterCard, Apple Pay and Google Pay. We are committed to meeting or exceeding all relevant local and state requirements. By taking these steps, we have been able to keep all stores open as an essential business. \n Also in March, we announced our plans to hire 25,000 new associates, a target which we have exceeded. Our stores play a valuable role in the communities we serve, and we are dedicated to both serving customers and being an employee of choice, especially in this critical time of need. \n Now to our first quarter performance. Sales grew 8.2% to $6.2 billion. Consolidated same-store sales increased 7% and we delivered an EPS of $1.04. For the Dollar Tree segment, our 90 basis point decline in sales was materially impacted by weakness in party, Candy and Easter seasonal categories. We were well prepared for the Easter season with products in stores and set during February, following our strong valentine season. \n As stated in our March 31 business update, Dollar Tree had a 7.1% comp increase for the first 8 weeks of Q1, but was beginning to see a material drop off due to traffic and the initial shelter-in-place as we approached Easter. In March, seemingly overnight, there was a hyper focus on stocking up consumables at concern spread, schools, shared services, weddings and parties were canceled and widespread stay-at-home orders were mandated. We saw a material decline in demand for many of the seasonal and discretionary products related to celebrations and large gatherings. \n As Gary mentioned, the combination of party category and Easter seasonal product negatively impacted Dollar Tree's Q1 comps by approximately 490 basis points. For the quarter, the consumables delivered a positive 9% comp and the discretionary side of the business was down nearly 9%. Prior to the slowdown, our Valentine seasonal category comped over 4% with a strong sell-through. Categories that performed well, included household consumables, food, personal care and crafts. We continue to see great traction in our stores with the new Crafter Square program. We added the Crafter Square assortment to more than 2,400 Dollar Tree stores in quarter 1. Our customers are responding to the new offerings and the great values. \n For the quarter, Dollar Tree's comp transaction count was down 11.7%, while comp average ticket increased 12.2%. As consumers in general have been shopping less, but buy more, a trend that has been seen across retail. Interesting, our consumables versus the discretionary mix. Through Easter, it was 55% consumables. For the period following Easter through quarter end, there was 50-50 balance. And for the first 4 weeks of Q2, we've seen a shift to 55% discretionary. Regarding Family Dollar segment sales highlights for the first quarter include: the team delivered a 15.5% same-store sales increase on top of a 1.9% comp and Q1 a year ago. \n This was comprised of a 17.1% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 1.4% decline in transaction comp. The sales strength was broad across the geography, each zone delivering a comp increase of 13% to 19%. Regarding cadence of comps in the quarter, February was slightly positive. We had an extremely strong March with customers stocking up on consumables. As provided in our business update, the Family Dollar comp was 14.4%. Through the first 8 weeks of the quarter, the team delivered great results in April with strength in many of our discretionary categories. The consumable side of the business delivered a 17-plus-percent comp, and discretionary comp was just under 9%. \n We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our H2 stores, with comps continue to outperform the chain average by 10-plus percent. Regarding real estate for the enterprise during the quarter, we completed more than 350 projects, including 99 new stores, 21 new locations, 220 Family Dollar H2 renovations early in the quarter and then 14 store closings, primarily at the end of lease term. We ended the quarter with 15,370 stores. \n I'm very proud of our leaders throughout the organization, including our store and field leadership teams, our merchant teams, our distribution center and supply chain teams and our store support center team. \n I will now turn it to Kevin to provide more detail on our first quarter performance. Yes. So yes, we are seeing some impact as the stimulus gets released into the market and the tax refunds, especially on the Family Dollar side. And as Gary described, we saw some nice momentum in our discretionary side of the business with our home and drilling and coal. So we can see a correlation of the stimulus dollars being released and an increase in our basket size. Yes. Gary described in his comments, at first, with the huge demand for those first 3 weeks, it was very weighted heavily towards the consumables side and the cleaning products and paper products. And post Easter, it shifted to at-home, our apparel business is very strong, soft home housewares, home decor, toys and hardware. And the good news is you asked about our inventory position going into the year, we were very strong in inventory position on those categories. So we are able to maintain this good in-stock position for the back half of the first quarter. And now we're -- as Gary is saying, the good news is we're replenishing those sales. \n And as you heard from me on March 4, talk about at Family Dollar, those were the categories that we're going to work really hard on to turn around our discretionary business, with basic products, with sharper price points and trying to get it into our stores in our sets and our H2 and that's what we're replenishing with now. So we sold through our inventory. What we're buying now and the changes of our replenishment. And as you heard from Gary, it is selling just as fast as we are bringing it in. So the good news is we're chasing that product and it's turning fast. And the product that we are buying now with our new disciplines is turning into customers are reacting to it. I would say one other piece of the pie that we didn't plan on, but it's starting to show up is in the closeout business. We believe there's going to be a lot of value at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree for closeouts going into the next several months. This is Mike. We think about it as that goes away that we will be in a great position as a value retailer when people are unemployed and they don't have that source of income. They will need value more than ever. And we should be in a great position to provide that for them."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Dollar Tree Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. This meeting is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Randy Guiler. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Dollar Tree's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2022 results. With me on today's call are Chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling; and CFO, Jeff Davis. \n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about our expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements.

Today's press release and 8-K and other filings we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n We caution against reliance on these forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements, except as may be required by law. Following our prepared remarks, Rick and Jeff will take your questions. Given the large number of those that would like to participate, I ask that you limit your questions to one. I will now turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. I apologize that I'm a little horse. I'm coming off of COVID and the good news is I'm fine. I will review the highlights for quarter 4 fiscal 2022 and will provide an update on current priorities. Then Jeff will detail our financial performance and expectations for 2023. \n For the quarter, we delivered $7.72 billion in sales, an increase of 9%, with enterprise comp growth of 7.4%, operating income of $618.1 million, leading to a quarter 4 EPS of $2.04. Our sales performance for the fourth quarter was a continuation of momentum from quarter 3. Same-store sales growth of 8.7% at Dollar Tree and 5.8% at Family Dollar represented comp accelerations on a 1-, 2- and 3-year stack basis. This improved performance and market share gain is not simply happening by itself. It's the result of lots of hard work and good work by our store and merchant teams as well as the early fruits of our price, labor and store investments. And I truly believe we are just getting started. \n I have been in retailing for half a century. And I've been fortunate to play a leadership role in multiple transformations. I am incredibly excited by and energized to be part of the path ahead for Dollar Tree. We have an exceptional team assembled, and I cannot overstate the amount of positive transformational change occurring in this business. We are committed to enhancing store productivity as we focus on developing our people, tools and technology to fuel accelerated growth. And that we do this while simplifying operations, improving the supply chain and innovating our merchandising strategies to better support our associates and to better serve our shoppers. \n Given the team's relevant prior experiences, we know exactly what to do to drive improved productivity and profitability. We are moving as quickly as possible to capture the full potential of this business, and I am confident we will succeed. We have tremendous opportunity to improve the Dollar Tree banner. At Family Dollar, it's clear that we are at least a decade behind, and this is reflected in our prior performance levels and financial results. As we narrow the gap operationally, it will be realized in material improvements to our financial performance. As we get settled in, we are finding more and more opportunities to meaningfully improve both banners. \n Compared to just a few short months ago, the list of improvement opportunities has grown. Our guiding objective is to maximize returns to our shareholders. Doing so calls for implementing these initiatives with responsible urgency. There is no point in dialing. It has, over the months, become increasingly clear that our team's great experience gives us the opportunity to complete in just 3 to 5 years, most of what has taken far longer in other situations. \n Our merchants, stores and other teams are driving lots of initiatives, many of them with minimal investment. I will highlight some of these later. While these are already gaining traction, they will have the greatest impact, if supported by additional complementary investments. The stronger our associate team, the better the store conditions the more competitive our pricing, the more we will get out of them. There is a synergy across these initiatives and the complementary investments we are making with each enhancing the others. For this reason, we are accelerating and pulling forward our schedule of major high-returning investments. The cost of these investments is reflected in our 2023 outlook, as an incremental $430 million increase in SG&A, and the outlook assumes only a minimal return from these investments. The company is confident that these investments once implemented, will yield attractive returns in 2024 and beyond. \n While we are confident these operating expense investments will yield strong returns, we are also aware of the dynamic nature of the earliest stages of a turnaround. The many simultaneous moving pieces, the interdependence of many of these pieces and in current unusual dynamics in the economy. These considerations make forecasting the quarterly cadence of the benefits from these investments, particularly challenging. For this reason, for this first year of our transformation, we will consider these benefits only as they, in fact, materialize. \n This year's investments, which include the full year impact of investments made during fiscal 2022 are in several key areas in the following order of magnitude, labor and wages, including hourly wage rates and investments in field personnel, stores, through repairs and maintenance and improving store conditions, corporate, including technology and other initiatives. Under this new leadership team, we are increasing average hourly wages and estimated $2 for the 2-year period of 2022 and 2023. We feel that looking on a market-by-market basis and benchmarking to comparable retail wages, this investment will put us in a more competitive position. We also made additional investments in store hours and coverage, investments in our field labor and managers and other areas to help us execute much better. We expect these labor and wage investments will drive improved execution in our stores, higher sales, lower turnover, attraction of and retention of talent, reduce shrink and greater productivity and efficiency. \n Our associates and field personnel are critical to our transformation journey and we are excited about the investments in our talent. We are looking to invigorate the culture of this business, give our local operators and associates, the tools they need to execute and importantly provide them the opportunities they deserve to grow within our company. \n On store standards, we call last quarter, I spoke about an intense focus on store standards, our commitments to clean them up, straighten them up and fill them up. When we do this, our shoppers respond with a bigger basket and more importantly, with repeat visits. Our new COO, Mike Creedon, joined the team in October. Mike possesses a relentless focus on the 3 pillars of successful store operations, the work, the worker and the workplace. The work we must run efficient and productive stores. As a high transaction volume business, it's critical we have processes in place to get product onto our shelves quickly. I'm certain that we can't sell a product if it's in the back room. Approving efficiencies and workflows positively impacts our associate experience. \n The worker, as an organization must be a cornerstone that we support and enable our associates to be successful. This commitment will enhance our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain associates and contribute to their retail career development. We believe this focus, combined with our wage investments are contributing to the reduction in turnover that we are starting to see. The workplace and as we have indicated in the past, we must improve our store and DC conditions, and we are in the process of doing so. Frankly, stores and DCs were not being maintained up to our new leadership standards. We are actively transitioning from what we consider to be reactive to proactive maintenance approach. \n In addition to the work, the worker and the workplace, Mike's team are in the process of identifying certified GOLD stores for each region. GOLD stands for a Grand Opening Look Daily. These stores will serve as a clear, concise example for our district and store leadership teams across all regions so they have a distinct vision and understanding of what our most successful and well-run stores look like. \n On the question of our corporate investments, I will address these later in the call. Our merchandising teams led by Rick McNeely and [ Lara Gada ] are working hard. The Dollar Tree merchant team successfully managed through the transition to the $1.25 primary price point. As we cycle the majority of these stores throughout the fourth quarter, we saw a 410 basis point sequential improvement in traffic compared to quarter 3. \n Now that we have anniversaried the remainder of our stores in February, traffic is positive, and we are confident it will be a contributor to positive comps at Dollar Tree throughout the year. In 2022, we added $3 and $5 plus merchandise into more than 1,800 Dollar Tree stores. We plan to add this multiple price point product in another 1,800 or more stores in 2023. And when we begin flowing this multiple price product through 3 additional distribution centers, bringing our total to 7. \n Separately, we have been aggressively expanding our $3, $4, $5 frozen and refrigerated product across the Dollar Tree store base going from 0 to 3,500 stores in 2022. \n This consists of 3 cooler doors, 1 at each price point with an attractive selection of proteins, pizza, ice cream and more, which the customers are responding positively to. What we are seeing with Dollar Tree plus and multiple price frozen is that when the customer purchased at least one of these items, the basket size is more than double the basket with no multi-priced items. We are experiencing a more consistent and predictable slide chain. Stores were set well in advance for Valentine's Day, and we had terrific sell-through. The stores are now well prepared for the Easter season. And with $1.25 transition now behind us, we believe it's time for Dollar Tree merchants to get more creative than ever before. They have [ carved launch] to raise the bar on delighting customers and driving sales and all options are up for discussion. We believe doing what is easy has no reward. \n In addition to the opportunities at the Dollar Tree banner, we have a tremendous long-term opportunity to improve the operating performance at Family Dollar. We have a number of sales and margin-driving initiatives that are already underway, albeit in the early stages. But as you have seen, these have contributed to the 4.1% comp in quarter 3, followed by a 5.8% in quarter 4. Among our actions are the following: we have begun raising the shelf height to a 70-inch profile throughout the stores to enable us to broaden the product offering for our shoppers. This profit-enhancing initiative allows us to grow our SKU base by 1,000 items, including OTC and [HBA], without increasing our store-related costs. \n We are continuing to expand the number of cooler doors with plans to add 16,000 doors in 2023 to accommodate more frozen and refrigerated items. Our goal is to have 30 doors per store. Our shoppers rely on Family Dollar in their communities to provide these consumable base products to feed their families. We are replacing our control brands with private brands, and we will be introducing hundreds of national brand equivalent products in the back half of this year. These will include new labels and redefined labels, many of which are being developed in our new test kitchen here in Chesapeake, Virginia. \n To better meet both store and shopper needs, we are improving our ability to ship in [ ECS ], which improves inventory flow and profitability on slower moving, higher-margin items including the over-the-counter and health and beauty products. This enables us to be more nimble and provides greater flexibility. Additionally, we are working on improving Family Dollar productivity by enhancing end-cap displays, eliminating flex space and refining store adjacencies to better optimize the box. These are just a few examples that Larry's teams are focused on that we believe will contribute to Family Dollars improved sales trajectory in the sales ahead. \n We continue to be pleased with our positioning from a price perspective. We are at parity with key competitors and have widened the gap to grocery and drug. Shoppers have responded to the sharp pricing actions we took in late quarter 2 and third-party data suggest that Family Dollar is seeing an increasing amount of new customers in our stores. \n I will now turn the mic over to Jeff Davis, while Jeff has just been in his CFO seat at Dollar Tree since October, he is peddling fast and making great progress in a number of key strategic initiatives including leading the development of our long-term financial plan. Jeff will now provide more color on quarter 4 and what's ahead of us. \nJeffrey Davis: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Unless otherwise stated, all fourth quarter comparisons are against the same period a year ago. In addition to my comments today, a supplemental slide deck that outlines several of our key operating metrics is available on our Investor Relations website. \n Operating income increased 6.8% to $618.1 million or 8% of total revenue a 20 basis point decline in operating margin. This was compared to a 70 basis point improvement in gross profit margin, which was more than offset by SG&A. Gross profit increased 11.6% to $2.39 billion. The Dollar Tree segment gross margin improved 110 basis points, primarily from higher initial mark-on, lower freight cost and sales leverage, partially offset by product mix, product cost inflation and higher costs for markdowns, shrink and distribution. \n Family Dollar's gross margin increased 20 basis points. This quarter represented Family Dollar's first improvement in gross margin in the last 7 quarters. The improvement was driven by higher initial mark-on, lower freight cost and leverage on occupancy, partially offset by mix, markdowns, shrink and higher distribution costs. \n SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased 80 basis points to 22.9%. The increase is due to a $23.9 million noncash store impairment charge along with elevated repairs and maintenance as part of our commitment to improve store and DC standards. Investments in store and distribution center hourly wages, and inflationary costs across several expense categories. Corporate support and other expenses were consistent at 1.4% of revenue. Net income was $452.2 million, and EPS was $2.04 in comparison to $2.01 a year ago. \n Moving to the balance sheet. My comments will reflect balanced comparisons at the end of Q4 2022 versus Q4 2021. Combined cash and cash equivalents totaled $643 million compared to $985 million. Inventory increased 24.8%, primarily from unit growth associated with early receipts of spring 2023 merchandise, Family Dollar combo expansion and new store unit growth and cost growth from product inflation, including freight, the expansion of the $1.25 and multi-price plus inventory. Units per store are at a similar level to pre-pandemic period. Our inventory is fresh, and we have limited dated inventory well within manageable levels. \n Capital expenditures were $328 million, in the fourth quarter versus $271.6 million. For fiscal 2023, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $2 billion. Of this $2 billion, we would characterize 39% is dedicated to business continuity with the remaining 61% for what we consider to be growth optimization and productivity improvement. The business continuity includes projects to run and operate our stores and DCs as well as enhanced safety and compliance programs. More specifically, this would include freezers and coolers, HVAC replacements and facility improvements for stores. DC conveyor projects and building improvements for our distribution facilities, enhance permanent cooling for our DCs and store safety and asset protection related projects. \n Our growth optimization and productivity improvement projects will include approximately 650 new stores, an estimated 1,000 store renovations, numerous distribution center projects and technology projects to enhance our efficiencies and support our growth. \n Our 2023 sales and EPS expectations incorporate a number of factors. First, this is a 53-week year. We expect this will benefit the fourth quarter by approximately $500 million in sales and $0.29 in diluted EPS. Second, we are cycling the outsized margin benefit for Dollar Tree's initial transition to the $1.25 price point where last year, it produced a 39% margin rate in the first half of 2022 as we evolved our assortments to the new price point. Also for both segments, we expect to see continued cost pressure from inflation and margin pressure from merchandise mix as consumables are expected to outpace discretionary sales. Third, our outlook includes a benefit of approximately $1 per share from reduced freight expenses with nearly all of that benefit realized in the second half. Approximately half of our fiscal 2023 import container volume will remain at existing long-term contracts or charters at elevated rates. \n We anticipate meaningfully lower rates for renegotiated contracts and spot volumes, which we expect to impact the remaining half of our container volume for the year. These factors limit the impact of lower freight rates on operating profits within the year. The Dollar Tree segment will realize approximately 80% of these freight savings, which will support a gross margin rate in the range of 36% to 37% in fiscal 2023. If current market conditions persist, we expect an additional freight cost relief of approximately $1 in fiscal 2024 and 2025 with the majority realized in fiscal 2024. \n Four, our outlook includes approximately $430 million or $1.45 per share in operating expenses across labor and wages, store repairs and maintenance and corporate as we accelerate our investments to transform this company. These investments are roughly split evenly between the 2 banners and include investments in corporate. Given the amount of transformational activity, initiative interdependencies and the volatility of economic environment, it is difficult to precisely estimate the timing and related magnitude of investment returns. \n Our 2023 outlook assumes only a minimal benefit from these investments. Company is confident that these investments, once implemented, will yield attractive returns in 2024 and beyond. There is strong evidence in the back half of 2022 that management's actions and investments are already yielding results at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree as evidenced by our recent trends. While our outlook assumes minimal profit contribution from Family Dollar this year, we believe there is tremendous opportunity to improve Family Dollar sales productivity and margins and we are confident this opportunity will realize and produce meaningful profits in the years ahead. \n Finally, we will continue to focus on people, store conditions, tools and technology to drive growth and long-term operating performance improvements. We expect SG&A expense dollars, which includes general inflation, new store expenses and accelerated investments as well as the 53rd week to grow in the low teens. Based on the confluence of these factors, we anticipate year-over-year gross and operating margins will decline in the first half of 2023, followed by growth in the second half. We estimate 2023 EPS will be comprised of approximately 40% in the first half and approximately 60% in the second half which includes 1 extra week in Q4. \n Consolidated net sales for the full year fiscal 2023 are expected to range from $29.9 billion to $30.5 billion. We expect a low to mid-single-digit comp store sales increase for the year, comprised of a low single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a mid-single-digit increase in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow from 3% to 3.5%. \n Our new store openings this year will be more back end weighted compared to 2022. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $6.30 and $6.80. For Q1, we forecast consolidated net sales will range from $2.7 billion (sic) [ $7.2 billion ] to $7.4 billion based on a mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for Q1 are estimated to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.56. While share repurchases are not included in the outlook, we had $1.85 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of January 28. \n Other modeling considerations for the 2023 outlook include the following: we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $845 million to $850 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million in Q1 and $97 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.25% to 24.5% for the first quarter and for the fiscal 2023 period. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 222.4 million shares for Q1 and 222.6 million shares for the full year. \n I'll now turn the call back to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Jeff. As an organization, we are moving fast. Our operating initiatives are in flight and are gaining steam and the current economic climate is driving more higher income consumers into value retail. We believe we are in the right spot to deliver quality, value and convenience that shoppers need today. The momentum is continuing as both segments are off to a nice start early in quarter 1. \n Before we move to Q&A, I want to briefly discuss 2 additional contributors to our future success. Information technology and supply chain. In order to unlock the value creation opportunity ahead of us, we must have the right tools and technology in place to support our accelerated growth. [ Bobby Aflatooni's ] Technology Group has a clear vision and they are prioritizing projects that will have the greatest impact on our enhanced performance. Some of the increased speed fueling these projects, our capital expenditures and some are operating expenses. All of the projected spend for this year is captured and included in our outlook. \n And John Flanagan's supply chain team is doing a great deal of work to enhance efficiency and ensure the stores have the merchandise they need and can upstock it easily. We have identified an approach for eliminating the inefficiency of our current manual case-by-case handling process. This should enable us to more efficiently and reliably get products from our DCs onto our trucks and then into our stores. John has committed to having at least 1 DC up and running on the new process by the end of the year, which much more to come in 2024 and beyond. This will be a big step forward for our organization and especially for our store associates. \n Also, I would like to pat our DC teams on the back. In the past year, all 25 of our DCs have been good distribution practices certified by an independent third-party auditor, and we are already in the process to begin recertifying for 2023. The company is very proud of this achievement and believe it demonstrates our company's commitment to our associates to run good clean buildings. 2022 represented a year of substantial change for the Dollar Tree organization. Of the 16 officers listed on Dollar Tree's website, only 2 were with our company 15 months ago. That is clearly a great deal of change in a very short period of time. \n I would like to share my sincere gratitude to our 207,000 associates that have not only embraced change but have welcomed our new leaders and me to the organization. One day, we will be able to reflect on 2022 as the inflection point that got our company back on track. To capture the remarkable long-term value creation journey ahead of us. The team knows that I'm all in, in my commitment to support our store and field associates as they develop and grow in their retail careers by running full, clean and friendly stores to serve our shoppers each and every day. The long-term opportunity ahead of us is bigger than I imagined before I joined the Dollar Tree team. \n I want to be very clear. This transformation is not about saving dollars to deliver success. It's about spending dollars in the right places to unlock the future value of the business. This transformation is a process, which includes stabilizing the organization as we run and operate our business and make investments to modernize and transform the company to create long-term value for our stakeholders. \n As Jeff outlined, we pulled forward into 2023, certain investments that could otherwise have been extended for several years. And consequently, we expect fiscal 2023 to be a step back in earnings from the prior year. We're excited about this acceleration of initiatives and investments as it means higher and earlier returns in the years ahead. This is an important year to put us on a path for an acceleration in growth and earnings as we move forward. \n We believe that this approach will maximize returns for our shareholders. Our leaders are eager to share more details on our vision and the path to get there, and we will do so in a more structured format in our Investor Day here in Southeast Virginia, currently being planned for June. We intend for this to be the first of several events over the years ahead as we outline our transformation and its progress along the way. \n Before I turn it over to questions, I would like to take a moment on behalf of the employees, Board, shareholders to extend our thanks to Mike Witynski for his years of service and contributions. Mike, we're all grateful to you and wish you the best. Operator, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. Appreciate all the color, and I hope you're feeling better, Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Matt. \nMatthew Boss: So maybe to kick off at Dollar Tree, can you elaborate on the sequential improvement in comps that you're seeing in stores that have now lapped the break the dollar, maybe larger picture, how best to think about opportunities for that concept going forward. Relative to before the decision to break the buck? And then just separately, can you touch on success of the $3 and $5 item introduction? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. The answer, Matt, is let's do the last 1 first, the $3 to $5. We're very pleased. And the key takeaway on that is not only selling the product but the store's ability to manage it the multiple price points and not create confusion for the customer, which is why we've taken the approach that everything is now on the table. So very pleased with that. \n The improvement, as I look at the improvement, it's not only the sales, but more importantly, the transaction count and what's going on in the basket. And we know that the basket is substantially larger when we get the multiple price points in it. So very -- we're pleased. We're excited. And now that we've cycled it, we're getting a true measure on what's going on. \nMatthew Boss: Yes. No, no, no, absolutely. And then maybe just to switch gears over to Family Dollar. So with mid-single-digit comps now for the second straight quarter, could you just elaborate on the market share gains that you're seeing with the acceleration of the investments. I guess what I'm trying to get to is, is there any visibility that you can share for multiyear return? And any change in the high single-digit long-term operating margin opportunity at Family Dollar? \nRichard Dreiling: We'll spend a lot more time talking about that sort of thing at the Investor Day. And while I do not want to be specific, Family Dollar is starting to gain share. And it's also gaining a larger share of the wallet. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from Trust Securities. \nScot Ciccarelli: Good to hear you. I guess a little bit of a follow-up on that second question, which is, I think we all kind of understand the need to accelerate investment in the business. But Rick, you made a comment earlier in your remarks about you plan to achieve in 3 to 5 years, what usually takes a lot longer. So I guess the question is, should we view kind of '23 as a reset or starting point for growth in '24 and beyond? Or just given that list of growing projects you mentioned, could we see investment spending continue to pressure earnings growth in '24 and '25? \nRichard Dreiling: Excellent question. I would look at '23 as kind of getting us level set -- and I think the investments we will utilize in '24 and '25 will be more basic. You're always investing in the business, but it won't be anything of the magnitude that we're tackling now. \nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And then the second question is just in a lot of retail turnarounds in the past, there's a natural limit to how much change a new management team can induce in a short period of time. Do you think that could be a challenge as you've kind of settled in at the Dollar Tree, Family Dollar operation at this point, Rick? \nRichard Dreiling: Another great question. The more time I spend here, I'll make a couple of observations for you, Scot. It's becoming really clear to me the composition of the new team married with the older team, there's a tremendous amount of experience here. And we believe that experience is going to help us drive -- to drive to get things done faster. Then you couple that with an organization the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree organization. I have never seen the willingness to accept change like I'm seeing here. \n The 207,000 people in this company are dying to be high performers, and they believe in what we're doing. And they're seeing -- are the investments we've made so far in price and wage, store investments we've made in terms of the quality of the facilities, the employees are seeing that they're seeing those changes. They're seeing them in sales and their viewing it as all positive. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll now move to the next question from Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: I wanted to just follow up on the market share Family Dollar. I mean, certainly, it has been challenged over the years, but it does seem that with price and store investments that is actually starting to change. So a question on traffic, which remained negative on a year-over-year basis but also multiyear. So how important is it to inflect positive for the model to work here? And how do you envision arriving there? Like what are the most critical components of the strategy to actually unlock that? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. I mean I think as I reflect on what you're asking here, the most important thing we can do is maintain consistent store standards and execute against our operating model. We have -- we know what to do and I think if you look what's taking place, the consumer is responding to it and they're responding to it in terms of a bigger share of their wallet, they're responding in terms of market share. And all of the initiatives that we are putting in place, Krisztina, are all designed for that store experience. Even if you look at what we're doing with labor, we're not trying to take labor out of the store. We're trying to eliminate work so we could spend that on more customer-facing activities. \nKrisztina Katai: That's great. And just a quick follow-up. Again, regarding Family Dollar, but can you just touch on in-stock levels? How is that improving since the new team has been in place? And how far are we from optimal levels of in-stocks? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. I would say one of the key initiatives in this building is the in-stock level at Family Dollar. Several things are happening. A lot of the manufacturers have retailers on allocation. So if you order 100 cases, you might get 65. And that is affecting everybody right now. \n The other issue we are -- we have discovered, we've had for a long period of time is we use a perpetual inventory system and if that system is not right, if it's not showing the on-hand quantities properly, the system will order product. So we're going through a process now of truing that up but I will reiterate one of the -- and people are tired of me talking about it around here, in-stock is one of our key initiatives. \nKrisztina Katai: Right. Thank you so much. Best of luck. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Good to hear you're recovering from the COVID. So I just wanted to clarify, you talked about those wage investments. Can you just walk through that again? Because I wasn't quite sure, I think you said $2 an hour, but I wasn't sure on the sequencing of that. So I just wanted to better understand that. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, sir. We're doing that market by market. And what we're looking at is not only the hourly wages, which is where the bulk of the investment is. We're also looking at coverage to ensure we have the proper amount of coverage and then we're also looking at what I would call the field team, the store manager and the district manager. We do know, and it's proven that when we have the right wage structure, we increased our retention and our turnover has been pretty astronomical and we're seeing that slow down. We know we get better shrink, we know we get better store standards and we get better morale. And that all leads to better execution, which the customer sees on the shelf when they're in the store. So it's a broad-based approach. \nAnthony Chukumba: Got it. Look forward to seeing you in June. \nOperator: We'll now move to our next question from Michael Lasser from UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So Rick, the message today and what it's been for the last few quarters is, look, we're going to burden the cost structure with a lot of investments to get this business to where it needs to be, and we're going to frame and quantify what the return on these investments is going to be at some later date. So could you give at least a framework on what you expect the return on these investments to how you expect them to flow in terms of timing and the nature of how the return on investment is going to look, if it's just sales leverage on fixed cost, it may take quite a bit of time for the enterprise to get back to the operating margin level that it achieved historically. \n And as part of that, for the $400 million that you're investing this year, how does that break down between those wage investments that are more structural in nature and the maintenance and repairs that are perceived to be more onetime in nature? \nJeffrey Davis: Thank you, Michael. This is Jeff. As we think about the returns, and Rick had indicated earlier, there are a number of interdependencies that are related to these investments. So as you can imagine, we are a lot of these investments are complementary to what we're doing with our merchandising and our other store initiatives. Those interdependencies are dependent upon us being able to execute against this against all 16,000 stores, and it will take time through the course of 2023 to accomplish that. We have seen early on at the back half of 2022, some early returns and some tests that we've done. So we're confident that we will have an improvement in returns in future years. \n But between the interdependency as well as, quite honestly, trying to execute this and what we are all seeing as a somewhat uncertain macroeconomic environment. The combination of these 2 things, we believe that the impacts of this year will be minimal. We're saying it is minimal because it is not any relevant level for us to actually speak any specifics to it at this point in time. \nOperator: We will now move to our next question from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: How are you? \nJeffrey Davis: Good, sir. \nJohn Heinbockel: Excellent. Looking forward to seeing you again. Can you touch on, right, the consumable opportunity at Dollar Tree right? I know historically, it's not been a huge consumable business because of the price point limitations. How do you think about that opportunity, right, in terms of getting MPP rolled out coolers everywhere expanding that beyond right, the 3 coolers. And then when you think about guarding against going too far, right, in terms of either mix or cannibalizing FDO if that's an issue? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, great question. I think as I reflect on the consumables, the $3, $4 and $5 frozen food is a perfect example of there is a -- there's an appetite for it in the stores. I do think it's a balance, but I will say this, consumables drive transactions. And what we have to figure out is how to get a consumable item and a nonconsumable item in the basket together and grow the basket. And that's the challenge right now. So as we look at consumables, John, it's going to be a very selective approach. Hey, this sounds silly, but we introduced Bread into Dollar Tree over the last quarter. We put Ice in Dollar Tree over the last quarter, and they're doing very, very well. And we've done it without offsetting the mix in the store. So it's a methodical process. But I think what's important here is that it's nothing but opportunity if we can manage our way through it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi. \nBrandon Cheatham: Hi everyone, this is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I want to dig in on the freight cost. Just curious if you can expand on why wouldn't that be a benefit in real time spot rates are below where you contracted. I just want to imagine you'd be able to go back to your business partners and negotiate something that looks a little bit more like the freight costs that are being experienced on the spot market. So just curious if you can expand on some of the dynamics there and the timing of that benefit this year and next year? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. So there's a couple of pieces to this. First off, our teams are always going back to our supplier partners and looking for ways to reduce our costs where that is available. And to the extent that later they are and given our volumes and sort of our scale to the extent that we can do so, we'll take advantage of that. But part of the challenge also for us is that a large portion of our contracts, about 60% of all the contracted business that we have for any particular year right now. About 60% of that is long-term charter or contracted rates. And that's the reason why those contracts and charters do not roll off until starting late 2024 or 2025. \n The other element of this is that we capitalize our freight into our inventory cost. So in any one particular year, to the extent that our inventory is turning, let's say, 4x, you've got that portion that is going to roll over to the next year as part of your capitalized cost. So the combination of those things, so it's going to be the timing of contract expiration and renegotiation. It's going to be the carryover from 1 year to the next are the 2 reasons why for us, we have more of a back-ended loaded benefit of freight in 2023 that we'll be carrying over into 2024. But then also, you have a further continuation of freight cost reductions as those other contracts roll off. \nBrandon Cheatham: That's very helpful. Best of luck. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: Wondering if we can just talk a little bit more about the operating expense investment in particular, the wages. How much of the $430 million is wages and you called out the $2 increase in your labor rates. Just curious if you can help us understand where this brings your average, your starting wage how would that compare to peers once this is implemented? And does this bring you in line with peers or get ahead of the rest of the industry? \nJeffrey Davis: I appreciate your question because I realized I didn't answer the $430 question earlier, so I apologize. Of the $430 million, about 2/3 of that is related to wage and wage-related items. The delta, if you will, is around setting the store standards, what we're doing in sort of standards that we're doing IT, what we're doing in our supply chain. As it relates to our wage rates of $2, it definitely brings us more competitive in the marketplace as it closes the gap. We believe that, once again, it's not only closing the gap on hourly wages, but then it's also for us collectively bringing us more competitive as it relates to the field leadership teams. We haven't provided any sort of average hourly rate, but it is about a 20% increase over the course of the 2 years that $2 would represent. \nKelly Bania: Okay. That's very helpful. And just another one on freight. The comments you provided are very helpful, but you've outlined sort of $2 in freight really over the next couple of years. I guess the question is, would that be a -- would that reflect a full recovery of the significant increase in freight costs that you've had over the last few years? Or is that assuming only a partial recovery. \nRichard Dreiling: It would only be a partial recovery. There's a number of factors to this. One, freight rates have not gone back to 2019 levels in its entirety. Also, as you think about freight, there are really 3 components of freight and everyone seems to want to focus only on the transatlantic portion. But there's import and -- I'm sorry, inbound and outbound freight also, which is ultimately included in all of this. And those particular rates you have not seen a significant reduction or return back to 2019 as driver costs, chassis costs, fuel, all those components continue to be at more elevated rates versus 2019. So as we look at these freight cost reductions in its entirety, we do not -- we're not forecasting this is going to recover that which we would have seen in comparison to 2019. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll now move to -- apologize please go ahead. We will now move to our next to Joe Feldman, Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I had a question about the investments that you guys are making, you've outlined both the Dollar Tree side, the Family Dollar side. As you think of store improvement, presumably, it's more on the Family Dollar side, but I'm just curious how you balance the investments between the 2 and how you decide where to allocate to each brand and where you feel there's more need for store improvement. Is it -- because it sounded like Dollar Tree actually could use some store improvement, too, which I think I was a little surprised by, but maybe you could address that issue? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, I'll take that, Jeff, and then you can jump in. The first thing I want to say is we believe in the long-term earnings power of both banners and we think there's potential there, and I look forward to sharing that with everybody on the Analyst Day. I think if we are honest with ourselves, which we are, the facilities in both banners need work in terms of the quality of the gondolas, floor care, ceiling care, lights, I can go down the list that applies to both banners. \n I think when you look at the difference between the 2 banners and what shows up in one versus the other, in terms of store standards is Dollar Tree has no planograms in it. So it's incredibly easy just to put stuff on the shelf. And a lot of sins get covered up when you do that. Family dollar, every square inch of that thing when we get done by the middle of the year, we'll be playing to grant. And out of stocks, rusty shelves and more problems show up when you have a planogram based merchandising strategy. So I would look at you and say, both stores have a tremendous amount of opportunity. Both banners have a lot of long-term earnings power. So it's really not a balance. It's more about getting it done in both. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And Rick, you had mentioned earlier that you're seeing that trade down or trade in from higher income consumers, which I know we've all heard about and are seeing it as well. But how does the health of the consumer factor into your forecast this year? And how you see the consumer health playing out? That would be great. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. I mean what we're seeing is the consumer making $80,000 a year is trading down. And that's -- timing is everything. We're doing better on so many fronts with a long way to go. They're having an experience they can relate to. But as far as planning for that in our outlook, no, we don't do that. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Okay. Good luck this quarter. \nOperator: We will now take our next question from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Two-parter on Family Dollar. First, on the comp, we would have expected it to be more traffic than ticket given some of the price investments. It's the opposite. So maybe related to that last question to diagnose how the customer is spending and maybe give us a peak on the basket composition? And then second, it's a little bit of a twist on what was asked before. There is a step change that should happen in Family Dollar with EBIT and margin. Your comps are inflecting. Obviously, the business isn't really generating a lot of profit. I know there's a lot of assumption in that, but curious what's the assumption that needs to happen for the profit that you have to keep comping at this rate? Or there is some profit or is there some profit unlock? \nRichard Dreiling: So in terms of the composition of the basket, like every other consumable retailer, we're seeing the shift toward more consumables. I do think that -- So the basket is increasing. \nJeffrey Davis: So there's 2 things, if I could maybe add to that. One, as it relates to the -- one, quality of merchandising, the opportunities we're presenting. But also from a pricing perspective, the work that we've done, there's been a multipoint reduction against the market, if you will, in our pricing to gain parity as Mike -- excuse me, as Rick has said, with respect to our competitive sets as well as widening the gap of grocery and convenience. So the combination of those 2 things is very encouraging for us as it relates to improved traffic as well as being able to drive still ticket at those lower prices on a year-over-year basis. And then as it relates to Family Dollar and its ability to generate greater levels of profitability, there is somewhat of a step function that's going on right now with these accelerated investments. And it's more exacerbated against Family Dollar P&L because of its overall unit economics versus that of Dollar Tree, as you well recognized. \n We believe that as we continue to drive greater productivity from a top line perspective, improve -- simplify our stores and its operating procedures such that we can further leverage off of the existing base that we're building up. We believe that we will be able to drive higher levels of profitability. The last piece is from a margin perspective, gross margin perspective, the things that Larry is doing, we're talking about from a private label additions that, that will also help us from a gross margin. So top line sales, gross margin improvement and then leverage against some of these expenses that we are now incurring over the longer period of time. \nRichard Dreiling: If I could add one thing. I think the key takeaway on what has been said is there is no structural problems with either [ Van ]. It's all fixable, and we know how to fix it. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We have reached our allotment time. I will turn it over to Randy Guiler for final comments. \nRandy Guiler: Sure, Dave, thank you very much. Thank you for joining us on today's call, and have a good day. Take care. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Dreiling",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. I apologize that I'm a little horse. I'm coming off of COVID and the good news is I'm fine. I will review the highlights for quarter 4 fiscal 2022 and will provide an update on current priorities. Then Jeff will detail our financial performance and expectations for 2023. \n For the quarter, we delivered $7.72 billion in sales, an increase of 9%, with enterprise comp growth of 7.4%, operating income of $618.1 million, leading to a quarter 4 EPS of $2.04. Our sales performance for the fourth quarter was a continuation of momentum from quarter 3. Same-store sales growth of 8.7% at Dollar Tree and 5.8% at Family Dollar represented comp accelerations on a 1-, 2- and 3-year stack basis. This improved performance and market share gain is not simply happening by itself. It's the result of lots of hard work and good work by our store and merchant teams as well as the early fruits of our price, labor and store investments. And I truly believe we are just getting started. \n I have been in retailing for half a century. And I've been fortunate to play a leadership role in multiple transformations. I am incredibly excited by and energized to be part of the path ahead for Dollar Tree. We have an exceptional team assembled, and I cannot overstate the amount of positive transformational change occurring in this business. We are committed to enhancing store productivity as we focus on developing our people, tools and technology to fuel accelerated growth. And that we do this while simplifying operations, improving the supply chain and innovating our merchandising strategies to better support our associates and to better serve our shoppers. \n Given the team's relevant prior experiences, we know exactly what to do to drive improved productivity and profitability. We are moving as quickly as possible to capture the full potential of this business, and I am confident we will succeed. We have tremendous opportunity to improve the Dollar Tree banner. At Family Dollar, it's clear that we are at least a decade behind, and this is reflected in our prior performance levels and financial results. As we narrow the gap operationally, it will be realized in material improvements to our financial performance. As we get settled in, we are finding more and more opportunities to meaningfully improve both banners. \n Compared to just a few short months ago, the list of improvement opportunities has grown. Our guiding objective is to maximize returns to our shareholders. Doing so calls for implementing these initiatives with responsible urgency. There is no point in dialing. It has, over the months, become increasingly clear that our team's great experience gives us the opportunity to complete in just 3 to 5 years, most of what has taken far longer in other situations. \n Our merchants, stores and other teams are driving lots of initiatives, many of them with minimal investment. I will highlight some of these later. While these are already gaining traction, they will have the greatest impact, if supported by additional complementary investments. The stronger our associate team, the better the store conditions the more competitive our pricing, the more we will get out of them. There is a synergy across these initiatives and the complementary investments we are making with each enhancing the others. For this reason, we are accelerating and pulling forward our schedule of major high-returning investments. The cost of these investments is reflected in our 2023 outlook, as an incremental $430 million increase in SG&A, and the outlook assumes only a minimal return from these investments. The company is confident that these investments once implemented, will yield attractive returns in 2024 and beyond. \n While we are confident these operating expense investments will yield strong returns, we are also aware of the dynamic nature of the earliest stages of a turnaround. The many simultaneous moving pieces, the interdependence of many of these pieces and in current unusual dynamics in the economy. These considerations make forecasting the quarterly cadence of the benefits from these investments, particularly challenging. For this reason, for this first year of our transformation, we will consider these benefits only as they, in fact, materialize. \n This year's investments, which include the full year impact of investments made during fiscal 2022 are in several key areas in the following order of magnitude, labor and wages, including hourly wage rates and investments in field personnel, stores, through repairs and maintenance and improving store conditions, corporate, including technology and other initiatives. Under this new leadership team, we are increasing average hourly wages and estimated $2 for the 2-year period of 2022 and 2023. We feel that looking on a market-by-market basis and benchmarking to comparable retail wages, this investment will put us in a more competitive position. We also made additional investments in store hours and coverage, investments in our field labor and managers and other areas to help us execute much better. We expect these labor and wage investments will drive improved execution in our stores, higher sales, lower turnover, attraction of and retention of talent, reduce shrink and greater productivity and efficiency. \n Our associates and field personnel are critical to our transformation journey and we are excited about the investments in our talent. We are looking to invigorate the culture of this business, give our local operators and associates, the tools they need to execute and importantly provide them the opportunities they deserve to grow within our company. \n On store standards, we call last quarter, I spoke about an intense focus on store standards, our commitments to clean them up, straighten them up and fill them up. When we do this, our shoppers respond with a bigger basket and more importantly, with repeat visits. Our new COO, Mike Creedon, joined the team in October. Mike possesses a relentless focus on the 3 pillars of successful store operations, the work, the worker and the workplace. The work we must run efficient and productive stores. As a high transaction volume business, it's critical we have processes in place to get product onto our shelves quickly. I'm certain that we can't sell a product if it's in the back room. Approving efficiencies and workflows positively impacts our associate experience. \n The worker, as an organization must be a cornerstone that we support and enable our associates to be successful. This commitment will enhance our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain associates and contribute to their retail career development. We believe this focus, combined with our wage investments are contributing to the reduction in turnover that we are starting to see. The workplace and as we have indicated in the past, we must improve our store and DC conditions, and we are in the process of doing so. Frankly, stores and DCs were not being maintained up to our new leadership standards. We are actively transitioning from what we consider to be reactive to proactive maintenance approach. \n In addition to the work, the worker and the workplace, Mike's team are in the process of identifying certified GOLD stores for each region. GOLD stands for a Grand Opening Look Daily. These stores will serve as a clear, concise example for our district and store leadership teams across all regions so they have a distinct vision and understanding of what our most successful and well-run stores look like. \n On the question of our corporate investments, I will address these later in the call. Our merchandising teams led by Rick McNeely and [ Lara Gada ] are working hard. The Dollar Tree merchant team successfully managed through the transition to the $1.25 primary price point. As we cycle the majority of these stores throughout the fourth quarter, we saw a 410 basis point sequential improvement in traffic compared to quarter 3. \n Now that we have anniversaried the remainder of our stores in February, traffic is positive, and we are confident it will be a contributor to positive comps at Dollar Tree throughout the year. In 2022, we added $3 and $5 plus merchandise into more than 1,800 Dollar Tree stores. We plan to add this multiple price point product in another 1,800 or more stores in 2023. And when we begin flowing this multiple price product through 3 additional distribution centers, bringing our total to 7. \n Separately, we have been aggressively expanding our $3, $4, $5 frozen and refrigerated product across the Dollar Tree store base going from 0 to 3,500 stores in 2022. \n This consists of 3 cooler doors, 1 at each price point with an attractive selection of proteins, pizza, ice cream and more, which the customers are responding positively to. What we are seeing with Dollar Tree plus and multiple price frozen is that when the customer purchased at least one of these items, the basket size is more than double the basket with no multi-priced items. We are experiencing a more consistent and predictable slide chain. Stores were set well in advance for Valentine's Day, and we had terrific sell-through. The stores are now well prepared for the Easter season. And with $1.25 transition now behind us, we believe it's time for Dollar Tree merchants to get more creative than ever before. They have [ carved launch] to raise the bar on delighting customers and driving sales and all options are up for discussion. We believe doing what is easy has no reward. \n In addition to the opportunities at the Dollar Tree banner, we have a tremendous long-term opportunity to improve the operating performance at Family Dollar. We have a number of sales and margin-driving initiatives that are already underway, albeit in the early stages. But as you have seen, these have contributed to the 4.1% comp in quarter 3, followed by a 5.8% in quarter 4. Among our actions are the following: we have begun raising the shelf height to a 70-inch profile throughout the stores to enable us to broaden the product offering for our shoppers. This profit-enhancing initiative allows us to grow our SKU base by 1,000 items, including OTC and [HBA], without increasing our store-related costs. \n We are continuing to expand the number of cooler doors with plans to add 16,000 doors in 2023 to accommodate more frozen and refrigerated items. Our goal is to have 30 doors per store. Our shoppers rely on Family Dollar in their communities to provide these consumable base products to feed their families. We are replacing our control brands with private brands, and we will be introducing hundreds of national brand equivalent products in the back half of this year. These will include new labels and redefined labels, many of which are being developed in our new test kitchen here in Chesapeake, Virginia. \n To better meet both store and shopper needs, we are improving our ability to ship in [ ECS ], which improves inventory flow and profitability on slower moving, higher-margin items including the over-the-counter and health and beauty products. This enables us to be more nimble and provides greater flexibility. Additionally, we are working on improving Family Dollar productivity by enhancing end-cap displays, eliminating flex space and refining store adjacencies to better optimize the box. These are just a few examples that Larry's teams are focused on that we believe will contribute to Family Dollars improved sales trajectory in the sales ahead. \n We continue to be pleased with our positioning from a price perspective. We are at parity with key competitors and have widened the gap to grocery and drug. Shoppers have responded to the sharp pricing actions we took in late quarter 2 and third-party data suggest that Family Dollar is seeing an increasing amount of new customers in our stores. \n I will now turn the mic over to Jeff Davis, while Jeff has just been in his CFO seat at Dollar Tree since October, he is peddling fast and making great progress in a number of key strategic initiatives including leading the development of our long-term financial plan. Jeff will now provide more color on quarter 4 and what's ahead of us. Thank you, Jeff. As an organization, we are moving fast. Our operating initiatives are in flight and are gaining steam and the current economic climate is driving more higher income consumers into value retail. We believe we are in the right spot to deliver quality, value and convenience that shoppers need today. The momentum is continuing as both segments are off to a nice start early in quarter 1. \n Before we move to Q&A, I want to briefly discuss 2 additional contributors to our future success. Information technology and supply chain. In order to unlock the value creation opportunity ahead of us, we must have the right tools and technology in place to support our accelerated growth. [ Bobby Aflatooni's ] Technology Group has a clear vision and they are prioritizing projects that will have the greatest impact on our enhanced performance. Some of the increased speed fueling these projects, our capital expenditures and some are operating expenses. All of the projected spend for this year is captured and included in our outlook. \n And John Flanagan's supply chain team is doing a great deal of work to enhance efficiency and ensure the stores have the merchandise they need and can upstock it easily. We have identified an approach for eliminating the inefficiency of our current manual case-by-case handling process. This should enable us to more efficiently and reliably get products from our DCs onto our trucks and then into our stores. John has committed to having at least 1 DC up and running on the new process by the end of the year, which much more to come in 2024 and beyond. This will be a big step forward for our organization and especially for our store associates. \n Also, I would like to pat our DC teams on the back. In the past year, all 25 of our DCs have been good distribution practices certified by an independent third-party auditor, and we are already in the process to begin recertifying for 2023. The company is very proud of this achievement and believe it demonstrates our company's commitment to our associates to run good clean buildings. 2022 represented a year of substantial change for the Dollar Tree organization. Of the 16 officers listed on Dollar Tree's website, only 2 were with our company 15 months ago. That is clearly a great deal of change in a very short period of time. \n I would like to share my sincere gratitude to our 207,000 associates that have not only embraced change but have welcomed our new leaders and me to the organization. One day, we will be able to reflect on 2022 as the inflection point that got our company back on track. To capture the remarkable long-term value creation journey ahead of us. The team knows that I'm all in, in my commitment to support our store and field associates as they develop and grow in their retail careers by running full, clean and friendly stores to serve our shoppers each and every day. The long-term opportunity ahead of us is bigger than I imagined before I joined the Dollar Tree team. \n I want to be very clear. This transformation is not about saving dollars to deliver success. It's about spending dollars in the right places to unlock the future value of the business. This transformation is a process, which includes stabilizing the organization as we run and operate our business and make investments to modernize and transform the company to create long-term value for our stakeholders. \n As Jeff outlined, we pulled forward into 2023, certain investments that could otherwise have been extended for several years. And consequently, we expect fiscal 2023 to be a step back in earnings from the prior year. We're excited about this acceleration of initiatives and investments as it means higher and earlier returns in the years ahead. This is an important year to put us on a path for an acceleration in growth and earnings as we move forward. \n We believe that this approach will maximize returns for our shareholders. Our leaders are eager to share more details on our vision and the path to get there, and we will do so in a more structured format in our Investor Day here in Southeast Virginia, currently being planned for June. We intend for this to be the first of several events over the years ahead as we outline our transformation and its progress along the way. \n Before I turn it over to questions, I would like to take a moment on behalf of the employees, Board, shareholders to extend our thanks to Mike Witynski for his years of service and contributions. Mike, we're all grateful to you and wish you the best. Operator, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions. Thank you, Matt. Yes. The answer, Matt, is let's do the last 1 first, the $3 to $5. We're very pleased. And the key takeaway on that is not only selling the product but the store's ability to manage it the multiple price points and not create confusion for the customer, which is why we've taken the approach that everything is now on the table. So very pleased with that. \n The improvement, as I look at the improvement, it's not only the sales, but more importantly, the transaction count and what's going on in the basket. And we know that the basket is substantially larger when we get the multiple price points in it. So very -- we're pleased. We're excited. And now that we've cycled it, we're getting a true measure on what's going on. We'll spend a lot more time talking about that sort of thing at the Investor Day. And while I do not want to be specific, Family Dollar is starting to gain share. And it's also gaining a larger share of the wallet. Excellent question. I would look at '23 as kind of getting us level set -- and I think the investments we will utilize in '24 and '25 will be more basic. You're always investing in the business, but it won't be anything of the magnitude that we're tackling now. Another great question. The more time I spend here, I'll make a couple of observations for you, Scot. It's becoming really clear to me the composition of the new team married with the older team, there's a tremendous amount of experience here. And we believe that experience is going to help us drive -- to drive to get things done faster. Then you couple that with an organization the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree organization. I have never seen the willingness to accept change like I'm seeing here. \n The 207,000 people in this company are dying to be high performers, and they believe in what we're doing. And they're seeing -- are the investments we've made so far in price and wage, store investments we've made in terms of the quality of the facilities, the employees are seeing that they're seeing those changes. They're seeing them in sales and their viewing it as all positive. Yes. I mean I think as I reflect on what you're asking here, the most important thing we can do is maintain consistent store standards and execute against our operating model. We have -- we know what to do and I think if you look what's taking place, the consumer is responding to it and they're responding to it in terms of a bigger share of their wallet, they're responding in terms of market share. And all of the initiatives that we are putting in place, Krisztina, are all designed for that store experience. Even if you look at what we're doing with labor, we're not trying to take labor out of the store. We're trying to eliminate work so we could spend that on more customer-facing activities. Yes. I would say one of the key initiatives in this building is the in-stock level at Family Dollar. Several things are happening. A lot of the manufacturers have retailers on allocation. So if you order 100 cases, you might get 65. And that is affecting everybody right now. \n The other issue we are -- we have discovered, we've had for a long period of time is we use a perpetual inventory system and if that system is not right, if it's not showing the on-hand quantities properly, the system will order product. So we're going through a process now of truing that up but I will reiterate one of the -- and people are tired of me talking about it around here, in-stock is one of our key initiatives. Yes, sir. We're doing that market by market. And what we're looking at is not only the hourly wages, which is where the bulk of the investment is. We're also looking at coverage to ensure we have the proper amount of coverage and then we're also looking at what I would call the field team, the store manager and the district manager. We do know, and it's proven that when we have the right wage structure, we increased our retention and our turnover has been pretty astronomical and we're seeing that slow down. We know we get better shrink, we know we get better store standards and we get better morale. And that all leads to better execution, which the customer sees on the shelf when they're in the store. So it's a broad-based approach. Yes, great question. I think as I reflect on the consumables, the $3, $4 and $5 frozen food is a perfect example of there is a -- there's an appetite for it in the stores. I do think it's a balance, but I will say this, consumables drive transactions. And what we have to figure out is how to get a consumable item and a nonconsumable item in the basket together and grow the basket. And that's the challenge right now. So as we look at consumables, John, it's going to be a very selective approach. Hey, this sounds silly, but we introduced Bread into Dollar Tree over the last quarter. We put Ice in Dollar Tree over the last quarter, and they're doing very, very well. And we've done it without offsetting the mix in the store. So it's a methodical process. But I think what's important here is that it's nothing but opportunity if we can manage our way through it. It would only be a partial recovery. There's a number of factors to this. One, freight rates have not gone back to 2019 levels in its entirety. Also, as you think about freight, there are really 3 components of freight and everyone seems to want to focus only on the transatlantic portion. But there's import and -- I'm sorry, inbound and outbound freight also, which is ultimately included in all of this. And those particular rates you have not seen a significant reduction or return back to 2019 as driver costs, chassis costs, fuel, all those components continue to be at more elevated rates versus 2019. So as we look at these freight cost reductions in its entirety, we do not -- we're not forecasting this is going to recover that which we would have seen in comparison to 2019. Yes, I'll take that, Jeff, and then you can jump in. The first thing I want to say is we believe in the long-term earnings power of both banners and we think there's potential there, and I look forward to sharing that with everybody on the Analyst Day. I think if we are honest with ourselves, which we are, the facilities in both banners need work in terms of the quality of the gondolas, floor care, ceiling care, lights, I can go down the list that applies to both banners. \n I think when you look at the difference between the 2 banners and what shows up in one versus the other, in terms of store standards is Dollar Tree has no planograms in it. So it's incredibly easy just to put stuff on the shelf. And a lot of sins get covered up when you do that. Family dollar, every square inch of that thing when we get done by the middle of the year, we'll be playing to grant. And out of stocks, rusty shelves and more problems show up when you have a planogram based merchandising strategy. So I would look at you and say, both stores have a tremendous amount of opportunity. Both banners have a lot of long-term earnings power. So it's really not a balance. It's more about getting it done in both. Yes. I mean what we're seeing is the consumer making $80,000 a year is trading down. And that's -- timing is everything. We're doing better on so many fronts with a long way to go. They're having an experience they can relate to. But as far as planning for that in our outlook, no, we don't do that. So in terms of the composition of the basket, like every other consumable retailer, we're seeing the shift toward more consumables. I do think that -- So the basket is increasing. If I could add one thing. I think the key takeaway on what has been said is there is no structural problems with either [ Van ]. It's all fixable, and we know how to fix it."

            "name": "Jeffrey Davis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Unless otherwise stated, all fourth quarter comparisons are against the same period a year ago. In addition to my comments today, a supplemental slide deck that outlines several of our key operating metrics is available on our Investor Relations website. \n Operating income increased 6.8% to $618.1 million or 8% of total revenue a 20 basis point decline in operating margin. This was compared to a 70 basis point improvement in gross profit margin, which was more than offset by SG&A. Gross profit increased 11.6% to $2.39 billion. The Dollar Tree segment gross margin improved 110 basis points, primarily from higher initial mark-on, lower freight cost and sales leverage, partially offset by product mix, product cost inflation and higher costs for markdowns, shrink and distribution. \n Family Dollar's gross margin increased 20 basis points. This quarter represented Family Dollar's first improvement in gross margin in the last 7 quarters. The improvement was driven by higher initial mark-on, lower freight cost and leverage on occupancy, partially offset by mix, markdowns, shrink and higher distribution costs. \n SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased 80 basis points to 22.9%. The increase is due to a $23.9 million noncash store impairment charge along with elevated repairs and maintenance as part of our commitment to improve store and DC standards. Investments in store and distribution center hourly wages, and inflationary costs across several expense categories. Corporate support and other expenses were consistent at 1.4% of revenue. Net income was $452.2 million, and EPS was $2.04 in comparison to $2.01 a year ago. \n Moving to the balance sheet. My comments will reflect balanced comparisons at the end of Q4 2022 versus Q4 2021. Combined cash and cash equivalents totaled $643 million compared to $985 million. Inventory increased 24.8%, primarily from unit growth associated with early receipts of spring 2023 merchandise, Family Dollar combo expansion and new store unit growth and cost growth from product inflation, including freight, the expansion of the $1.25 and multi-price plus inventory. Units per store are at a similar level to pre-pandemic period. Our inventory is fresh, and we have limited dated inventory well within manageable levels. \n Capital expenditures were $328 million, in the fourth quarter versus $271.6 million. For fiscal 2023, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $2 billion. Of this $2 billion, we would characterize 39% is dedicated to business continuity with the remaining 61% for what we consider to be growth optimization and productivity improvement. The business continuity includes projects to run and operate our stores and DCs as well as enhanced safety and compliance programs. More specifically, this would include freezers and coolers, HVAC replacements and facility improvements for stores. DC conveyor projects and building improvements for our distribution facilities, enhance permanent cooling for our DCs and store safety and asset protection related projects. \n Our growth optimization and productivity improvement projects will include approximately 650 new stores, an estimated 1,000 store renovations, numerous distribution center projects and technology projects to enhance our efficiencies and support our growth. \n Our 2023 sales and EPS expectations incorporate a number of factors. First, this is a 53-week year. We expect this will benefit the fourth quarter by approximately $500 million in sales and $0.29 in diluted EPS. Second, we are cycling the outsized margin benefit for Dollar Tree's initial transition to the $1.25 price point where last year, it produced a 39% margin rate in the first half of 2022 as we evolved our assortments to the new price point. Also for both segments, we expect to see continued cost pressure from inflation and margin pressure from merchandise mix as consumables are expected to outpace discretionary sales. Third, our outlook includes a benefit of approximately $1 per share from reduced freight expenses with nearly all of that benefit realized in the second half. Approximately half of our fiscal 2023 import container volume will remain at existing long-term contracts or charters at elevated rates. \n We anticipate meaningfully lower rates for renegotiated contracts and spot volumes, which we expect to impact the remaining half of our container volume for the year. These factors limit the impact of lower freight rates on operating profits within the year. The Dollar Tree segment will realize approximately 80% of these freight savings, which will support a gross margin rate in the range of 36% to 37% in fiscal 2023. If current market conditions persist, we expect an additional freight cost relief of approximately $1 in fiscal 2024 and 2025 with the majority realized in fiscal 2024. \n Four, our outlook includes approximately $430 million or $1.45 per share in operating expenses across labor and wages, store repairs and maintenance and corporate as we accelerate our investments to transform this company. These investments are roughly split evenly between the 2 banners and include investments in corporate. Given the amount of transformational activity, initiative interdependencies and the volatility of economic environment, it is difficult to precisely estimate the timing and related magnitude of investment returns. \n Our 2023 outlook assumes only a minimal benefit from these investments. Company is confident that these investments, once implemented, will yield attractive returns in 2024 and beyond. There is strong evidence in the back half of 2022 that management's actions and investments are already yielding results at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree as evidenced by our recent trends. While our outlook assumes minimal profit contribution from Family Dollar this year, we believe there is tremendous opportunity to improve Family Dollar sales productivity and margins and we are confident this opportunity will realize and produce meaningful profits in the years ahead. \n Finally, we will continue to focus on people, store conditions, tools and technology to drive growth and long-term operating performance improvements. We expect SG&A expense dollars, which includes general inflation, new store expenses and accelerated investments as well as the 53rd week to grow in the low teens. Based on the confluence of these factors, we anticipate year-over-year gross and operating margins will decline in the first half of 2023, followed by growth in the second half. We estimate 2023 EPS will be comprised of approximately 40% in the first half and approximately 60% in the second half which includes 1 extra week in Q4. \n Consolidated net sales for the full year fiscal 2023 are expected to range from $29.9 billion to $30.5 billion. We expect a low to mid-single-digit comp store sales increase for the year, comprised of a low single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a mid-single-digit increase in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow from 3% to 3.5%. \n Our new store openings this year will be more back end weighted compared to 2022. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $6.30 and $6.80. For Q1, we forecast consolidated net sales will range from $2.7 billion (sic) [ $7.2 billion ] to $7.4 billion based on a mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for Q1 are estimated to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.56. While share repurchases are not included in the outlook, we had $1.85 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of January 28. \n Other modeling considerations for the 2023 outlook include the following: we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $845 million to $850 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million in Q1 and $97 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.25% to 24.5% for the first quarter and for the fiscal 2023 period. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 222.4 million shares for Q1 and 222.6 million shares for the full year. \n I'll now turn the call back to Rick. Thank you, Michael. This is Jeff. As we think about the returns, and Rick had indicated earlier, there are a number of interdependencies that are related to these investments. So as you can imagine, we are a lot of these investments are complementary to what we're doing with our merchandising and our other store initiatives. Those interdependencies are dependent upon us being able to execute against this against all 16,000 stores, and it will take time through the course of 2023 to accomplish that. We have seen early on at the back half of 2022, some early returns and some tests that we've done. So we're confident that we will have an improvement in returns in future years. \n But between the interdependency as well as, quite honestly, trying to execute this and what we are all seeing as a somewhat uncertain macroeconomic environment. The combination of these 2 things, we believe that the impacts of this year will be minimal. We're saying it is minimal because it is not any relevant level for us to actually speak any specifics to it at this point in time. Good, sir. Yes. So there's a couple of pieces to this. First off, our teams are always going back to our supplier partners and looking for ways to reduce our costs where that is available. And to the extent that later they are and given our volumes and sort of our scale to the extent that we can do so, we'll take advantage of that. But part of the challenge also for us is that a large portion of our contracts, about 60% of all the contracted business that we have for any particular year right now. About 60% of that is long-term charter or contracted rates. And that's the reason why those contracts and charters do not roll off until starting late 2024 or 2025. \n The other element of this is that we capitalize our freight into our inventory cost. So in any one particular year, to the extent that our inventory is turning, let's say, 4x, you've got that portion that is going to roll over to the next year as part of your capitalized cost. So the combination of those things, so it's going to be the timing of contract expiration and renegotiation. It's going to be the carryover from 1 year to the next are the 2 reasons why for us, we have more of a back-ended loaded benefit of freight in 2023 that we'll be carrying over into 2024. But then also, you have a further continuation of freight cost reductions as those other contracts roll off. I appreciate your question because I realized I didn't answer the $430 question earlier, so I apologize. Of the $430 million, about 2/3 of that is related to wage and wage-related items. The delta, if you will, is around setting the store standards, what we're doing in sort of standards that we're doing IT, what we're doing in our supply chain. As it relates to our wage rates of $2, it definitely brings us more competitive in the marketplace as it closes the gap. We believe that, once again, it's not only closing the gap on hourly wages, but then it's also for us collectively bringing us more competitive as it relates to the field leadership teams. We haven't provided any sort of average hourly rate, but it is about a 20% increase over the course of the 2 years that $2 would represent. So there's 2 things, if I could maybe add to that. One, as it relates to the -- one, quality of merchandising, the opportunities we're presenting. But also from a pricing perspective, the work that we've done, there's been a multipoint reduction against the market, if you will, in our pricing to gain parity as Mike -- excuse me, as Rick has said, with respect to our competitive sets as well as widening the gap of grocery and convenience. So the combination of those 2 things is very encouraging for us as it relates to improved traffic as well as being able to drive still ticket at those lower prices on a year-over-year basis. And then as it relates to Family Dollar and its ability to generate greater levels of profitability, there is somewhat of a step function that's going on right now with these accelerated investments. And it's more exacerbated against Family Dollar P&L because of its overall unit economics versus that of Dollar Tree, as you well recognized. \n We believe that as we continue to drive greater productivity from a top line perspective, improve -- simplify our stores and its operating procedures such that we can further leverage off of the existing base that we're building up. We believe that we will be able to drive higher levels of profitability. The last piece is from a margin perspective, gross margin perspective, the things that Larry is doing, we're talking about from a private label additions that, that will also help us from a gross margin. So top line sales, gross margin improvement and then leverage against some of these expenses that we are now incurring over the longer period of time."

Today's call is being recorded.  \n At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Randy Guiler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss results for Dollar Tree's Third Fiscal Quarter 2022. With me on today's call are Executive Chairman, Rick Dreiling; President and CEO, Mike Witynski; and CFO, Jeff Davis.  \n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about our expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements.  \n For information on the risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the Risk Factors, Business and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in our annual reports on Form 10-K filed March 15, 2022, our Form 10-Q for the most recently ended fiscal quarter, our most recent press release and Form 8-K and other filings we make from time to time with the SEC. We caution against reliance on these forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements, except as may be required by law.  \n Following our prepared remarks, Mike and Jeff will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]  \n I will now turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Randy. And good morning, everyone. In my short time here, I have been incredibly impressed with the team's overall enthusiasm and willingness to accept and embrace much needed change. As I stated last quarter, we are making change happen to create long-term shareholder value and enable the next wave of profitable growth for Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.  \n The company is moving at a rapid pace. We have done a remarkable job of rebuilding our executive team and with retail thought leaders that are subject matter experts and eager to be part of this transformational journey that we have embarked on. In a short period of time, all of our C-suite positions have been filled as well as new leadership roles dedicated to a number of key areas, including diversity, sustainability, compliance and communication. Last quarter, we shared news of the material price investments made at Family Dollar. These actions got on price parity with key competitors and widen our spread to grocery and drug stores. Customers are recognizing this commitment to value, which contributed to a 4% comp sales increase and the segment's first quarterly traffic increase in 3 years.  \n The teams are focused on improving store standards. They are committed to clean them up, straighten them up and fill them up. Improving sales productivity is a vital component of the Family Dollar turnaround, and we are extremely focused on driving sales per square foot, unit sales growth and transaction count growth. We are a company with more than 16,200 stores. But the way I prefer to look at this is that we are really 2 growth companies with 8,100-plus stores each. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are unique businesses with 2 different go-to-market strategies. Having 2 distinct large segments provides us flexibility like none other in value retail and both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have extraordinary opportunity for growth and improvement over time.  \n We are prioritizing our areas of growth, and we are moving with urgency. The new management team is in-house. We've taken aggressive action on price. The advertising and marketing cadence has been enhanced. We are in the midst of a cultural transformation throughout the organization, designed to enhance our associate and customer experience. Store standards are improving. Years of sales productivity opportunities are ahead of us and work on supply chain and technology initiatives will enhance us to achieve our ultimate goals. I know many are eager to learn more about all of our plans, including the timing, the magnitude and the expected returns. These details will be shared at our spring Investor Day in a more structured format as our new leadership team has assembled more time together.  \n We are entirely committed on taking the right steps to transform this organization for the long-term. On behalf of our directors, I want to thank each of our associates for their commitment, dedication and effort, especially for their willingness to embrace much needed change. This is a journey that I am thrilled to be part of.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you have seen in recent months, we have announced a number of executives have joined Dollar Tree. I am excited about the caliber and quality of the leadership team we now have in place. This team will lead our company through the next evolution of growth. We are committed to transforming our culture, meeting our shoppers and associates' needs, improving store productivity and efficiencies and delivering improved long-term operating results.  \n I am pleased with the team's efforts to deliver solid results for the quarter. Our third quarter sales performance reflects the timely execution of merchandising initiatives to drive our consumables business in this uncertain and inflationary environment. Same-store sales for both segments improved from the prior quarter and delivered sequential monthly improvement throughout the quarter. Shoppers are responding to our new value proposition at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree as we focus on driving both traffic and store productivity.  \n With the exception of Q1 and Q2 of 2020 at the initial onset of the pandemic, our 6.5% enterprise comp represents our best quarter since the Family Dollar acquisition. By segment, the comp was comprised of an 8.6% increase for Dollar Tree and a 4.1% increase for Family Dollar. In recent quarters, we refined our strategies at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to focus on the traffic-driving consumables side of the business. Our transition to the $1.25 price point has enabled our merchants to greatly enhance value for our shoppers. For the second consecutive quarter, our consumables comp outpaced the discretionary comp at Dollar Tree. The team delivered a 9.3% comp on consumables with key contributors being in food and beverage, snack and cookies and candy.  \n Family Dollar consumables increased 4.7% on a comp basis. Despite the ticket headwinds related to our price actions in Q2, shoppers are clearly recognizing the greater value and are responding to our enhanced advertising initiatives. Importantly, at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we saw an acceleration in comp performance throughout the quarter, with October being our strongest month.  \n We have a number of key sales-driving initiatives to drive productivity. For Dollar Tree stores, we are continuing to exceed the customer's expectation for value, our merchants do a tremendous job of effectively managing the ever-changing assortment that wows our shoppers, expanding our $3 and $5 offering into more stores. We ended the quarter with our plus assortment in nearly 30% of our Dollar Tree stores, and we'll continue to aggressively expand this initiative in the years ahead. We are currently refining our $3 and $5 assortment as our team operates in an environment of continuous improvement based on learnings. We are developing our frozen assortment to meet our shoppers' family needs as they are looking to save money by dining at home. We are aggressively expanding our offerings of protein, pizza, breakfast items and family sizes at price points that meet their budgets.  \n We will continue to focus on winning the season. Dollar Tree is a destination for shoppers looking to celebrate holidays, events and seasons. Our offering will be better than last year but not as good as next year as we continue to improve our assortments. Family Dollar, from a pricing perspective, is in the best position in more than a decade. Now that we have taken action to reestablish price parity, we are committed to maintaining our competitiveness.\n  Other Family Dollar initiatives designed to improve sales per square foot, unit sales and transaction count include: improving our store layouts through improved adjacency flow, adding linear square footage, expanding immediate consumption DSD categories and optimizing the beverage and frozen food offering. Developing private brands, we are in the process of growing and improving our private brand performance by providing shoppers more choices and a broader offering of quality products at a greater value. Over time, we believe this will enhance customer loyalty as well as our margin profile.  \n We are refining our marketing effectiveness to provide customers with convenience, value, variety and an improved shopping experience. We have evolved our print advertising calendar and format to be more relevant to our customers to drive their visit frequency. We are also in the process of relaunching our Smart Coupon program, designed to improve quality, availability, clip rate and redemptions. \n In this changing and dynamic environment, we feel we are implementing the right plans to drive sales productivity, enhance margins and improve efficiencies to enhance the long-term benefits to each of our stakeholders. In October, Jeff Davis joined Dollar Tree as our new CFO. Jeff brings more than 30 years of financial leadership to the organization with much of his experience coming from large retailers, including Walmart, JCPenney and Darden. Jeff is very much focused on value creation through strategic growth and strategic decision support as well as value preservation through governance and efficiency in operations. Jeff has been the company for nearly 2 months, but he is making a difference already. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff to provide more color on Q3 and what's ahead of us. \nJeffrey Davis: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I am delighted to join the Dollar Tree team at such a pivotal time. I've been in my seat for almost 8 weeks, and I have experienced tremendous energy and excitement across the entire organization as the team is an embracing change. While the company has been around for decades, I believe we are in the early phase of significantly improving our long-term operating performance. In October, I had an opportunity to meet several of you at store visits and I look forward to connecting with a larger group in the near future. More details to come.  \n Since Mike and Rick already covered our third quarter sales results, I will now move directly to the discussion of operating income. Unless otherwise stated, all third quarter comparisons are against the same period last year. To supplement my comments, we are introducing a quarterly presentation on our website at corporate.dollartree.com/investors, which outlines several key operating metrics. We hope you will find this additional information helpful to better understand our business. \n Operating income increased 22.8% to $381.3 million or 5.5% of total revenue, a 70 basis point improvement in operating income margin. This was led by a 240 basis point improvement in gross profit margin, partially offset by a 170 basis point increase in our SG&A expense rate.  \n Gross profit increased 17.5%. The Dollar Tree segment gross margin improved 520 basis points, primarily from higher initial mark-on related to the move to $1.25 price point, lower freight costs and sales leverage, partially offset by greater penetration of lower-margin consumable merchandise and product cost inflation.  \n Family Dollar's gross margin declined 100 basis points, largely due to a product mix shift and product cost inflation. We expect to see continued pressure across both segments related to the inflationary cost environment and merchandise mix as our consumable sales are expected to continue outpacing discretionary.  \n SG&A as a percentage of total revenue increased 170 basis points to 24.4%. The increase is principally related to elevated repairs and maintenance as part of our commitment to improve store standards, investments in store hourly wages and higher inflationary costs across a number of expense categories, including utilities.  \n Corporate support and other expenses increased 30 basis points to 1.4%, primarily from increased stock compensation expense, higher incentive comp and professional fees. From a bottom line basis, net income improved 23.1% to $266.9 million or $1.20 per diluted share in comparison to $0.96 per diluted share last year.  \n Moving to the balance sheet. My comments reflect balanced comparisons to the end of Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021. Combined cash and cash equivalents totaled $439 million compared to $701 million. The reduction in cash is largely attributed to the repurchase of approximately 2.86 million shares for $397.5 million in Q3 of this year. Inventory increased 31.1%, primarily from inflationary product and freight costs, expansion of $1.25 in multi-price plus inventory and store growth. Also recall last year, shoppers pulled forward purchases well ahead of the holiday season, concerned about product availability, while we were chasing trans-specific deliveries of discretionary products as our inventory levels dip well below normal operating levels. This year, shoppers purchasing behavior appears to be more closely timed to holiday dates.  \n Finally, unit counts are at similar levels to October 2019. Our inventory is fresh. We have limited-dated inventory well within manageable levels. Capital expenditures were [ $391.2 million ] in the third quarter versus $295.6 million last year. For fiscal 2022, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $1.2 billion.  \n As we look to Q4, we see the following affecting our business. We will anniversary a significant number of Dollar Tree stores, approximately 2,500 in December and 3,000 in January, the transition to the $1.25 price point a year ago. We previously experienced an outsized benefit to comps and margins associated to the transition. The economy continues to pressure middle and low household income customers, resulting in needs-based purchasing. We expect consumables to outperform discretionary, which negatively impacts gross margin. We are cycling advanced child tax credit payments which were distributed mid-month from July to December in 2021.  \n On a year-over-year basis, we are facing higher costs from suppliers related to this inflationary environment. While at Family Dollar, we do have the flexibility to adjust price. At Dollar Tree, where we are at a fixed price points, it takes us time to adjust quantities and pack sizes for cost changes, which can lead to near-term pressure to margins. We will continue to invest in store and DC standards and expect to have higher year-over-year expenses in repairs and maintenance. In addition to being right on price, we will be right on wage as it continues to be a competitive market for talent.  \n We are raising our sales outlook for the year. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $28.14 billion to $28.28 billion compared to our previous outlook range of $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit comp sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase at Dollar Tree stores and a low single-digit increase in Family Dollar. Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 2.8% as we are experiencing supply chain delays related to procuring equipment and fixtures for store openings.  \n For Q4, we estimate consolidated net sales will range from $7.54 billion to $7.68 billion based on a mid- to high single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. At the end of Q2, we expected fiscal 2022 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.40. Due to several factors, including, but not limited to, an acceleration of consumable product mix shift and elevated product cost pressure, we expect to be in the lower half of the previous outlook range.  \n Other considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following: we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million. Net interest expense is expected to be $30 million in Q4 and $127 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate up 24.3% for the fourth quarter and 23.7% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 222.3 million shares for Q4 and 224.2 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. As of October 29, we had $1.85 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.  \n I'll now turn the call back to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thanks, Jeff. I am proud of our team's efforts. During a period of material organizational change, a disruptive hurricane through the Southeast and macro uncertainty contributing to the highest inflation in 40 years, we delivered increases of 8.1% in sales, 17.5% in gross profit, 22.8% in operating profit and an increase of 25% in EPS. Our results continue to reinforce the relevance of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to millions of households across North America.  \n As you know, in late June, we announced that a number of executive positions would be changed. I am proud to share that by mid-November, all seats are filled, and we are very confident in the outstanding team we have built. All additions have been successful leaders throughout their careers and bring new, fresh perspectives and will enhance our progress. In addition to the executive changes, last week, we announced new leaders for several key areas of the business, including diversity, sustainability, compliance and communications. I am very confident in the team we have developed and that it will enable us to accelerate progress on our transformational journey.  \n In the months ahead, we will be refining and prioritizing our plans to ultimately deliver improved operating performance across both segments. At our spring Investor Day, we will provide you with more transparent and comprehensive view into the opportunity ahead us and the path to get there.  \n Before we transition to Q&A, I want to sincerely share my gratitude to our associates, especially in Florida and the Carolinas for their efforts during Hurricane Ian at the end of September. Their efforts through the preparation for and the recovery from this devastating storm was critical to countless families and communities we serve. In many cases, our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores were among the first to reopen to assist customers with products they needed most. Thank you to each of you. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. So maybe first question. At Family Dollar, could you elaborate on the drivers of sequential improvement as the quarter progressed? How much do you think more so of this is tied to the macro or the value trade down behavior versus inning do you think that your company-specific initiatives are in today at Family Dollar? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think it's a combination of everything that you're seeing going on, the pressure on the customer. And then our merchandising team invested the investment we made in getting our prices right to be at parity in the marketplace and then as well as writing more impactful ads and more frequency of our ads. So I think stronger promotion, stronger base pricing and then the work on the assortment in our [ H2.5 ], I think, is meeting the overall macro impact that the customer is seeing on the pressure that they have to try and meet the budget each and every day.  \n I think that on a customer, we're seeing -- we're seeing continued pressure. We're -- as I've shared, we're seeing more customers come into our segment. And once they're in our segment, these are -- the majority of the customers are at [ 80,000 ] and higher household income. But even once they're inside the store, we're seeing shifts in their behavior where they're very consumable and needs-based focused to try and make that budget work and stretch it over the month.  \n We're seeing private brands now for 39 weeks in a row have outpaced national brands, 39 weeks in a row. We have not seen that the prior 5 to 7 years where private brands were outpacing national brands, but it's now been 39 years in a row -- or 39 weeks in a row, I'm sorry. And then we're seeing first in a month business is getting stronger. We're seeing our SNAP and food stamp business is growing, and we continue to see credit as outpacing debit.  \n So we do see that shift in the customer coming into our segment, and then when they're in our store, they are shifting into the consumables and needs based to make their budget happen. And I think the work that our merchants are doing are absolutely aligned and helping drive meeting their needs when they're in our store. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then just at the Dollar Tree banner, what's your overall assessment to date on breaking the box overall? And can you speak to sequential trends with traffic to the banner that you're seeing? Or what's been the reception to Dollar Tree Plus or the rollout of the $3 and the $5 SKUs across the assortment? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. I'll start with $1.25. I think overall, our traffic has been very stable, and we saw a slight improvement in Q3 in traffic. But what was more important is throughout 2020 and 2021, our consumable sales continued to decline quarter after quarter because of the product availability and the assortment we just couldn't provide for the customer at that dollar price point. Once we move to the $1.25 throughout this year, our merchant teams have worked hard at bringing in that new assortment, and we have absolutely change that trend. And instead of declining business in consumables it's now accelerating and leading the growth and I believe over time, that will continue to drive traffic into our stores and Dollar Tree.  \n So what I'm really excited about is for the second quarter in a row, consumables have outpaced our discretionary business, and it was 9.3%, 9.4% comp sales, but discretionary is still doing well at over 8%. So we like the business and the reaction we're seeing from the customers based on us being able to have a better assortment at greater values on products they need. And I think as we continue to provide that, that will help stabilize our traffic in the long-term going forward.  \n On the $3 and $5, we're seeing great response from our customers, especially on the seasonal side of the product. And that's where we think we can continue to refine and grow that business. And then as well, you've also heard us on the frozen food part at the $1.25, with the cost pressures, it's even hard for us to get a great value assortment at $1.25. So we've moved to multi-price products in our frozen food set. It's easier to communicate to our customers and our associates because it's door by door. And our -- and that assortment, as I've shared, the customers are responding greatly.  \n And again, this is our frozen business for the last 18 months was in a decline because of the same pressures we were seeing on the consumables. And now we've completely reversed that where we have introduced the multi-price $3 and $5 items, customers are responding well, and we see strong growth in our sales there. So I think between the 2 of those things, the consumables side and then the frozen side, over time, we will continue to drive traffic doing.  \n And then on the discretionary side, proven by our continued growth and a 8% comp, the customers still see the value in our seasonal party, toys, crafting and that continues to be strong. So I like the trends we're seeing overall. \nOperator: We will take the next question from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. \nScot Ciccarelli: So can you talk about the consumable versus discretionary mix at both banners? It seems like there's a concerted effort to focus more on consumables. Obviously, that helps with traffic, but is margin dilutive. So I guess the question is, how do you guys expect to manage that balance, #1? And then #2, when would you expect the mix pressures to start to ease? Is there like, I guess, a certain target you're kind of shooting for? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. And you're right. Right now, we're meeting the needs where the customer is taking us, and we are improving that assortment. And I'll speak to Family Dollar. Larry got and the merchants have done a wonderful job at really improving that assortment and that pricing for that customer where they need us. And it's all in that consumable and DSD-related product. And we've done that not only in our base pricing, but our promotion pricing and then also in the linear footage dedicated to it, our resets in our 2.5.  \n So you're right. I think our biggest goal to drive improvement on the Family Dollar side is to get more sales per square foot in our boxes. And the first thing is driving it with consumables and being right on that. But the team is also, at the same time, really working on discretionary to be right on seasonal and home to meet their needs, but really, it's the consumables driving that trade over more than our effort and the works that we're doing on the merchandising side.  \n And then on the Dollar Tree side, just as I've shared, I like what I've seen in the last 2 quarters where one is up 9.5%, the other one is 8%. That's a great balance. And I think, as we continue to provide that value on the consumables side, I think over time, we like when both are 50%-50%, 50%, say, discretionary and 50% consumables. And then as they grow over time, I think like Dollar Tree historically, has always grown low single-digit comps with a combination of traffic and units in the basket. And I think once we settle and cycle through that, providing that effort on the consumables side, we'll get back to that normal cadence that we've seen in the past. \nScot Ciccarelli: So just from an earnings algorithm perspective, I'm not asking specific guidance for next year, is it fair to assume kind of lower gross margin, buy maybe more SG&A leverage on kind of a go-forward basis maybe than what we've seen historically, just given the mix shift? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. This is Jeff. Absolutely, from a standpoint of, given the mix shift and some of the other cost pressures, margin is much more under pressure. But given the increase in revenue, the opportunity to leverage our SG&A is definitely there. \nMichael Witynski: And I would just say, too, the other thing is, as Family Dollar continues to prove their execution and drive market share in these products in DSD and national brands and then even in our private brands, vendor rebates and allowances will follow that because we're executing better. And Larry's team is really working hard on trying to drive that. So it's really even the mix within the mix as consumables grow, there's levers that we can pull with allowances and rebates and then mix in the private brands as that consumer shifts to that should help with some of the margin pressure, too. \nOperator: We will take the next question from line of Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I wanted to ask you just to go a little deeper. On the private brands, where do you see the most opportunity? Like what maybe categories and where that you're focused on and where you think you can drive some incremental improvement quickly? \nMichael Witynski: I believe across the board. And Larry's team, we have staffed up. We've brought in additional experts in this area on the private brand for Family Dollar. On the OTC and health, over-the-counter drug and health is where we're going to be focused and leaning in first. And of course, on the paper side of it, we think there's opportunity and then just on the everyday food side. So those would be the 3 big areas. \n And I think Larry's team, we're organizing around it. We're looking at the brands and driving penetration by category comparing to the rest of the market. And we've partnered with a third-party broker to really help accelerate that. So those would be the 3 big areas, and it's a huge focus for Larry and his team. \nJoseph Feldman: That's great. And if I could follow up with maybe a bigger picture question. I think as Rick had said in his prepared remarks that you view the company as kind of 2 really strong growth companies under one roof and -- which I guess is not too different from the past, but it does imply that there's 2 different go-to-market strategies, which we know and ways of doing business. \n So I'm wondering how do you guys leverage the scale of the overall company and the operations? And like has anything changed with that strategy to have these combined fulfillment centers and purchasing power being stronger? Maybe you can just give a little more color on that? \nRichard Dreiling: I'll lead with that if that's okay. Hey, what I would say is the things that -- how we go to market, how we face the customer between the 2 banners are totally different. One is basic consumable retailing, the Family Dollar side. One is consistent everyday low price, one price point. The leverage, the beauty of the combination is all of the backside things that the consumer doesn't experience, the accounting, the HR, the legal. And that's where all those synergies exist even on the supply chain, how we deliver to the stores, how we look at this [ model ]. So all of those synergies are still there. \n But what we're doing a much different -- what I would think not only different but better job is with how we're facing the consumer realizing that, one is more emotional driven and then again, one is more concerned with everyday excitement value. Michael, I'll turn it over to you on that. \nMichael Witynski: No. I think you stated it right. Well, the customer-facing side is where we're leveraging, but on the back side, we'll be leveraging all the opportunities we can as one organization. \nOperator: We will take the next question from line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. \nJohn Heinbockel: A couple of questions on Family Dollar merchandising. So one, given the size of the box, how do you think about product breadth versus depth, that fundamental tension? And do you need to accelerate cooler capacity as part of the process? And then lastly, I know you're working on supply chain, right, to try to improve out of stocks. How quickly do you think that begins to impact the business, right? Is that kind of 6 months out, a year out, maybe not that long, [ your thoughts ] would be great. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. So I'll start with the breadth and depth of Family Dollar. Again, Larry and his team is going category by category, and he's already made changes in our new H2.5, but that will be a continuous improvement throughout this next year, as him and his team apply that discipline and strategy to each category, we will be bringing in more SKUs where it makes sense to help meet the needs of the customer and comparing it to the rest of the market. And where we've done that in the categories that he's done so far, we're seeing great results in it. And I think that's why we're excited about our 2.5. \n We're also using our linear space more. We're putting in more shelves inside the box and then we can go vertically higher in the gondolas, the [ rows ] of shelving that we have right now. And again, that allows us to bring in more assortment into the store and getting more sales per square foot. \n The cooler is absolutely an improvement. And every time we remodel a store, we want to bring in more coolers, both cool beverage and frozen beverage because that's where the customer is moving to. And it's a convenience item and it's meeting their needs. So there is room for continued expansion there. And Larry's and his team has even really look at a reset for the whole frozen food set, and where we've rolled that out going into this back half of the year. So that's going to be a continuous improvement side. \n And on the supply chain, I would say we're constantly looking at the enabling our supply chain, as Rick said, to try and drive efficiencies and making it easier for our stores. And we're seeing improvements right now on things that we're doing in our supply chain. So I think it's -- you'll see it now throughout the next 2 to 3 years on how do we continue to refine our supply chain as a key enabler to drive the efficiencies and make it easier for our stores to get the product in the stores more efficiently. \nOperator: We will take the next question from the line of Ed Kelly from Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: I wanted to ask about the Dollar Tree gross margin. You've hinted in the past that this potentially could be higher than 36% over time. I think if I try to sort of like look at where you're run rating now based upon the commentary around a little bit of incremental pressure in Q4, maybe you're run rating sort of high 35% range. Just thoughts around that. \n And then as we think about next year, you do get a big freight benefit likely. How do you think about investing that versus letting that flow through? And I asked that question because the consensus is probably in the high 37% range for next year. And this sort of all boils down to what do you think the right margin is for this business to provide value to customers while also delivering for shareholders? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Thank you for the question. If you think about our margins right now and as we think about it move forward, it's really driven by what the customer is really leading into and buying. So right now, we're seeing a little more rotation into our consumables versus our discretionary, but yet you're seeing good growth on both sides. We like the balance of that. \n We're doing a number of things to continue to provide value to the customer and maintain that margin rate as best we can, recognizing right now that we're still under some level of product cost pressures as well as from a freight component, but still being able to deliver, as you said, high mid-30s types of margin rates. \n As we move forward, we will continue to look to deliver value to the customer across both of those broad categories of discretionary and consumables. We believe that a number of things that we're doing with a multi-price point will allow us to lean into the discretionary even more and hopefully continue to balance out that end of the business also. So it's really a combination of the two. And it depends on how the customer is in their behaviors and their needs, and we are able to provide them across that broad continuum. \nOperator: We will take the next question from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Jeff, just within your last answer, you mentioned mid-30% gross margin moving forward for the Dollar Tree banner. The Dollar Tree banner has $0.5 billion of costs that were negatively impacted from all the significant amount of freight and transportation over the last few years, especially container costs. Container costs are now back to where they were in 2019 levels. \n So understanding that there could be some mix pressure as the consumer focuses on consumables, why would you not get a more significant benefit to Dollar Tree's gross margin from the significant decline in freight cost moving into next year? Should we interpret that to mean that you have to make more sizable investments in Dollar Tree in order to maintain the sales productivity of that banner, especially now that you see how those stores that were early to raise prices last year are performing once they lap that? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. As I look at this, there is definitely the opportunity as freight rates start to turn back around. That -- we are on contract. Most of our business we do is on contracted carriers versus spot rates. So there's going to be a little bit of a lag in that timeframe. And at this point, we're not giving any guidance for 2023 as of yet. But to the extent that we continue to see the freight rates and the other transpacific rates coming down and staying down, that will be reflected in our longer-term contract rates. \n We will then have the opportunity to balance that with giving back to the customer as well as the shareholder. But having said that -- that's only one component. The other component is underlying product cost. And right now, there is as much pressure and many times in the product cost, underlying vendor product costs as there is in freight. So we have to balance the 2. And definitely keep an eye on, in my mind, is how we create value for the overall organization is balancing that in being priced right in the marketplace for our customer as well as providing a higher return to our shareholders. \nMichael Lasser: And if I could just follow up on that, Jeff. As of November 2022, you have 312 stores that are now anniversarying the rollout of the $1.25 price point from last year. Are those stores comping positively in the range with the rest of the Dollar Tree banner performance? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. So we're in the new quarter here, we're not going to give you intra-quarter guidance. And it's really early for us to tell. So I think that when we release our fourth quarter results, we'll be able to tell you a little bit more about that. \nOperator: We will take the next question from the line of Michael Montani from Evercore. \nMichael Montani: Yes. Just wanted to ask, first off, if I could, on the SG&A side. If there's level of comp that you feel you need for natural leverage into the fourth quarter and into 2023 in order to lever some of the expenses there? And then a follow-up. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Michael, it's a good question. It's one in which -- what would be a natural level to leverage in normal circumstances versus what we are doing, as we had mentioned earlier, a good focus, continued focus and commitment around elevating our store standards investing in not only store standards, but our wage rates for our stores. We're -- and the combination of the two, we have been making some material investments. But if you look over a period of time, we've been able to leverage our SG&A, if you will, on about a 2% to 3% comp. \nMichael Montani: Okay. And then if I could just follow up on CapEx. The past few years, it was trending around $8 a foot. In this year, it looks like it could be north of $9. So given some of the inflationary components there and the investments you all are making, is that kind of the right baseline that $9 plus to build off of? Or should we think of this as maybe some more catch-up that could subside? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Once again, I don't want to give any guidance beyond 2022 other than what we've provided. The investments that we're making this year and technology and supply chain on top of our normal base is what's really driving the increase. And we believe it's the right thing to do as we set up for the right capabilities for us to accelerate our growth going forward. \nOperator: We will take the next question from line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Jeff, on the implied fourth quarter guide, can you help us think about the segments where you see more margin compression relative to the third quarter? It looks like you're anticipating operating margins to be down about 30 basis points or so. They were up about 70 basis points in the third quarter on a similar comp. So just wondering if you hold our hands on the segment for 4Q a little bit? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. We historically have not given guidance necessarily on a banner basis. We look at it in total, the pressure that we're seeing is, once again, the continued rotation in the consumables and how the customer is responding there as well as we know that we are continuing to see other inflationary cost pressures across the P&L. But all of this is more -- was anticipated back when we gave our earlier guidance, it's really the product mix shift that is the predominant sort of driver of our -- sort of direction around the lower half of the range. \nMichael Witynski: And the continued pressure on cost. \nCharles Grom: Okay. Great. And a follow-up question for Rick and Mike. Obviously, the price investments a few months ago were smart. I'm curious when you think out over the next couple of years and the next big levers you can pull to improve productivity, I guess, what should we be thinking about? Mike you touched on it a little bit in terms of raising the gondola heights adding coolers. But I guess, maybe a little bit of looking inside the playbook on what to expect? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, I would say that... \nRichard Dreiling: Go ahead, Mike. I'm sorry. \nMichael Witynski: Yes, I would say... \nRichard Dreiling: Go ahead, brother, I'm sorry. Bye-bye. Go. \nMichael Witynski: Rick opened up, let's to clean it up, fill it up and straighten it up. I think getting the product filled in our stores and better store conditions and more consistently for our customer is one thing. I think that private brands is another big leverage. And I think the work that Larry and the team are going to do yet that we're really at the beginning of that doing a better job on the category by category assortment that our merchants need and being priced right. I think those are the big levers inside our store to really keep driving the overall sales per square foot of our buildings. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. And the only thing I would add to that is we are -- especially on the Family Dollar side, we are under skewed and we are under skewed based on how we ship product to the stores. We tend to ship only in case packs versus eaches for the higher margin, slow-turn merchandise. If you look at our cooler commitment, we are under cooled for lack of a better phrase in our Family Dollar stores and probably our Dollar Tree stores. So there is lots of upside by managing the SKU base. \nOperator: We will take the next question from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: I was wondering if you could just help us give us a little more specific magnitude of the product cost inflation you're seeing on the consumables versus the discretionary side of both businesses? And just with -- as you work with suppliers, are you seeing any light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the product cost inflation front? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes, Kelly, maybe the best way to describe the support dimension to it is, if you take a look at our inventory, and you take a look at our inventory on a year-over-year basis. And in my prepared remarks, I had mentioned that part of the inventory increase was as a result of last year, the covers being fairly there last year as a result of customer pull forward in the holiday and then us chasing goods. But even if you step back from that, about 40% to 45% of our increase in inventory on a year-over-year basis is as a result of product -- vendor product cost increases. There's another roughly 20% that is as a result of higher freight costs associated with those inventories. \n So just those 2 components represented about roughly 60%, 65% of the increase in the cost of our inventory. And that's what is now embedded in our inventory and then, of course, we'll be rolling through with respect to margins on a go-forward basis, in which we have been dealing with over the course of the year. \n Yes. As it relates to -- our merchant teams continue to be, I think, very resourceful and looking at different suppliers, negotiations, working with them around allowances, working with them across other ways to get support on the business. And then, of course, one of the things that is really important to us, and Mike had mentioned is we're leaning into is private brands and the opportunity to blend that more into our offering. Our customers are looking for that opportunity, and it gives us more margin protection. \nOperator: We will take the next question from line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: It's Simeon Gutman. Following up on this freight question, I wanted to ask maybe a different way. So is part of it that the timing of contracts means that we don't see a lot of the savings in '23? Or are you just reserving the right to figure out how to plan the business? There will be savings, but you're not sure of how to reinvest or use the savings yet. \nJeffrey Davis: Yes, I think you're spot on. As it relates to the freight those contracts and the way that we would recognize it is more of a forward look. So it would be into a 2023 year. And then as that freight -- as we negotiate this new freight costs or see those freight costs coming down, it would run through our inventory turns. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. So I guess it's a '23 into '24 phenomenon where the real savings builds up, is that the right way to interpret that answer? \nMichael Witynski: We should see in the back half of the '23, we should start to see. It's about a quarter drag. We turn our inventories 4x a year. So it's usually about a quarter drag once we start appreciating the lower rates, then we can see that in our product as it's coming through. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then just my quick follow-up. On the traffic on Dollar Tree, can you talk about -- I'm sure this has been asked, but why like multiyear, I think it got a little better this quarter, but structurally, it's been down for the past several years. Can you talk about that? And then why shouldn't the right algo be you get price, but traffic is either flat or it could decline because it's hard to understand why the traffic has structurally been weaker over the last several years? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, I would just say this. I think it's a lot due to our assortment that we provided for our customer, and the majority of that was on the consumable side. And then just during the pandemic, our customer, it was -- we weren't high consumable-driven and high discretionary where they were -- when they had money in their pocket, trips were consolidated in '20 and '21, and they were buying high-ticket items to decorate their homes, decorate outside and replacing a lot of things inside their house. That's not what Dollar Tree is at our single fixed price point. \n So '20 and '21 were okay for us. But when we saw the consumable side of the business, that assortment go away, that was impacting our traffic. That's why I'm really excited about going forward. The last 2 quarters now, we're seeing that consumable sales come back 9.4% comp in the third quarter and we see that continuing, especially on the consumable. And then on the frozen side of the business, we do see that traffic starting to settle back into what Dollar Tree has been known for, that low single-digit traffic increases with ticket increase to have a nice go-forward balance between the two and continuing to balance our mix between consumables and discretionary. I think that's ahead of us and that's what the work that the team has been doing. In the last 2 quarters, we're seeing evidence of it. \nOperator: There are no further questions, so I will hand it back over to your host to conclude today's conference. Thank you. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Caroline, and thank you for joining us for today's call. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss both Q4 and fiscal year-end results is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, March 1, 2023. Thank you, and have a good day. \nOperator: With that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Witynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you have seen in recent months, we have announced a number of executives have joined Dollar Tree. I am excited about the caliber and quality of the leadership team we now have in place. This team will lead our company through the next evolution of growth. We are committed to transforming our culture, meeting our shoppers and associates' needs, improving store productivity and efficiencies and delivering improved long-term operating results.  \n I am pleased with the team's efforts to deliver solid results for the quarter. Our third quarter sales performance reflects the timely execution of merchandising initiatives to drive our consumables business in this uncertain and inflationary environment. Same-store sales for both segments improved from the prior quarter and delivered sequential monthly improvement throughout the quarter. Shoppers are responding to our new value proposition at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree as we focus on driving both traffic and store productivity.  \n With the exception of Q1 and Q2 of 2020 at the initial onset of the pandemic, our 6.5% enterprise comp represents our best quarter since the Family Dollar acquisition. By segment, the comp was comprised of an 8.6% increase for Dollar Tree and a 4.1% increase for Family Dollar. In recent quarters, we refined our strategies at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to focus on the traffic-driving consumables side of the business. Our transition to the $1.25 price point has enabled our merchants to greatly enhance value for our shoppers. For the second consecutive quarter, our consumables comp outpaced the discretionary comp at Dollar Tree. The team delivered a 9.3% comp on consumables with key contributors being in food and beverage, snack and cookies and candy.  \n Family Dollar consumables increased 4.7% on a comp basis. Despite the ticket headwinds related to our price actions in Q2, shoppers are clearly recognizing the greater value and are responding to our enhanced advertising initiatives. Importantly, at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we saw an acceleration in comp performance throughout the quarter, with October being our strongest month.  \n We have a number of key sales-driving initiatives to drive productivity. For Dollar Tree stores, we are continuing to exceed the customer's expectation for value, our merchants do a tremendous job of effectively managing the ever-changing assortment that wows our shoppers, expanding our $3 and $5 offering into more stores. We ended the quarter with our plus assortment in nearly 30% of our Dollar Tree stores, and we'll continue to aggressively expand this initiative in the years ahead. We are currently refining our $3 and $5 assortment as our team operates in an environment of continuous improvement based on learnings. We are developing our frozen assortment to meet our shoppers' family needs as they are looking to save money by dining at home. We are aggressively expanding our offerings of protein, pizza, breakfast items and family sizes at price points that meet their budgets.  \n We will continue to focus on winning the season. Dollar Tree is a destination for shoppers looking to celebrate holidays, events and seasons. Our offering will be better than last year but not as good as next year as we continue to improve our assortments. Family Dollar, from a pricing perspective, is in the best position in more than a decade. Now that we have taken action to reestablish price parity, we are committed to maintaining our competitiveness.\n  Other Family Dollar initiatives designed to improve sales per square foot, unit sales and transaction count include: improving our store layouts through improved adjacency flow, adding linear square footage, expanding immediate consumption DSD categories and optimizing the beverage and frozen food offering. Developing private brands, we are in the process of growing and improving our private brand performance by providing shoppers more choices and a broader offering of quality products at a greater value. Over time, we believe this will enhance customer loyalty as well as our margin profile.  \n We are refining our marketing effectiveness to provide customers with convenience, value, variety and an improved shopping experience. We have evolved our print advertising calendar and format to be more relevant to our customers to drive their visit frequency. We are also in the process of relaunching our Smart Coupon program, designed to improve quality, availability, clip rate and redemptions. \n In this changing and dynamic environment, we feel we are implementing the right plans to drive sales productivity, enhance margins and improve efficiencies to enhance the long-term benefits to each of our stakeholders. In October, Jeff Davis joined Dollar Tree as our new CFO. Jeff brings more than 30 years of financial leadership to the organization with much of his experience coming from large retailers, including Walmart, JCPenney and Darden. Jeff is very much focused on value creation through strategic growth and strategic decision support as well as value preservation through governance and efficiency in operations. Jeff has been the company for nearly 2 months, but he is making a difference already. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff to provide more color on Q3 and what's ahead of us. Thanks, Jeff. I am proud of our team's efforts. During a period of material organizational change, a disruptive hurricane through the Southeast and macro uncertainty contributing to the highest inflation in 40 years, we delivered increases of 8.1% in sales, 17.5% in gross profit, 22.8% in operating profit and an increase of 25% in EPS. Our results continue to reinforce the relevance of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to millions of households across North America.  \n As you know, in late June, we announced that a number of executive positions would be changed. I am proud to share that by mid-November, all seats are filled, and we are very confident in the outstanding team we have built. All additions have been successful leaders throughout their careers and bring new, fresh perspectives and will enhance our progress. In addition to the executive changes, last week, we announced new leaders for several key areas of the business, including diversity, sustainability, compliance and communications. I am very confident in the team we have developed and that it will enable us to accelerate progress on our transformational journey.  \n In the months ahead, we will be refining and prioritizing our plans to ultimately deliver improved operating performance across both segments. At our spring Investor Day, we will provide you with more transparent and comprehensive view into the opportunity ahead us and the path to get there.  \n Before we transition to Q&A, I want to sincerely share my gratitude to our associates, especially in Florida and the Carolinas for their efforts during Hurricane Ian at the end of September. Their efforts through the preparation for and the recovery from this devastating storm was critical to countless families and communities we serve. In many cases, our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores were among the first to reopen to assist customers with products they needed most. Thank you to each of you. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think it's a combination of everything that you're seeing going on, the pressure on the customer. And then our merchandising team invested the investment we made in getting our prices right to be at parity in the marketplace and then as well as writing more impactful ads and more frequency of our ads. So I think stronger promotion, stronger base pricing and then the work on the assortment in our [ H2.5 ], I think, is meeting the overall macro impact that the customer is seeing on the pressure that they have to try and meet the budget each and every day.  \n I think that on a customer, we're seeing -- we're seeing continued pressure. We're -- as I've shared, we're seeing more customers come into our segment. And once they're in our segment, these are -- the majority of the customers are at [ 80,000 ] and higher household income. But even once they're inside the store, we're seeing shifts in their behavior where they're very consumable and needs-based focused to try and make that budget work and stretch it over the month.  \n We're seeing private brands now for 39 weeks in a row have outpaced national brands, 39 weeks in a row. We have not seen that the prior 5 to 7 years where private brands were outpacing national brands, but it's now been 39 years in a row -- or 39 weeks in a row, I'm sorry. And then we're seeing first in a month business is getting stronger. We're seeing our SNAP and food stamp business is growing, and we continue to see credit as outpacing debit.  \n So we do see that shift in the customer coming into our segment, and then when they're in our store, they are shifting into the consumables and needs based to make their budget happen. And I think the work that our merchants are doing are absolutely aligned and helping drive meeting their needs when they're in our store. Yes. I'll start with $1.25. I think overall, our traffic has been very stable, and we saw a slight improvement in Q3 in traffic. But what was more important is throughout 2020 and 2021, our consumable sales continued to decline quarter after quarter because of the product availability and the assortment we just couldn't provide for the customer at that dollar price point. Once we move to the $1.25 throughout this year, our merchant teams have worked hard at bringing in that new assortment, and we have absolutely change that trend. And instead of declining business in consumables it's now accelerating and leading the growth and I believe over time, that will continue to drive traffic into our stores and Dollar Tree.  \n So what I'm really excited about is for the second quarter in a row, consumables have outpaced our discretionary business, and it was 9.3%, 9.4% comp sales, but discretionary is still doing well at over 8%. So we like the business and the reaction we're seeing from the customers based on us being able to have a better assortment at greater values on products they need. And I think as we continue to provide that, that will help stabilize our traffic in the long-term going forward.  \n On the $3 and $5, we're seeing great response from our customers, especially on the seasonal side of the product. And that's where we think we can continue to refine and grow that business. And then as well, you've also heard us on the frozen food part at the $1.25, with the cost pressures, it's even hard for us to get a great value assortment at $1.25. So we've moved to multi-price products in our frozen food set. It's easier to communicate to our customers and our associates because it's door by door. And our -- and that assortment, as I've shared, the customers are responding greatly.  \n And again, this is our frozen business for the last 18 months was in a decline because of the same pressures we were seeing on the consumables. And now we've completely reversed that where we have introduced the multi-price $3 and $5 items, customers are responding well, and we see strong growth in our sales there. So I think between the 2 of those things, the consumables side and then the frozen side, over time, we will continue to drive traffic doing.  \n And then on the discretionary side, proven by our continued growth and a 8% comp, the customers still see the value in our seasonal party, toys, crafting and that continues to be strong. So I like the trends we're seeing overall. Yes. And you're right. Right now, we're meeting the needs where the customer is taking us, and we are improving that assortment. And I'll speak to Family Dollar. Larry got and the merchants have done a wonderful job at really improving that assortment and that pricing for that customer where they need us. And it's all in that consumable and DSD-related product. And we've done that not only in our base pricing, but our promotion pricing and then also in the linear footage dedicated to it, our resets in our 2.5.  \n So you're right. I think our biggest goal to drive improvement on the Family Dollar side is to get more sales per square foot in our boxes. And the first thing is driving it with consumables and being right on that. But the team is also, at the same time, really working on discretionary to be right on seasonal and home to meet their needs, but really, it's the consumables driving that trade over more than our effort and the works that we're doing on the merchandising side.  \n And then on the Dollar Tree side, just as I've shared, I like what I've seen in the last 2 quarters where one is up 9.5%, the other one is 8%. That's a great balance. And I think, as we continue to provide that value on the consumables side, I think over time, we like when both are 50%-50%, 50%, say, discretionary and 50% consumables. And then as they grow over time, I think like Dollar Tree historically, has always grown low single-digit comps with a combination of traffic and units in the basket. And I think once we settle and cycle through that, providing that effort on the consumables side, we'll get back to that normal cadence that we've seen in the past. And I would just say, too, the other thing is, as Family Dollar continues to prove their execution and drive market share in these products in DSD and national brands and then even in our private brands, vendor rebates and allowances will follow that because we're executing better. And Larry's team is really working hard on trying to drive that. So it's really even the mix within the mix as consumables grow, there's levers that we can pull with allowances and rebates and then mix in the private brands as that consumer shifts to that should help with some of the margin pressure, too. I believe across the board. And Larry's team, we have staffed up. We've brought in additional experts in this area on the private brand for Family Dollar. On the OTC and health, over-the-counter drug and health is where we're going to be focused and leaning in first. And of course, on the paper side of it, we think there's opportunity and then just on the everyday food side. So those would be the 3 big areas. \n And I think Larry's team, we're organizing around it. We're looking at the brands and driving penetration by category comparing to the rest of the market. And we've partnered with a third-party broker to really help accelerate that. So those would be the 3 big areas, and it's a huge focus for Larry and his team. No. I think you stated it right. Well, the customer-facing side is where we're leveraging, but on the back side, we'll be leveraging all the opportunities we can as one organization. Yes. So I'll start with the breadth and depth of Family Dollar. Again, Larry and his team is going category by category, and he's already made changes in our new H2.5, but that will be a continuous improvement throughout this next year, as him and his team apply that discipline and strategy to each category, we will be bringing in more SKUs where it makes sense to help meet the needs of the customer and comparing it to the rest of the market. And where we've done that in the categories that he's done so far, we're seeing great results in it. And I think that's why we're excited about our 2.5. \n We're also using our linear space more. We're putting in more shelves inside the box and then we can go vertically higher in the gondolas, the [ rows ] of shelving that we have right now. And again, that allows us to bring in more assortment into the store and getting more sales per square foot. \n The cooler is absolutely an improvement. And every time we remodel a store, we want to bring in more coolers, both cool beverage and frozen beverage because that's where the customer is moving to. And it's a convenience item and it's meeting their needs. So there is room for continued expansion there. And Larry's and his team has even really look at a reset for the whole frozen food set, and where we've rolled that out going into this back half of the year. So that's going to be a continuous improvement side. \n And on the supply chain, I would say we're constantly looking at the enabling our supply chain, as Rick said, to try and drive efficiencies and making it easier for our stores. And we're seeing improvements right now on things that we're doing in our supply chain. So I think it's -- you'll see it now throughout the next 2 to 3 years on how do we continue to refine our supply chain as a key enabler to drive the efficiencies and make it easier for our stores to get the product in the stores more efficiently. Yes. Thank you for the question. If you think about our margins right now and as we think about it move forward, it's really driven by what the customer is really leading into and buying. So right now, we're seeing a little more rotation into our consumables versus our discretionary, but yet you're seeing good growth on both sides. We like the balance of that. \n We're doing a number of things to continue to provide value to the customer and maintain that margin rate as best we can, recognizing right now that we're still under some level of product cost pressures as well as from a freight component, but still being able to deliver, as you said, high mid-30s types of margin rates. \n As we move forward, we will continue to look to deliver value to the customer across both of those broad categories of discretionary and consumables. We believe that a number of things that we're doing with a multi-price point will allow us to lean into the discretionary even more and hopefully continue to balance out that end of the business also. So it's really a combination of the two. And it depends on how the customer is in their behaviors and their needs, and we are able to provide them across that broad continuum. Yes. Michael, it's a good question. It's one in which -- what would be a natural level to leverage in normal circumstances versus what we are doing, as we had mentioned earlier, a good focus, continued focus and commitment around elevating our store standards investing in not only store standards, but our wage rates for our stores. We're -- and the combination of the two, we have been making some material investments. But if you look over a period of time, we've been able to leverage our SG&A, if you will, on about a 2% to 3% comp. Yes. Once again, I don't want to give any guidance beyond 2022 other than what we've provided. The investments that we're making this year and technology and supply chain on top of our normal base is what's really driving the increase. And we believe it's the right thing to do as we set up for the right capabilities for us to accelerate our growth going forward. And the continued pressure on cost. Yes, I would say that... Yes, I would say... Rick opened up, let's to clean it up, fill it up and straighten it up. I think getting the product filled in our stores and better store conditions and more consistently for our customer is one thing. I think that private brands is another big leverage. And I think the work that Larry and the team are going to do yet that we're really at the beginning of that doing a better job on the category by category assortment that our merchants need and being priced right. I think those are the big levers inside our store to really keep driving the overall sales per square foot of our buildings. We should see in the back half of the '23, we should start to see. It's about a quarter drag. We turn our inventories 4x a year. So it's usually about a quarter drag once we start appreciating the lower rates, then we can see that in our product as it's coming through. Yes, I would just say this. I think it's a lot due to our assortment that we provided for our customer, and the majority of that was on the consumable side. And then just during the pandemic, our customer, it was -- we weren't high consumable-driven and high discretionary where they were -- when they had money in their pocket, trips were consolidated in '20 and '21, and they were buying high-ticket items to decorate their homes, decorate outside and replacing a lot of things inside their house. That's not what Dollar Tree is at our single fixed price point. \n So '20 and '21 were okay for us. But when we saw the consumable side of the business, that assortment go away, that was impacting our traffic. That's why I'm really excited about going forward. The last 2 quarters now, we're seeing that consumable sales come back 9.4% comp in the third quarter and we see that continuing, especially on the consumable. And then on the frozen side of the business, we do see that traffic starting to settle back into what Dollar Tree has been known for, that low single-digit traffic increases with ticket increase to have a nice go-forward balance between the two and continuing to balance our mix between consumables and discretionary. I think that's ahead of us and that's what the work that the team has been doing. In the last 2 quarters, we're seeing evidence of it."

            "name": "Richard Dreiling",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. And good morning, everyone. In my short time here, I have been incredibly impressed with the team's overall enthusiasm and willingness to accept and embrace much needed change. As I stated last quarter, we are making change happen to create long-term shareholder value and enable the next wave of profitable growth for Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.  \n The company is moving at a rapid pace. We have done a remarkable job of rebuilding our executive team and with retail thought leaders that are subject matter experts and eager to be part of this transformational journey that we have embarked on. In a short period of time, all of our C-suite positions have been filled as well as new leadership roles dedicated to a number of key areas, including diversity, sustainability, compliance and communication. Last quarter, we shared news of the material price investments made at Family Dollar. These actions got on price parity with key competitors and widen our spread to grocery and drug stores. Customers are recognizing this commitment to value, which contributed to a 4% comp sales increase and the segment's first quarterly traffic increase in 3 years.  \n The teams are focused on improving store standards. They are committed to clean them up, straighten them up and fill them up. Improving sales productivity is a vital component of the Family Dollar turnaround, and we are extremely focused on driving sales per square foot, unit sales growth and transaction count growth. We are a company with more than 16,200 stores. But the way I prefer to look at this is that we are really 2 growth companies with 8,100-plus stores each. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are unique businesses with 2 different go-to-market strategies. Having 2 distinct large segments provides us flexibility like none other in value retail and both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have extraordinary opportunity for growth and improvement over time.  \n We are prioritizing our areas of growth, and we are moving with urgency. The new management team is in-house. We've taken aggressive action on price. The advertising and marketing cadence has been enhanced. We are in the midst of a cultural transformation throughout the organization, designed to enhance our associate and customer experience. Store standards are improving. Years of sales productivity opportunities are ahead of us and work on supply chain and technology initiatives will enhance us to achieve our ultimate goals. I know many are eager to learn more about all of our plans, including the timing, the magnitude and the expected returns. These details will be shared at our spring Investor Day in a more structured format as our new leadership team has assembled more time together.  \n We are entirely committed on taking the right steps to transform this organization for the long-term. On behalf of our directors, I want to thank each of our associates for their commitment, dedication and effort, especially for their willingness to embrace much needed change. This is a journey that I am thrilled to be part of.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Mike. I'll lead with that if that's okay. Hey, what I would say is the things that -- how we go to market, how we face the customer between the 2 banners are totally different. One is basic consumable retailing, the Family Dollar side. One is consistent everyday low price, one price point. The leverage, the beauty of the combination is all of the backside things that the consumer doesn't experience, the accounting, the HR, the legal. And that's where all those synergies exist even on the supply chain, how we deliver to the stores, how we look at this [ model ]. So all of those synergies are still there. \n But what we're doing a much different -- what I would think not only different but better job is with how we're facing the consumer realizing that, one is more emotional driven and then again, one is more concerned with everyday excitement value. Michael, I'll turn it over to you on that. Go ahead, Mike. I'm sorry. Go ahead, brother, I'm sorry. Bye-bye. Go. Yes. And the only thing I would add to that is we are -- especially on the Family Dollar side, we are under skewed and we are under skewed based on how we ship product to the stores. We tend to ship only in case packs versus eaches for the higher margin, slow-turn merchandise. If you look at our cooler commitment, we are under cooled for lack of a better phrase in our Family Dollar stores and probably our Dollar Tree stores. So there is lots of upside by managing the SKU base."

            "name": "Jeffrey Davis",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I am delighted to join the Dollar Tree team at such a pivotal time. I've been in my seat for almost 8 weeks, and I have experienced tremendous energy and excitement across the entire organization as the team is an embracing change. While the company has been around for decades, I believe we are in the early phase of significantly improving our long-term operating performance. In October, I had an opportunity to meet several of you at store visits and I look forward to connecting with a larger group in the near future. More details to come.  \n Since Mike and Rick already covered our third quarter sales results, I will now move directly to the discussion of operating income. Unless otherwise stated, all third quarter comparisons are against the same period last year. To supplement my comments, we are introducing a quarterly presentation on our website at corporate.dollartree.com/investors, which outlines several key operating metrics. We hope you will find this additional information helpful to better understand our business. \n Operating income increased 22.8% to $381.3 million or 5.5% of total revenue, a 70 basis point improvement in operating income margin. This was led by a 240 basis point improvement in gross profit margin, partially offset by a 170 basis point increase in our SG&A expense rate.  \n Gross profit increased 17.5%. The Dollar Tree segment gross margin improved 520 basis points, primarily from higher initial mark-on related to the move to $1.25 price point, lower freight costs and sales leverage, partially offset by greater penetration of lower-margin consumable merchandise and product cost inflation.  \n Family Dollar's gross margin declined 100 basis points, largely due to a product mix shift and product cost inflation. We expect to see continued pressure across both segments related to the inflationary cost environment and merchandise mix as our consumable sales are expected to continue outpacing discretionary.  \n SG&A as a percentage of total revenue increased 170 basis points to 24.4%. The increase is principally related to elevated repairs and maintenance as part of our commitment to improve store standards, investments in store hourly wages and higher inflationary costs across a number of expense categories, including utilities.  \n Corporate support and other expenses increased 30 basis points to 1.4%, primarily from increased stock compensation expense, higher incentive comp and professional fees. From a bottom line basis, net income improved 23.1% to $266.9 million or $1.20 per diluted share in comparison to $0.96 per diluted share last year.  \n Moving to the balance sheet. My comments reflect balanced comparisons to the end of Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021. Combined cash and cash equivalents totaled $439 million compared to $701 million. The reduction in cash is largely attributed to the repurchase of approximately 2.86 million shares for $397.5 million in Q3 of this year. Inventory increased 31.1%, primarily from inflationary product and freight costs, expansion of $1.25 in multi-price plus inventory and store growth. Also recall last year, shoppers pulled forward purchases well ahead of the holiday season, concerned about product availability, while we were chasing trans-specific deliveries of discretionary products as our inventory levels dip well below normal operating levels. This year, shoppers purchasing behavior appears to be more closely timed to holiday dates.  \n Finally, unit counts are at similar levels to October 2019. Our inventory is fresh. We have limited-dated inventory well within manageable levels. Capital expenditures were [ $391.2 million ] in the third quarter versus $295.6 million last year. For fiscal 2022, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $1.2 billion.  \n As we look to Q4, we see the following affecting our business. We will anniversary a significant number of Dollar Tree stores, approximately 2,500 in December and 3,000 in January, the transition to the $1.25 price point a year ago. We previously experienced an outsized benefit to comps and margins associated to the transition. The economy continues to pressure middle and low household income customers, resulting in needs-based purchasing. We expect consumables to outperform discretionary, which negatively impacts gross margin. We are cycling advanced child tax credit payments which were distributed mid-month from July to December in 2021.  \n On a year-over-year basis, we are facing higher costs from suppliers related to this inflationary environment. While at Family Dollar, we do have the flexibility to adjust price. At Dollar Tree, where we are at a fixed price points, it takes us time to adjust quantities and pack sizes for cost changes, which can lead to near-term pressure to margins. We will continue to invest in store and DC standards and expect to have higher year-over-year expenses in repairs and maintenance. In addition to being right on price, we will be right on wage as it continues to be a competitive market for talent.  \n We are raising our sales outlook for the year. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $28.14 billion to $28.28 billion compared to our previous outlook range of $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit comp sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase at Dollar Tree stores and a low single-digit increase in Family Dollar. Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 2.8% as we are experiencing supply chain delays related to procuring equipment and fixtures for store openings.  \n For Q4, we estimate consolidated net sales will range from $7.54 billion to $7.68 billion based on a mid- to high single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. At the end of Q2, we expected fiscal 2022 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.40. Due to several factors, including, but not limited to, an acceleration of consumable product mix shift and elevated product cost pressure, we expect to be in the lower half of the previous outlook range.  \n Other considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following: we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million. Net interest expense is expected to be $30 million in Q4 and $127 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate up 24.3% for the fourth quarter and 23.7% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 222.3 million shares for Q4 and 224.2 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. As of October 29, we had $1.85 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.  \n I'll now turn the call back to Mike. Yes. This is Jeff. Absolutely, from a standpoint of, given the mix shift and some of the other cost pressures, margin is much more under pressure. But given the increase in revenue, the opportunity to leverage our SG&A is definitely there. Yes. As I look at this, there is definitely the opportunity as freight rates start to turn back around. That -- we are on contract. Most of our business we do is on contracted carriers versus spot rates. So there's going to be a little bit of a lag in that timeframe. And at this point, we're not giving any guidance for 2023 as of yet. But to the extent that we continue to see the freight rates and the other transpacific rates coming down and staying down, that will be reflected in our longer-term contract rates. \n We will then have the opportunity to balance that with giving back to the customer as well as the shareholder. But having said that -- that's only one component. The other component is underlying product cost. And right now, there is as much pressure and many times in the product cost, underlying vendor product costs as there is in freight. So we have to balance the 2. And definitely keep an eye on, in my mind, is how we create value for the overall organization is balancing that in being priced right in the marketplace for our customer as well as providing a higher return to our shareholders. Yes. So we're in the new quarter here, we're not going to give you intra-quarter guidance. And it's really early for us to tell. So I think that when we release our fourth quarter results, we'll be able to tell you a little bit more about that. Yes. We historically have not given guidance necessarily on a banner basis. We look at it in total, the pressure that we're seeing is, once again, the continued rotation in the consumables and how the customer is responding there as well as we know that we are continuing to see other inflationary cost pressures across the P&L. But all of this is more -- was anticipated back when we gave our earlier guidance, it's really the product mix shift that is the predominant sort of driver of our -- sort of direction around the lower half of the range. Yes, Kelly, maybe the best way to describe the support dimension to it is, if you take a look at our inventory, and you take a look at our inventory on a year-over-year basis. And in my prepared remarks, I had mentioned that part of the inventory increase was as a result of last year, the covers being fairly there last year as a result of customer pull forward in the holiday and then us chasing goods. But even if you step back from that, about 40% to 45% of our increase in inventory on a year-over-year basis is as a result of product -- vendor product cost increases. There's another roughly 20% that is as a result of higher freight costs associated with those inventories. \n So just those 2 components represented about roughly 60%, 65% of the increase in the cost of our inventory. And that's what is now embedded in our inventory and then, of course, we'll be rolling through with respect to margins on a go-forward basis, in which we have been dealing with over the course of the year. \n Yes. As it relates to -- our merchant teams continue to be, I think, very resourceful and looking at different suppliers, negotiations, working with them around allowances, working with them across other ways to get support on the business. And then, of course, one of the things that is really important to us, and Mike had mentioned is we're leaning into is private brands and the opportunity to blend that more into our offering. Our customers are looking for that opportunity, and it gives us more margin protection. Yes, I think you're spot on. As it relates to the freight those contracts and the way that we would recognize it is more of a forward look. So it would be into a 2023 year. And then as that freight -- as we negotiate this new freight costs or see those freight costs coming down, it would run through our inventory turns."

Today's call is being recorded.\n At this time, I'd like to hand the conference over to Randy Guiler, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss results for Dollar Tree's Second Fiscal Quarter 2022. With me on today's call are Executive Chairman, Rick Dreiling; President and CEO, Mike Witynski; and CFO, Kevin Wampler.\n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about our expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements.

We caution against reliance on these forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements, except as may be required by law.\n Following our prepared remarks, Mike and Kevin will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Mike and I and our new Board have been together for just over one quarter now. As planned and expected, change is underway, and we are moving at a fast pace. We are entirely focused on taking the right steps to transform this organization for the long term through growing and improving Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. We are 90 days further down the road from our last earnings call, and the opportunity and action steps needed continue to become more clear.\n Our main priorities are our associates, the distribution network and supply chain, Family Dollar's pricing and the value proposition in both segments, store standards and technology. Additionally, and Mike will go into more detail, we have a great deal of work underway to improve the company's culture, designed to build an environment of accountability, empowerment, courageous leadership, transparency and fostering two-way dialogue.\n And we are orchestrating these changes in one of the most unique and dynamic environments I've experienced in my retail career. Inflation is at its highest in decades as shoppers are experiencing higher costs related to food, fuel, rent and more. Supply chains have been strained and inconsistent. Inventory levels are higher across retail, and consumer shopping patterns continue to zig and zag.\n Let me be very clear. We are not here to take half measures or to defer high return capital and operating investments in order to manage earnings. We are honed in on taking steps necessary to seize the great opportunity for us and deliver to our shareholders, our associates and our customers the great company they deserve. And by executing on this commitment, we'll deliver the greatest possible risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. We'll not waver from this strategy.\n You will hear from Mike and Kevin later in the call about some of the actions we're taking to fix Family Dollar. As you know, our new leadership team is taking shape, and the team is moving to accelerate actions to improve the business. The most notable action is our decision to move forward with price investments that began in July and will carry into the second half intended to close our historical GAAP and pricing to key competitors.\n We believe this is a necessary action to provide the right value proposition and a foundational step to improve Family Dollar long term and that it will pay off handsomely. There is much more to do to enhance the results of Family Dollar, and you will hear about some positive improvements beginning to be made later in the call. That said, the refreshed team has been together for about a quarter, and we feel very confident in our ability to fix Family Dollar and materially improve its performance long term and in the process, create enormous value.\n We are a growth company. We are making change happen to create long-term shareholder value and enable the next waves of profitable growth for Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. On behalf of our Board, I want to thank each of our teams for their efforts on delivering very good results for the second quarter.\n I'll now turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are dialed in today from our Annual Field Leadership Summit. More than 1,000 leaders, including every district manager in the company, have gathered for several days to learn, collaborate and focus on all things Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. This is our first large in-person meeting since 2019. The energy and excitement here makes me and each of us more inspired than ever. We will transform our culture and company, and we will do this together.\n Rick just mentioned that we are moving at a fast pace. The theme of our leadership summit is, in fact, Lead with Speed. I want to publicly thank all of our participants for their commitment, dedication and focus while attending this great event. I'm proud to be part of your team.\n At these meetings, we typically talk about our company's strategy and share proof points of our collective successes. But this year is different. This year, I'm speaking to our leaders about something no less important than strategy. It's our company's culture. Every retailer has a playbook when it comes to strategy. But what sets the winning companies apart is their culture. Just as Rick mentioned, we are committed to developing a culture of accountability, empowerment, courageous leadership, transparency, and fostering two-way dialogue. We have recognized and acknowledged to ourselves that we have substantial opportunity for improvement in this respect. We have the courage to address this head on, and we would deliver the culture necessary to provide our associates, the customers and the shareholders the greatness they deserve.\n Also at this summit, our field leaders got their first look at the initial holiday buys purchase for the new $1.25 price point. We are all excited by the compelling and relevant assortment sourced by Rick McNeely's Dollar Tree merchant team and are very confident our shoppers will be wowed by these new items and the great values over the upcoming holiday season.\n We are undergoing a period of change, exciting change, and we have accomplished a great deal and what I'd call the first 100-plus days since our Board was reconstituted. A few months ago, we announced a number of leadership changes. We are actively engaged in recruiting leaders to the organization with the right perspectives, experiences and skill sets to help transform our company. The great opportunity before us has attracted the attention and interest of the strongest leaders in retail. In just a few months, we have already filled several key roles with exceptional talent, including Larry Gatta as Family Dollar's Chief Merchant, John Flanigan as our Head of Enterprise Supply Chain; and Bobby Aflatooni now leads our enterprise IT department.\n This morning, we announced that Jeff Davis will be joining Dollar Tree as our new CFO. Jeff has many years of experience as a retail CFO and spent nearly a decade in executive leadership roles with one of the largest retailers. And we have carefully reviewed a field of exceptional candidates for our COO and General Counsel executive roles. The teams are gelling, and the new leaders are hitting the ground running. I look forward to sharing upcoming announcements as we round out the executive team for the next waves of growth and transformation for Dollar Tree and the Family Dollar business.\n In light of the substantial leadership changes, I felt that we could deliver a more useful and productive event if we will defer our Investor Day from October until the spring of 2023. We will share more details on the event as it takes shape in the months ahead.\n Our second quarter performance reinforces the relevance of our brands for millions of households as they continue to face cost pressures across the board. The team delivered increases of 6.7% in sales, 14.2% in gross profit, 25.7% in operating profit and 30.1% in EPS while successfully navigating through another quarter of macro uncertainty.\n Now to Q2 performance by banner. I am pleased with the quarter delivered by Family Dollar team. The positive 2% comp represented an acceleration from Q1 on a 1-, 2- and 3-year stack basis. A 3.3% increase in average ticket more than offset a 1.2% decline in transaction count. Same-store sales were relatively balanced throughout the quarter as monthly comps range from a positive 1.5 to a positive 2.5.\n Despite supply chain challenges and OTC-related categories, the consumables comp increased 4% for the quarter. Discretionary comps declined 4.1% as shoppers continued to manage through this inflationary environment. Compared to the prior year's quarter, we saw 150 basis point swing in product mix from discretionary to consumables. In Q2, consumables represented 77.3% of Family Dollar sales compared to 75.8% in Q2 of 2021.\n The turnaround of Family Dollar is an enormous value creation lever, and it is getting a great deal of focus and attention. Components of the transformation include, as Rick mentioned, a focus on our people, the DC network and supply chain, pricing and the value proposition as well as our technology. Additional factors include enhancing our culture, elevating store standards, developing our private brands, improving category adjacencies, enhancing the product mix, optimizing vendor partnerships and much more. We are pushing forward on each one of these fronts.\n We are still early in this journey, but I am enthusiastic about the progress we have made just in the last few months. I want to call out, in particular, the important initiative we have taken on our pricing at Family Dollar. With the recent price investments, we believe Family Dollar is now in a better competitive position on price than it has been for over a decade. We will continue to refine the Family Dollar value proposition to drive store traffic and productivity, and we will fully expect to see great benefits from these and other actions over time.\n During the quarter for Family Dollar, we opened 95 new stores, renovated 257 stores and relocated 24 stores. We ended the quarter with more than 540 Combo Stores, which continue to resonate with the shoppers while driving more productivity and more profitability.\n Moving now to the Dollar Tree segment. The Dollar Tree banner delivered another strong quarter. Among the highlights, a 7.5% comp; a 37.4% gross margin, 500 basis points above the prior year's quarter; and a 15.4% operating margin, more than 500 basis points over Q2 of last year. The 7.5% comp sales increase was driven by a 14.2% increase in average ticket partially offset by a traffic decline of 5.8%.\n Importantly, the consumable business at Dollar Tree was strong. Consumables, which represented 46.8% of the mix in Q2, comped at 7.9%, while discretionary increased 6.7%. The last time the consumable comp exceeded discretionary was at the onset of the pandemic in Q1 of 2020. This demonstrates the success we are seeing in key traffic-driving categories where our merchants have been active in enhancing value, such as carbonated beverage, snacks and cookies and food. As a reminder, our reassortment consumables has been more immediate than the discretionary merchandise given the purchasing cycle, and our sales performance demonstrates that shoppers are reacting favorably to refine the value proposition.\n Renewed consumables momentum is a good indicator for our continued long-term health of the Dollar Tree banner. The discretionary side of the business was strong despite the negative impact of the limited global supply of helium, which hindered sales of balloon products and the party-related merchandise. Regarding cadence, similar to Family Dollar, comps were relatively balanced throughout the quarter with each month's comping increasing between 6.5% and 8.5%.\n During the quarter for Dollar Tree, we opened 32 new stores and relocated 5 stores, and we added multi-price assortment to another 697 stores, bringing the total to 2,170 stores as we head into the back half of 2022 and the important holiday season. I would like to speak to what we are seeing in the business as consumers continue to be burdened by levels of inflation not experienced in decades.\n Overall, sales performance remains in line with our expectations. And in fact, we have modestly increased expectations for Family Dollar for the back half. There are signs of trade down to our stores, and we are focused on the value proposition for both banners in this environment. Like many retailers, we are seeing a shift in consumable preferences as many shoppers are gravitating to needs-based consumables, which is impacting our margin through product mix.\n Our suppliers are being hit with -- by inflation as well. This, along with our commitments to competitive pricing and the value proposition, is expected to negatively impact our gross margins in the near term. Over time, we believe our business should be able to protect its merchandising margin from inflation effects. And regarding supply chains, from a sourcing perspective, a year ago, we had a backlog of thousands of containers we were working to get through the transpacific shipping lanes. This year, we have a small, manageable backlog.\n Kevin will go into more detail regarding our updated outlook for the back half of the year. Our outlook will be reduced with most of the guidance reduction related to the Family Dollar as we take action to improve that banner. Of the total, more than half of our guidance reduction is due to pricing actions taken at Family Dollar. The remainder is due to mix shift differences and inflationary cost increases on consumables at both banners. None of this dampens my enthusiasm for our long-term prospects.\n I'll now hand the call over to Kevin to provide more color on Q2 and our updated outlook. \nKevin Wampler: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 6.7% to $6.77 billion, comprised of $3.57 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.19 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.9%. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 7.5%, and Family Dollar same-store sales increased 2%. At both banners, the increase in average ticket more than offset the decline in transaction count as shoppers continue to consolidate trips as gas prices are significantly higher than a year ago. Gross profit improved 14.2% to $2.12 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 31.4% compared to 29.4% in the prior year's quarter.\n Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 500 basis points to 37.4% compared to 32.4% for the same period last year as a result of the net of the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 455 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise. Occupancy costs decreased 50 basis points from leverage on the comp sales increase. Distribution costs decreased 20 basis points from leverage and higher capitalized amounts due to increases in inventory levels partially offset by higher hourly wages and higher DC maintenance and compliance costs. And shrink increased 20 basis points primarily from more favorable results in relation to accruals in the prior year quarter.\n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased 140 basis points to 24.7% compared to 26.1% for the same period last year. The factors include markdown costs increased 80 basis points due to higher promotional and price action markdowns. Shrink increased 45 basis points primarily from more favorable results in relation to accruals in the prior year quarter. And merchandise costs, including freight, increased 15 basis points, primarily due to higher freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise, partially offset by higher initial mark-on.\n Similar to Q1, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 100 basis points. The SG&A rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 23% in Q2 last year with Dollar Tree favorable to prior year, more than offset by Family Dollar and slightly higher corporate costs. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment improved 30 basis points to 22% when compared to the prior year's quarter.\n Payroll costs improved 90 basis points from leverage on the 7.5% comp and favorable development of workers' comp claims, partially offset by the annualization of minimum wage increases and investments in store payroll; other SG&A, which increased approximately 40 basis points, resulting from unfavorable development of general liability insurance claims; and inflationary pressure across several expense categories. Facilities costs increased 10 basis points primarily from higher utility and repairs and maintenance as we focus on improving store conditions. For the Family Dollar segment, the second quarter SG&A rate increased 200 basis points to 23% compared to 21% in the prior year's quarter.\n Payroll expenses increased 70 basis points, primarily due to hourly wages and investment in store payroll and an increase in workers' compensation expense due to favorable accrual adjustments in the prior year, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. Store facility costs increased 50 basis points, primarily from higher utility costs and an increase in repairs and maintenance expense as we focus on improved store conditions for our customers and associates. Other SG&A expenses increased 45 basis points due to higher legal fees, debit and credit card transaction fees, store supply expense and inflationary pressure across several expense categories.\n Depreciation and amortization increased 30 basis points related to elevated capital expenditures for store renovations and improvements. Corporate support and other expense as a percentage of total revenue was 1.5% compared to the prior year quarter of 1.3%. The higher costs primarily consist of increased stock compensation costs.\n Operating income improved 25.7% to $505.4 million or 7.5% of total revenue in the second quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to a year ago. Nonoperating expenses totaled $30.7 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense. The effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 23.5% in the prior year's quarter, resulting from higher state tax rates and lower work opportunity tax credits as a percentage of pretax income in the current year's quarter.\n Net income for the quarter improved 27.4% to $359.9 million or $1.60 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $282.4 million or $1.23 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.\n Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $689 million compared to $985 million at the end of fiscal 2021. Outstanding debt as of July 30 was $3.45 billion. The company repurchased approximately 1.66 million shares at an average price of $141.67 in Q2 or $235.8 million under the share repurchase authorization.\n Compared to last year, inventory levels at Dollar Tree are up 59.7% in dollars due to increased capitalized freight and distribution costs, additional multi-price Plus inventory and a significant increase in import inventory in transit compared to the prior year. Total units per store are up approximately 20% to prepandemic Q2 2019 levels but are expected to normalize as we go through the back half of the year. The inventory is fresh and basic in nature and does not represent a significant markdown risk.\n Inventory levels at Family Dollar increased 35.7% compared to Q2 last year due to increased capitalized freight and distribution costs and an increase in the average unit cost. Total units per store are below prepandemic Q2 2019 levels. Capital expenditures were $276.2 million in the second quarter versus $229.1 million in Q2 of last year. For fiscal 2022, we currently expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.4 billion.\n Depreciation and amortization totaled $193.5 million for Q2 compared to $176.1 million in the second quarter of last year. For fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million.\n As we look to the back half of 2022, we see the following affecting our business. As Mike mentioned, we are accelerating price investments in our Family Dollar business. These investments are designed to improve the value proposition for our shoppers and to drive traffic and store productivity. This investment has a near-term impact on profit, but we expect it to accrue long-term benefit. We have seen consumer purchasing shift based on economic conditions to a more consumable-based basket at both banners, which will negatively impact our expected mix and product margin.\n Dollar Tree's sales continue to be negatively affected by the global helium shortage. This directly affects balloon sales, but also has a halo effect on the entire party department. In general, stores with helium are comping positive in the party category, while those without helium are running negative comps. The delta is a 10%-plus comp differential in one of our largest high-margin discretionary categories.\n Our over-the-counter categories are being negatively affected by our supply chain challenges. This is creating a higher level of out of stocks in this category. We plan to continue to increase our investment in payroll in our stores in the back half. The labor market remains dynamic, and we are proactively addressing select markets to attract and retain associates. We are making investments in our stores and distribution centers through repairs and maintenance as well as compliance programs to ensure a great shopping and working environment.\n Based on these factors, diluted earnings per share for the full year is now expected to range from $7.10 to $7.40. This represents a $0.75 per share adjustment to the prior outlook based on the midpoint and is comprised of the following components. Roughly 60% of the change relates to the price investments at Family Dollar. An estimated 20% of the change relates to the margin impact of the mix shift towards needs-based consumables, projected to be a 300 basis point shift at Family Dollar and a 150 basis point shift at Dollar Tree in the back half. Again, the majority of this impact is expected to be on the Family Dollar side of the business.\n We are experiencing some degree of inflationary-related product cost increases, especially in lower-margin consumables, primarily at Dollar Tree, contributing to approximately 15% of the guide adjustment. As we have for decades, we have the ability to alter or reassort product based on cost changes, but this can take a few quarters, hence the near-term profit impact. And a small component of the guide adjustment relates to other items, including our commitment to improve store conditions.\n As a result of the aforementioned factors, most notably our accelerated price investment, we are expecting Family Dollar to be approximately breakeven from a segment operating margin perspective in the second half, down from its first half margin of approximately 2%. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion with slightly higher comps offset by slightly reduced square footage growth relative to prior guidance. We expect to deliver a mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a positive increase in the Family Dollar segment.\n Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 3.5%, down slightly from prior guidance due to the supply chain delays related to procuring equipment and fixtures for store openings. For Q3, we estimate consolidated net sales will range from $6.75 billion to $6.87 billion based on a mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.20 per share.\n Other considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $31 million in Q3 and $125 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.6% for the third quarter and 23.8% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 224.8 million shares for Q3 and 225.4 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. As of July 30, we had $2.25 billion remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.\n And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thanks, Kevin. As we continue to navigate through this dynamic and somewhat uncertain environment, we are excited about the continued progress at Dollar Tree and the material positive changes beginning to be made at Family Dollar. At Dollar Tree, as it relates to our multi-price offering, the team is continuing to refine the $3 and $5 assortment and testing various concepts to enhance the program and build on the very positive long-term impact from our multi-price offering.\n For example, test of multi-price frozen foods are driving exceptional sales productivity as the new offering is delivering tremendous value and meeting family portion needs such as frozen meals, pizza and ice cream. At Family Dollar, our Combo Store initiative continues to drive improved store performance at very attractive levels, in line with previous commentary. In fact, we are now exploring various sizes and formats in other markets beyond our rural target locations, pursued in our first iteration of the concept.\n Some of the initiatives to improve the business will take more time to produce an impact, notably in the supply chain and technology. That said, at Family Dollar, the work being done by Larry Gatta's merchandising and marketing teams has been remarkable and is beginning to be actioned upon more urgently. In fact, we have made a number of enhancements to our H2 strategic store format. We refer to the new version as H2.5. Among the changes made to improve store productivity, customer satisfaction and to better support our store associates through efficiencies include: adding a linear footage, developing seasonal assortments as a focal point, utilizing deeper shelving on key consumable categories to enhance store efficiencies and improve in-stocks, expanding the direct-to-store delivery offering, enhancing space dedicated to snacks and increasing the beverage offering and optimizing the frozen food assortments.\n At our Leadership Summit, the merchandising team shared the field leaders a wide array of consumables and discretionary merchandising initiatives to drive traffic and sales at Family Dollar. Our marketing teams are currently focused on 4 key initiatives: refreshing Family Dollar's brand positioning, evolving to a more productive ad program, relaunching our Smart Coupon program and expanding our Boys & Girls Clubs of America partnership to be a good partner in the communities that we serve.\n We believe that these key initiatives are beginning to have an impact, and consumers are increasingly looking to our stores to meet their needs. We believe the time is right to accelerate actions to better serve customers by providing an exceptional value proposition. We will go into more details on these initiatives and broader plans to transform Family Dollar and continue delivering great success at Dollar Tree in the quarters ahead and at our Investor Day in the spring of 2023.\n And I want to briefly share a few initiatives that Bobby Aflatooni's IT team are focused on to provide better support for our stores. These include: improving DC and store in-stock service levels through refinement of our demand forecasting, allocation and replenishment systems for both banners; improving customer satisfaction and driving through enhanced ability to support more complex promotional offers, such as buy a product A and get a discount on the product B; supporting field leadership and store efficiencies with improved labor systems; and enhancing our enterprise-wide data integration platforms.\n Before we go into Q&A, as I had previously announced, Kevin will be transitioning out of his role as Dollar Tree's CFO. Kevin has been instrumental in the company's growth and success since joining the organization in 2008. During Kevin's tenure, Dollar Tree has grown from 3,600 stores to more than 16,200 stores, from annual sales of $4.6 billion to more than $26 billion and from annual operating profits of $365 million to more than $1.8 billion. When Kevin joined Dollar Tree in December 2008, shares were trading at a split adjusted price of just $13 or $14 per share. I would like to publicly thank Kevin for his commitment, stewardship and significant contributions to Dollar Tree and its stakeholders over the last 14 years.\n Operator, we are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Rick, I'm curious, since you joined the company 90 days ago, what have been the biggest surprises for you, both positive and negative? And when you talk about steps to improve the store standards at Family Dollar and the DC network across both banners, can you elaborate a little bit more for us? And do you see any offsets in the P&L to help fund those actions? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, I'll start here and then turn it over to Michael. The positive, I have to tell you, the enthusiasm within the organization, and its willingness to embrace change. The interesting thing has been, there's not a lot of things we're talking about that people, Chuck, aren't shaking their head, yes, let's go get it done. So that, to me, is the foundation of this. And the company has made a major commitment to culture enhancement. In fact, we spent our near whole day just talking about how to manage people and how people need to be managed. And we spent a whole day just listening to people to hear what they're dealing with.\n Probably on the negative side, the pricing gap was a little bit larger than we thought. And we also believe this is a great time for customer trial, and we want to be right on our pricing. In terms of the supply chain side, we're looking at everything in the supply chain. We are assembling, I think Mike would agree, probably one of the best supply chain teams in the country. We have a lot of distribution centers that need to be updated and modernized. So we're feeling really good on how we're approaching that.\n The IT side, information technology, I might classify as a little bit bigger surprise in that there's a lot of basic things that the operators and the merchants need and the supply chain needs. So with that, Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything? \nMichael Witynski: No, I think Rick said it right. On the store side, I think the biggest thing is, is we're focusing the entire organization from a culture perspective on doing everything that we can do to make our store associates successful and enabling them to run better, cleaner, fuller stores. And we've -- I said -- I shared in my opening that we're here right now from our summit with -- every district manager in the country is here, and we are all aligned behind driving better store conditions.\n And that's going to entail in your question is, yes, we're going to continue to invest, and as Kevin said, into our property management and in everything we need to, to make sure our store conditions are the way -- to our standards for our customers, and we're committed to do that. And more importantly, our associates are enthusiastic, not only about the culture of supporting them and putting them at the center of everything that we do. But then they see the proof points of we're investing in pricing, we're improving our logistics. Larry is improving the merchandising, and they're seeing better assortment, more linear footage where the customers shop.\n And then I think Rick nailed it on the supply chain. We're doing everything we can and turning all the leaves over to drive efficiencies and improvements and really ultimately to supply our stores more efficiently with the product they need and when they need it. \nOperator: And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: I want to drill into pricing and investments at FD here, right? So how do you think the maturity of the price investments will play out, right? Immediately, it's deflationary, right, to comp until people recognize the benefit then traffic picks up. How does that play out? Is it more challenging in an inflationary environment to change your price perception? And then do you think most of the investments at FDO will be limited to '22, right? Or do you think there's a bunch that -- other than just a wraparound, a bunch that will occur in '23 as well? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Thanks for the question. And like I said earlier, the time is right, right now. And the reason we really looked at it is because we saw new customers shifting our way. In this inflationary environment, we think it's a perfect time to really change the customer's perception and what they're seeing in our stores because we're getting new customers and new eyes in our stores and our existing customers. They're feeling pressured like they never have before.\n And in this inflationary environment, with the customer's wallet stretched, our consumers are relying on our stores to meet their budget goals. And we're seeing good demand trends. So this was really an ideal environment to begin to move more quickly than we previously anticipated to more fully meet the customers' value expectation, close the pricing gaps and win them as customers long term in this inflationary budget. We think the time was right. We -- initially, we talked about it in our outlook, and we were going to do this over time, starting with, of course, our KVIs, the known value items. But then just as we saw the dynamic environment, the pressure on our customers and the inflation, we decided that now is the time to win these customers for the long term and get it right.\n And to your question, it's now. It's -- we are -- like I said, we are in the best price position in over 10 years to the competitive market. So we're there. Now it's just managing it from here. And getting right on our promotions. And Larry is going to continue rocking the H2.5 in the assortment. So we're in a great place right now. \nOperator: And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question with Matt Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So at the Dollar Tree banner, what was the cadence of top line trends during the second quarter? Any color on August or just drivers of confidence in holding high single-digit performance in the back half? And then on Dollar Tree banner gross margin, could you just touch on any puts and takes in the back half of the year to consider and how you're thinking about multiyear gross margin at the Dollar Tree banner? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Thanks for the question. And as I shared, it was pretty stable throughout the summer at Dollar Tree on our comp, 6.5% to 8.5%. And remember that -- and Dollar Tree really does well around the seasons. And in the second quarter, the biggest season is graduation. And you heard Kevin say we were really impacted by helium supply in one of our largest categories. That really has a halo effect over party. So largest category, most profitability for Dollar Tree. So that was one of the impacts.\n On the good news, the other big season is lawn and garden, and lawn and garden season was one of the top 5 categories. So when we had the product, our customer is responding very, very well. And then the other categories that did well is, as Kevin said and I said, the shift to consumables, and our merchants reassorted and reinvested in the consumable items to drive traffic. The other top 5 categories, again, were beverages, candy, snacks and cookies and food.\n So our customers are responding very, very well. And early in -- it's really early into Q3, but we see so far this month trending better than Q2 at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar both. And as you think about the margins in the back, where we're at -- as Kevin shared, our inventory is up. But remember, this time last year, we had thousands of containers at origin, meaning it wasn't even at our system. It wasn't even at the origin yet.\n So now all that is in our system. We're getting our seasonal on time. And it's also -- remember, our merchants at Dollar Tree bought for the back half at the $1.25. The product is amazing. All of our district managers, regional directors, all of our field associates are here with us right now. And they see the exciting items, and they're thrilled. A, we've got the product when we want it; and B, newly assorted $1.25 will blow the market away, and our customers are going to respond well. And we're very excited about it. Kevin can kind of touch on some of the margin puts and takes in the back half. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. As you look at it, Matt, obviously, as we talked this year, freight, which was a big headwind last year, and to the first half of this year, we said it would still be a headwind as we annualized last year rates, and we've said that into the back half, then it starts to level out. We still see that. Obviously, with -- if diesel continues to move down, that will be helpful as well. But again, I think as you look at the Dollar Tree gross margin rate, I think Q3 will be a little lower than Q2, but then you'll see it pop back a little bit in Q4, which is highly discretionary quarter for us. So that's kind of the trend you'll see.\n As I think about the multiyear gross margin, as you think about it, again, looking to build traffic, looking to -- as we build the -- again, really changing the stores. We now have 2,000 Dollar Tree Plus stores as we look at, again, continuing to further the assortment of the $1.25 price point. And then would look to see that the freight rates do start to come down and have an effect in next year. So there are some things that will play into that. A little early to really talk specifically. But I think those are kind of the moving pieces as we see them. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and move on to the next question from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: I was hoping we could get a little more color. I think you mentioned trade down. And maybe some more discussion about the environment. The transactions were up at Walmart, Target and warehouse clubs. And I was just curious why the transactions are so much stronger versus being down at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree and if we should expect some improvement in the transactions. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. We expect improvement in our transactions, especially as -- the pricing moves that we've made, the assortment changes that Larry Gatta and the merchants are making and bringing in some new adjacencies and our seasonal product that we have ready. Just a little pressure -- as you said, our customer is pressured like none other. And the good news is, is we're excited. We see third-party data that we do have a lot of new customers coming into both banners over last year. And the majority of them are at a household income of $80,000 or higher. So we feel good about that. We also see a huge shift from cash into credit, which tells us the customer is pressured.\n And then inside the store, when they get in there, we've seen in the industry where private brands have outpaced national brands for 24 weeks in a row now, 24 weeks in a row. That hasn't happened in the last 5 years, that private brands has outpaced national brands. And that's the customer trying to stretch their dollar and manage their budget. And Larry and the team are working hard on our private brands, and we're seeing the same change inside of our store.\n And then they're even making decisions on form and function. We see them moving from liquid to powder detergent. We're seeing them even go without softener -- liquid softener in detergents. They're just choosing not to have softener. And those are the things that our customers are -- and the decisions they're making. And we think right now, with the price investments and the changes that Larry is making and our new assortment at Dollar Tree, we're in a wonderful position to meet their needs in 16,000 stores conveniently located where they don't have to drive far. We'll meet their needs, and we're excited about it going forward. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. \nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli. So I wanted to revisit the question that I actually asked last quarter. So we know that, in general, retail turnarounds take longer, costs more than what people generally expect. And last quarter, when I asked about that, your comment was that for the investments for '22, it was all embedded in your outlook. So given the change this morning and the fact that you've now had more time to evaluate the improvements that need to be made, do you have a better view of how much more investment may be needed to get Dollar Tree and Family Dollar where you want them from an operational and technological standpoint? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. And Bobby is -- that's a great question. And our team is forming right now. And I think from an OpEx perspective, we're going to continue to invest in labor where we need to. And there will be payroll investments going forward. For this year, as far as we can see with the dynamic markets going on, it is embedded in our forecast.\n From the IT and supply chain, I think those are the 2 big ones. And what Bobby is looking at right now, the good news is, and I think Rick mentioned it, Bobby knows every one of our systems. And he knows exactly what he needs to do because he's done this before at other retailers, and he's worked with the 2 executives in supply chain and merchandising.\n So Bobby is working really hard. And I will owe you that number probably up in the spring when we have our Investor Day because that is going to be a longer-term outlook, and the majority of it is going to be in CapEx.\n And then the same thing with supply chain. We're looking at what is the best way to deliver to our stores, what's the most efficient way to use our network to deliver our Combo Stores, our Dollar Tree Plus stores and, of course, our traditional Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores.\n And John is working on that now and modeling it out, and we'll probably have more information on the spring as the -- as we have more knowledge from the 2 leaders. Our CFO that we just announced is going to be coming on board and will certainly have a say in it and will want to look at it.\n But those are the 2 big investments. But in our OpEx and in our forecast, from a repair and maintenance and store conditions perspective, we have those embedded in, and we will probably come back to you if there's any other longer-term initiatives that will impact that. \nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: It's Simeon Gutman. For Mike and Rick, this is maybe more theoretical on timing and sequencing. It looks like '23 may end up being more transitional, and that's part one of the question. Is that fair? Because some of these price investments will continue and then we're going to lap some of the multi -- or the breaking the buck at the tree. So if that's a fair assumption, how do you think about maybe speeding up investments, layering -- leaning in, I guess, for '23 to clear the path for '24? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. And in theory, I think you're right. But our pricing investment is in, and then we're just going to manage that going forward on that side of it. I think we will lean in on our investments on supply chain and IT, but these are things that take time just because of the amount of systems that you are touching. And as Rick said, it's our -- as our store and retail systems, as our supply chain systems and then our merchandising systems. So that will take time, and we will stage that over our capability.\n And then the supply chain will be -- as we roll out and open new distribution centers, that's when we will continue to rightsize our network and make decisions going forward. So we will continue to move with speed that will give us the highest return as quick as possible. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: It looks like the elasticity response improved again sequentially with the $1.25 change. Just wondered what your expectation for the response is for the second half and if that's changed meaningfully from what you were thinking when we last spoke to last quarter. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. No, I think the biggest change is the dynamic of the marketplace and the huge shift from discretionary to consumables, not the shift about our $1.25. We did some in-depth customer research and customer intercepts about Dollar Tree at the beginning of the quarter. And we really wanted to dig into our brand and the assortment and in-store experience. And I was shocked. Not one of them brought up price. Not one of them brought up the $1.25.\n They were all focused on clean, new assortments, seasonal and the service of the -- what they have when they're in the stores. So I think the customers move beyond that because as we tested early on, they understand value more than ever. And in today's dynamics, they see that $1.25 is an exceptional value. That's why all these new items and consumables are all taking off.\n And why I'm excited about the back half -- and to your point, the second quarter did not really have any big season. Dollar Tree is all about the seasons. We change like the leaves on the trees. Well, in the summer, the leaves aren't changing because you've got lawn and garden and then you've got graduation, and graduation was impacted by helium. On the back half, Kevin said we've got 2,000 -- 2,100 actually, Dollar Tree Pluses that we didn't have. So that's going to be -- that's exciting about the back half.\n And then our inventory. We've got all of our seasonal inventory at $1.25. And they will rally around this seasonal merchandise, just like they did in the first quarter with Valentine's and Easter. We expect some exciting things and great response from our customers because we're in a great inventory position. The value is spectacular. And then on the basic side, we've answered that on the consumables that we didn't have last year at this time. So I'm pretty excited about the back half of Dollar Tree. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. \nScott Mushkin: So I just wanted to get into a little bit more about labor, some of the comments you said about labor and the labor competition and what kind of pressure that might put on you as you try to get that more where you want it to be. \nMichael Witynski: Yes, Scott, and thanks. Early on, we shared that we're investing over $195 million, just under $200 million in our payroll, the majority of it in our store associates and some of it in our DCs. We feel really good where we're at in our distribution centers. We've got all of our roles filled compared to this time last year where we didn't have open positions. We are continuing to invest in markets in the stores and at retail stores, and we will continue to do that where we see the need.\n Looking out over the back half of the year, where we need to make adjustments is already in our forecast. So it's a dynamic environment. Now people are coming back to work a little bit just because of what's going on in the economy. So I think that's going to shift a little bit, but we will continue to invest where we need to. And so far, in the next 6 months, looking for the rest of the year, we have what we need to invest in the forecast. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: Just wanted to dig into a little bit further, if I could, the top kind of 2 to 3 drivers of traffic for both banners moving forward and kind of what the realistic time line to anticipate the shift. Obviously, there's pricing actions you're doing at Family Dollar, but then prices have gone up at Dollar Tree. So just kind of talk about, if you could there, Rick and Mike, what gives you the confidence and what's the time line to get those things turned up? \nKevin Wampler: Well, go ahead. \nMichael Witynski: Yes, I was just going to say, I just got done saying the excitement on the Dollar Tree side. Our assortment and the investments we've made into the new $1.25 on the consumable side is driving traffic. And just to put that in perspective, we haven't seen that kind of improvement in consumables, which drives traffic since pre pandemic. So that's our investment, and that's how we're driving traffic, along with the unbelievable assortment coming up that they're going to see inside our store for the seasons coming up. Unlike anybody else, Dollar Tree -- the $1.25 is the best value, the best wow and the most excitement.\n And then on the Family Dollar side, this pricing, again, we just put ourselves in a position to be the best price to the market in over 10 years. That alone will drive traffic, not even mentioning what Larry Gatta and the merchants are doing with enhancing our H2.5 with a tighter assortment, more meaningful prices, take advantage of more linear foot, so getting more product on the shelf that the customer is looking for. And then getting seasonal upfront and center. So I'm really excited about the moves that we've made.\n Now as you know, it takes time for the customer -- we've got new customers coming in that are recognizing it. And then over time, we will see and get credit for being priced right, better assortment, better position on the Family Dollar side.\n And Larry's -- and I mentioned purposefully on marketing, we've got 4 great marketing perspectives going on with our digital marketing, with our print ad, and Larry is really working on exactly what do we need to advertise that the customer responds to that drives traffic. So those are all the levers that the merchants and Larry are pulling on the Family Dollar side, and I'm just thrilled about what we got going on, on the Dollar Tree side to keep growing. \nOperator: And our last question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So Rick, you've been around the value retail space for a long time. Presumably, you came in and over the last 90 days, you said, look, we need to get Family Dollar price perception at a better spot in order to realize the full potential of this asset over the long run and we have this opportunity because Dollar Tree gross margins are expanding, and we can use that expansion to fund investments at Family Dollar. So now the question is, with Dollar Tree exiting this year at a 37% to 38% gross margin rate and Family Dollar exiting this year with a low 20s gross margin rate, can Dollar Tree sustain the 37% to 38% gross margin rate over the long run? And can you rebuild Family Dollar's gross margin rate over the long run in order to generate a suitable return on these investments? \nRichard Dreiling: I think the answer to that is we're very comfortable with where we are on the gross margin in Dollar Tree for the back half of the year and going forward. And I will say we are working our way with the vendor community, with vendor support, and we anticipate that the Family Dollar margin will improve over time. \nOperator: And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand it back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. \nRandy Guiler: Great. Thank you, Ali. Thank you for joining us for today's call. Our next earnings call for Q3 is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, November 22. Thank you, and have a good day. \nOperator: With that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Witynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are dialed in today from our Annual Field Leadership Summit. More than 1,000 leaders, including every district manager in the company, have gathered for several days to learn, collaborate and focus on all things Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. This is our first large in-person meeting since 2019. The energy and excitement here makes me and each of us more inspired than ever. We will transform our culture and company, and we will do this together.\n Rick just mentioned that we are moving at a fast pace. The theme of our leadership summit is, in fact, Lead with Speed. I want to publicly thank all of our participants for their commitment, dedication and focus while attending this great event. I'm proud to be part of your team.\n At these meetings, we typically talk about our company's strategy and share proof points of our collective successes. But this year is different. This year, I'm speaking to our leaders about something no less important than strategy. It's our company's culture. Every retailer has a playbook when it comes to strategy. But what sets the winning companies apart is their culture. Just as Rick mentioned, we are committed to developing a culture of accountability, empowerment, courageous leadership, transparency, and fostering two-way dialogue. We have recognized and acknowledged to ourselves that we have substantial opportunity for improvement in this respect. We have the courage to address this head on, and we would deliver the culture necessary to provide our associates, the customers and the shareholders the greatness they deserve.\n Also at this summit, our field leaders got their first look at the initial holiday buys purchase for the new $1.25 price point. We are all excited by the compelling and relevant assortment sourced by Rick McNeely's Dollar Tree merchant team and are very confident our shoppers will be wowed by these new items and the great values over the upcoming holiday season.\n We are undergoing a period of change, exciting change, and we have accomplished a great deal and what I'd call the first 100-plus days since our Board was reconstituted. A few months ago, we announced a number of leadership changes. We are actively engaged in recruiting leaders to the organization with the right perspectives, experiences and skill sets to help transform our company. The great opportunity before us has attracted the attention and interest of the strongest leaders in retail. In just a few months, we have already filled several key roles with exceptional talent, including Larry Gatta as Family Dollar's Chief Merchant, John Flanigan as our Head of Enterprise Supply Chain; and Bobby Aflatooni now leads our enterprise IT department.\n This morning, we announced that Jeff Davis will be joining Dollar Tree as our new CFO. Jeff has many years of experience as a retail CFO and spent nearly a decade in executive leadership roles with one of the largest retailers. And we have carefully reviewed a field of exceptional candidates for our COO and General Counsel executive roles. The teams are gelling, and the new leaders are hitting the ground running. I look forward to sharing upcoming announcements as we round out the executive team for the next waves of growth and transformation for Dollar Tree and the Family Dollar business.\n In light of the substantial leadership changes, I felt that we could deliver a more useful and productive event if we will defer our Investor Day from October until the spring of 2023. We will share more details on the event as it takes shape in the months ahead.\n Our second quarter performance reinforces the relevance of our brands for millions of households as they continue to face cost pressures across the board. The team delivered increases of 6.7% in sales, 14.2% in gross profit, 25.7% in operating profit and 30.1% in EPS while successfully navigating through another quarter of macro uncertainty.\n Now to Q2 performance by banner. I am pleased with the quarter delivered by Family Dollar team. The positive 2% comp represented an acceleration from Q1 on a 1-, 2- and 3-year stack basis. A 3.3% increase in average ticket more than offset a 1.2% decline in transaction count. Same-store sales were relatively balanced throughout the quarter as monthly comps range from a positive 1.5 to a positive 2.5.\n Despite supply chain challenges and OTC-related categories, the consumables comp increased 4% for the quarter. Discretionary comps declined 4.1% as shoppers continued to manage through this inflationary environment. Compared to the prior year's quarter, we saw 150 basis point swing in product mix from discretionary to consumables. In Q2, consumables represented 77.3% of Family Dollar sales compared to 75.8% in Q2 of 2021.\n The turnaround of Family Dollar is an enormous value creation lever, and it is getting a great deal of focus and attention. Components of the transformation include, as Rick mentioned, a focus on our people, the DC network and supply chain, pricing and the value proposition as well as our technology. Additional factors include enhancing our culture, elevating store standards, developing our private brands, improving category adjacencies, enhancing the product mix, optimizing vendor partnerships and much more. We are pushing forward on each one of these fronts.\n We are still early in this journey, but I am enthusiastic about the progress we have made just in the last few months. I want to call out, in particular, the important initiative we have taken on our pricing at Family Dollar. With the recent price investments, we believe Family Dollar is now in a better competitive position on price than it has been for over a decade. We will continue to refine the Family Dollar value proposition to drive store traffic and productivity, and we will fully expect to see great benefits from these and other actions over time.\n During the quarter for Family Dollar, we opened 95 new stores, renovated 257 stores and relocated 24 stores. We ended the quarter with more than 540 Combo Stores, which continue to resonate with the shoppers while driving more productivity and more profitability.\n Moving now to the Dollar Tree segment. The Dollar Tree banner delivered another strong quarter. Among the highlights, a 7.5% comp; a 37.4% gross margin, 500 basis points above the prior year's quarter; and a 15.4% operating margin, more than 500 basis points over Q2 of last year. The 7.5% comp sales increase was driven by a 14.2% increase in average ticket partially offset by a traffic decline of 5.8%.\n Importantly, the consumable business at Dollar Tree was strong. Consumables, which represented 46.8% of the mix in Q2, comped at 7.9%, while discretionary increased 6.7%. The last time the consumable comp exceeded discretionary was at the onset of the pandemic in Q1 of 2020. This demonstrates the success we are seeing in key traffic-driving categories where our merchants have been active in enhancing value, such as carbonated beverage, snacks and cookies and food. As a reminder, our reassortment consumables has been more immediate than the discretionary merchandise given the purchasing cycle, and our sales performance demonstrates that shoppers are reacting favorably to refine the value proposition.\n Renewed consumables momentum is a good indicator for our continued long-term health of the Dollar Tree banner. The discretionary side of the business was strong despite the negative impact of the limited global supply of helium, which hindered sales of balloon products and the party-related merchandise. Regarding cadence, similar to Family Dollar, comps were relatively balanced throughout the quarter with each month's comping increasing between 6.5% and 8.5%.\n During the quarter for Dollar Tree, we opened 32 new stores and relocated 5 stores, and we added multi-price assortment to another 697 stores, bringing the total to 2,170 stores as we head into the back half of 2022 and the important holiday season. I would like to speak to what we are seeing in the business as consumers continue to be burdened by levels of inflation not experienced in decades.\n Overall, sales performance remains in line with our expectations. And in fact, we have modestly increased expectations for Family Dollar for the back half. There are signs of trade down to our stores, and we are focused on the value proposition for both banners in this environment. Like many retailers, we are seeing a shift in consumable preferences as many shoppers are gravitating to needs-based consumables, which is impacting our margin through product mix.\n Our suppliers are being hit with -- by inflation as well. This, along with our commitments to competitive pricing and the value proposition, is expected to negatively impact our gross margins in the near term. Over time, we believe our business should be able to protect its merchandising margin from inflation effects. And regarding supply chains, from a sourcing perspective, a year ago, we had a backlog of thousands of containers we were working to get through the transpacific shipping lanes. This year, we have a small, manageable backlog.\n Kevin will go into more detail regarding our updated outlook for the back half of the year. Our outlook will be reduced with most of the guidance reduction related to the Family Dollar as we take action to improve that banner. Of the total, more than half of our guidance reduction is due to pricing actions taken at Family Dollar. The remainder is due to mix shift differences and inflationary cost increases on consumables at both banners. None of this dampens my enthusiasm for our long-term prospects.\n I'll now hand the call over to Kevin to provide more color on Q2 and our updated outlook. Thanks, Kevin. As we continue to navigate through this dynamic and somewhat uncertain environment, we are excited about the continued progress at Dollar Tree and the material positive changes beginning to be made at Family Dollar. At Dollar Tree, as it relates to our multi-price offering, the team is continuing to refine the $3 and $5 assortment and testing various concepts to enhance the program and build on the very positive long-term impact from our multi-price offering.\n For example, test of multi-price frozen foods are driving exceptional sales productivity as the new offering is delivering tremendous value and meeting family portion needs such as frozen meals, pizza and ice cream. At Family Dollar, our Combo Store initiative continues to drive improved store performance at very attractive levels, in line with previous commentary. In fact, we are now exploring various sizes and formats in other markets beyond our rural target locations, pursued in our first iteration of the concept.\n Some of the initiatives to improve the business will take more time to produce an impact, notably in the supply chain and technology. That said, at Family Dollar, the work being done by Larry Gatta's merchandising and marketing teams has been remarkable and is beginning to be actioned upon more urgently. In fact, we have made a number of enhancements to our H2 strategic store format. We refer to the new version as H2.5. Among the changes made to improve store productivity, customer satisfaction and to better support our store associates through efficiencies include: adding a linear footage, developing seasonal assortments as a focal point, utilizing deeper shelving on key consumable categories to enhance store efficiencies and improve in-stocks, expanding the direct-to-store delivery offering, enhancing space dedicated to snacks and increasing the beverage offering and optimizing the frozen food assortments.\n At our Leadership Summit, the merchandising team shared the field leaders a wide array of consumables and discretionary merchandising initiatives to drive traffic and sales at Family Dollar. Our marketing teams are currently focused on 4 key initiatives: refreshing Family Dollar's brand positioning, evolving to a more productive ad program, relaunching our Smart Coupon program and expanding our Boys & Girls Clubs of America partnership to be a good partner in the communities that we serve.\n We believe that these key initiatives are beginning to have an impact, and consumers are increasingly looking to our stores to meet their needs. We believe the time is right to accelerate actions to better serve customers by providing an exceptional value proposition. We will go into more details on these initiatives and broader plans to transform Family Dollar and continue delivering great success at Dollar Tree in the quarters ahead and at our Investor Day in the spring of 2023.\n And I want to briefly share a few initiatives that Bobby Aflatooni's IT team are focused on to provide better support for our stores. These include: improving DC and store in-stock service levels through refinement of our demand forecasting, allocation and replenishment systems for both banners; improving customer satisfaction and driving through enhanced ability to support more complex promotional offers, such as buy a product A and get a discount on the product B; supporting field leadership and store efficiencies with improved labor systems; and enhancing our enterprise-wide data integration platforms.\n Before we go into Q&A, as I had previously announced, Kevin will be transitioning out of his role as Dollar Tree's CFO. Kevin has been instrumental in the company's growth and success since joining the organization in 2008. During Kevin's tenure, Dollar Tree has grown from 3,600 stores to more than 16,200 stores, from annual sales of $4.6 billion to more than $26 billion and from annual operating profits of $365 million to more than $1.8 billion. When Kevin joined Dollar Tree in December 2008, shares were trading at a split adjusted price of just $13 or $14 per share. I would like to publicly thank Kevin for his commitment, stewardship and significant contributions to Dollar Tree and its stakeholders over the last 14 years.\n Operator, we are now ready to take questions. No, I think Rick said it right. On the store side, I think the biggest thing is, is we're focusing the entire organization from a culture perspective on doing everything that we can do to make our store associates successful and enabling them to run better, cleaner, fuller stores. And we've -- I said -- I shared in my opening that we're here right now from our summit with -- every district manager in the country is here, and we are all aligned behind driving better store conditions.\n And that's going to entail in your question is, yes, we're going to continue to invest, and as Kevin said, into our property management and in everything we need to, to make sure our store conditions are the way -- to our standards for our customers, and we're committed to do that. And more importantly, our associates are enthusiastic, not only about the culture of supporting them and putting them at the center of everything that we do. But then they see the proof points of we're investing in pricing, we're improving our logistics. Larry is improving the merchandising, and they're seeing better assortment, more linear footage where the customers shop.\n And then I think Rick nailed it on the supply chain. We're doing everything we can and turning all the leaves over to drive efficiencies and improvements and really ultimately to supply our stores more efficiently with the product they need and when they need it. Yes. Thanks for the question. And like I said earlier, the time is right, right now. And the reason we really looked at it is because we saw new customers shifting our way. In this inflationary environment, we think it's a perfect time to really change the customer's perception and what they're seeing in our stores because we're getting new customers and new eyes in our stores and our existing customers. They're feeling pressured like they never have before.\n And in this inflationary environment, with the customer's wallet stretched, our consumers are relying on our stores to meet their budget goals. And we're seeing good demand trends. So this was really an ideal environment to begin to move more quickly than we previously anticipated to more fully meet the customers' value expectation, close the pricing gaps and win them as customers long term in this inflationary budget. We think the time was right. We -- initially, we talked about it in our outlook, and we were going to do this over time, starting with, of course, our KVIs, the known value items. But then just as we saw the dynamic environment, the pressure on our customers and the inflation, we decided that now is the time to win these customers for the long term and get it right.\n And to your question, it's now. It's -- we are -- like I said, we are in the best price position in over 10 years to the competitive market. So we're there. Now it's just managing it from here. And getting right on our promotions. And Larry is going to continue rocking the H2.5 in the assortment. So we're in a great place right now. Yes. Thanks for the question. And as I shared, it was pretty stable throughout the summer at Dollar Tree on our comp, 6.5% to 8.5%. And remember that -- and Dollar Tree really does well around the seasons. And in the second quarter, the biggest season is graduation. And you heard Kevin say we were really impacted by helium supply in one of our largest categories. That really has a halo effect over party. So largest category, most profitability for Dollar Tree. So that was one of the impacts.\n On the good news, the other big season is lawn and garden, and lawn and garden season was one of the top 5 categories. So when we had the product, our customer is responding very, very well. And then the other categories that did well is, as Kevin said and I said, the shift to consumables, and our merchants reassorted and reinvested in the consumable items to drive traffic. The other top 5 categories, again, were beverages, candy, snacks and cookies and food.\n So our customers are responding very, very well. And early in -- it's really early into Q3, but we see so far this month trending better than Q2 at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar both. And as you think about the margins in the back, where we're at -- as Kevin shared, our inventory is up. But remember, this time last year, we had thousands of containers at origin, meaning it wasn't even at our system. It wasn't even at the origin yet.\n So now all that is in our system. We're getting our seasonal on time. And it's also -- remember, our merchants at Dollar Tree bought for the back half at the $1.25. The product is amazing. All of our district managers, regional directors, all of our field associates are here with us right now. And they see the exciting items, and they're thrilled. A, we've got the product when we want it; and B, newly assorted $1.25 will blow the market away, and our customers are going to respond well. And we're very excited about it. Kevin can kind of touch on some of the margin puts and takes in the back half. Yes. We expect improvement in our transactions, especially as -- the pricing moves that we've made, the assortment changes that Larry Gatta and the merchants are making and bringing in some new adjacencies and our seasonal product that we have ready. Just a little pressure -- as you said, our customer is pressured like none other. And the good news is, is we're excited. We see third-party data that we do have a lot of new customers coming into both banners over last year. And the majority of them are at a household income of $80,000 or higher. So we feel good about that. We also see a huge shift from cash into credit, which tells us the customer is pressured.\n And then inside the store, when they get in there, we've seen in the industry where private brands have outpaced national brands for 24 weeks in a row now, 24 weeks in a row. That hasn't happened in the last 5 years, that private brands has outpaced national brands. And that's the customer trying to stretch their dollar and manage their budget. And Larry and the team are working hard on our private brands, and we're seeing the same change inside of our store.\n And then they're even making decisions on form and function. We see them moving from liquid to powder detergent. We're seeing them even go without softener -- liquid softener in detergents. They're just choosing not to have softener. And those are the things that our customers are -- and the decisions they're making. And we think right now, with the price investments and the changes that Larry is making and our new assortment at Dollar Tree, we're in a wonderful position to meet their needs in 16,000 stores conveniently located where they don't have to drive far. We'll meet their needs, and we're excited about it going forward. Yes. And Bobby is -- that's a great question. And our team is forming right now. And I think from an OpEx perspective, we're going to continue to invest in labor where we need to. And there will be payroll investments going forward. For this year, as far as we can see with the dynamic markets going on, it is embedded in our forecast.\n From the IT and supply chain, I think those are the 2 big ones. And what Bobby is looking at right now, the good news is, and I think Rick mentioned it, Bobby knows every one of our systems. And he knows exactly what he needs to do because he's done this before at other retailers, and he's worked with the 2 executives in supply chain and merchandising.\n So Bobby is working really hard. And I will owe you that number probably up in the spring when we have our Investor Day because that is going to be a longer-term outlook, and the majority of it is going to be in CapEx.\n And then the same thing with supply chain. We're looking at what is the best way to deliver to our stores, what's the most efficient way to use our network to deliver our Combo Stores, our Dollar Tree Plus stores and, of course, our traditional Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores.\n And John is working on that now and modeling it out, and we'll probably have more information on the spring as the -- as we have more knowledge from the 2 leaders. Our CFO that we just announced is going to be coming on board and will certainly have a say in it and will want to look at it.\n But those are the 2 big investments. But in our OpEx and in our forecast, from a repair and maintenance and store conditions perspective, we have those embedded in, and we will probably come back to you if there's any other longer-term initiatives that will impact that. Yes. And in theory, I think you're right. But our pricing investment is in, and then we're just going to manage that going forward on that side of it. I think we will lean in on our investments on supply chain and IT, but these are things that take time just because of the amount of systems that you are touching. And as Rick said, it's our -- as our store and retail systems, as our supply chain systems and then our merchandising systems. So that will take time, and we will stage that over our capability.\n And then the supply chain will be -- as we roll out and open new distribution centers, that's when we will continue to rightsize our network and make decisions going forward. So we will continue to move with speed that will give us the highest return as quick as possible. Yes. No, I think the biggest change is the dynamic of the marketplace and the huge shift from discretionary to consumables, not the shift about our $1.25. We did some in-depth customer research and customer intercepts about Dollar Tree at the beginning of the quarter. And we really wanted to dig into our brand and the assortment and in-store experience. And I was shocked. Not one of them brought up price. Not one of them brought up the $1.25.\n They were all focused on clean, new assortments, seasonal and the service of the -- what they have when they're in the stores. So I think the customers move beyond that because as we tested early on, they understand value more than ever. And in today's dynamics, they see that $1.25 is an exceptional value. That's why all these new items and consumables are all taking off.\n And why I'm excited about the back half -- and to your point, the second quarter did not really have any big season. Dollar Tree is all about the seasons. We change like the leaves on the trees. Well, in the summer, the leaves aren't changing because you've got lawn and garden and then you've got graduation, and graduation was impacted by helium. On the back half, Kevin said we've got 2,000 -- 2,100 actually, Dollar Tree Pluses that we didn't have. So that's going to be -- that's exciting about the back half.\n And then our inventory. We've got all of our seasonal inventory at $1.25. And they will rally around this seasonal merchandise, just like they did in the first quarter with Valentine's and Easter. We expect some exciting things and great response from our customers because we're in a great inventory position. The value is spectacular. And then on the basic side, we've answered that on the consumables that we didn't have last year at this time. So I'm pretty excited about the back half of Dollar Tree. Yes, Scott, and thanks. Early on, we shared that we're investing over $195 million, just under $200 million in our payroll, the majority of it in our store associates and some of it in our DCs. We feel really good where we're at in our distribution centers. We've got all of our roles filled compared to this time last year where we didn't have open positions. We are continuing to invest in markets in the stores and at retail stores, and we will continue to do that where we see the need.\n Looking out over the back half of the year, where we need to make adjustments is already in our forecast. So it's a dynamic environment. Now people are coming back to work a little bit just because of what's going on in the economy. So I think that's going to shift a little bit, but we will continue to invest where we need to. And so far, in the next 6 months, looking for the rest of the year, we have what we need to invest in the forecast. Yes, I was just going to say, I just got done saying the excitement on the Dollar Tree side. Our assortment and the investments we've made into the new $1.25 on the consumable side is driving traffic. And just to put that in perspective, we haven't seen that kind of improvement in consumables, which drives traffic since pre pandemic. So that's our investment, and that's how we're driving traffic, along with the unbelievable assortment coming up that they're going to see inside our store for the seasons coming up. Unlike anybody else, Dollar Tree -- the $1.25 is the best value, the best wow and the most excitement.\n And then on the Family Dollar side, this pricing, again, we just put ourselves in a position to be the best price to the market in over 10 years. That alone will drive traffic, not even mentioning what Larry Gatta and the merchants are doing with enhancing our H2.5 with a tighter assortment, more meaningful prices, take advantage of more linear foot, so getting more product on the shelf that the customer is looking for. And then getting seasonal upfront and center. So I'm really excited about the moves that we've made.\n Now as you know, it takes time for the customer -- we've got new customers coming in that are recognizing it. And then over time, we will see and get credit for being priced right, better assortment, better position on the Family Dollar side.\n And Larry's -- and I mentioned purposefully on marketing, we've got 4 great marketing perspectives going on with our digital marketing, with our print ad, and Larry is really working on exactly what do we need to advertise that the customer responds to that drives traffic. So those are all the levers that the merchants and Larry are pulling on the Family Dollar side, and I'm just thrilled about what we got going on, on the Dollar Tree side to keep growing."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 6.7% to $6.77 billion, comprised of $3.57 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.19 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.9%. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 7.5%, and Family Dollar same-store sales increased 2%. At both banners, the increase in average ticket more than offset the decline in transaction count as shoppers continue to consolidate trips as gas prices are significantly higher than a year ago. Gross profit improved 14.2% to $2.12 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 31.4% compared to 29.4% in the prior year's quarter.\n Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 500 basis points to 37.4% compared to 32.4% for the same period last year as a result of the net of the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 455 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise. Occupancy costs decreased 50 basis points from leverage on the comp sales increase. Distribution costs decreased 20 basis points from leverage and higher capitalized amounts due to increases in inventory levels partially offset by higher hourly wages and higher DC maintenance and compliance costs. And shrink increased 20 basis points primarily from more favorable results in relation to accruals in the prior year quarter.\n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased 140 basis points to 24.7% compared to 26.1% for the same period last year. The factors include markdown costs increased 80 basis points due to higher promotional and price action markdowns. Shrink increased 45 basis points primarily from more favorable results in relation to accruals in the prior year quarter. And merchandise costs, including freight, increased 15 basis points, primarily due to higher freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise, partially offset by higher initial mark-on.\n Similar to Q1, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 100 basis points. The SG&A rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 23% in Q2 last year with Dollar Tree favorable to prior year, more than offset by Family Dollar and slightly higher corporate costs. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment improved 30 basis points to 22% when compared to the prior year's quarter.\n Payroll costs improved 90 basis points from leverage on the 7.5% comp and favorable development of workers' comp claims, partially offset by the annualization of minimum wage increases and investments in store payroll; other SG&A, which increased approximately 40 basis points, resulting from unfavorable development of general liability insurance claims; and inflationary pressure across several expense categories. Facilities costs increased 10 basis points primarily from higher utility and repairs and maintenance as we focus on improving store conditions. For the Family Dollar segment, the second quarter SG&A rate increased 200 basis points to 23% compared to 21% in the prior year's quarter.\n Payroll expenses increased 70 basis points, primarily due to hourly wages and investment in store payroll and an increase in workers' compensation expense due to favorable accrual adjustments in the prior year, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. Store facility costs increased 50 basis points, primarily from higher utility costs and an increase in repairs and maintenance expense as we focus on improved store conditions for our customers and associates. Other SG&A expenses increased 45 basis points due to higher legal fees, debit and credit card transaction fees, store supply expense and inflationary pressure across several expense categories.\n Depreciation and amortization increased 30 basis points related to elevated capital expenditures for store renovations and improvements. Corporate support and other expense as a percentage of total revenue was 1.5% compared to the prior year quarter of 1.3%. The higher costs primarily consist of increased stock compensation costs.\n Operating income improved 25.7% to $505.4 million or 7.5% of total revenue in the second quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to a year ago. Nonoperating expenses totaled $30.7 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense. The effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 23.5% in the prior year's quarter, resulting from higher state tax rates and lower work opportunity tax credits as a percentage of pretax income in the current year's quarter.\n Net income for the quarter improved 27.4% to $359.9 million or $1.60 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $282.4 million or $1.23 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.\n Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $689 million compared to $985 million at the end of fiscal 2021. Outstanding debt as of July 30 was $3.45 billion. The company repurchased approximately 1.66 million shares at an average price of $141.67 in Q2 or $235.8 million under the share repurchase authorization.\n Compared to last year, inventory levels at Dollar Tree are up 59.7% in dollars due to increased capitalized freight and distribution costs, additional multi-price Plus inventory and a significant increase in import inventory in transit compared to the prior year. Total units per store are up approximately 20% to prepandemic Q2 2019 levels but are expected to normalize as we go through the back half of the year. The inventory is fresh and basic in nature and does not represent a significant markdown risk.\n Inventory levels at Family Dollar increased 35.7% compared to Q2 last year due to increased capitalized freight and distribution costs and an increase in the average unit cost. Total units per store are below prepandemic Q2 2019 levels. Capital expenditures were $276.2 million in the second quarter versus $229.1 million in Q2 of last year. For fiscal 2022, we currently expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.4 billion.\n Depreciation and amortization totaled $193.5 million for Q2 compared to $176.1 million in the second quarter of last year. For fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million.\n As we look to the back half of 2022, we see the following affecting our business. As Mike mentioned, we are accelerating price investments in our Family Dollar business. These investments are designed to improve the value proposition for our shoppers and to drive traffic and store productivity. This investment has a near-term impact on profit, but we expect it to accrue long-term benefit. We have seen consumer purchasing shift based on economic conditions to a more consumable-based basket at both banners, which will negatively impact our expected mix and product margin.\n Dollar Tree's sales continue to be negatively affected by the global helium shortage. This directly affects balloon sales, but also has a halo effect on the entire party department. In general, stores with helium are comping positive in the party category, while those without helium are running negative comps. The delta is a 10%-plus comp differential in one of our largest high-margin discretionary categories.\n Our over-the-counter categories are being negatively affected by our supply chain challenges. This is creating a higher level of out of stocks in this category. We plan to continue to increase our investment in payroll in our stores in the back half. The labor market remains dynamic, and we are proactively addressing select markets to attract and retain associates. We are making investments in our stores and distribution centers through repairs and maintenance as well as compliance programs to ensure a great shopping and working environment.\n Based on these factors, diluted earnings per share for the full year is now expected to range from $7.10 to $7.40. This represents a $0.75 per share adjustment to the prior outlook based on the midpoint and is comprised of the following components. Roughly 60% of the change relates to the price investments at Family Dollar. An estimated 20% of the change relates to the margin impact of the mix shift towards needs-based consumables, projected to be a 300 basis point shift at Family Dollar and a 150 basis point shift at Dollar Tree in the back half. Again, the majority of this impact is expected to be on the Family Dollar side of the business.\n We are experiencing some degree of inflationary-related product cost increases, especially in lower-margin consumables, primarily at Dollar Tree, contributing to approximately 15% of the guide adjustment. As we have for decades, we have the ability to alter or reassort product based on cost changes, but this can take a few quarters, hence the near-term profit impact. And a small component of the guide adjustment relates to other items, including our commitment to improve store conditions.\n As a result of the aforementioned factors, most notably our accelerated price investment, we are expecting Family Dollar to be approximately breakeven from a segment operating margin perspective in the second half, down from its first half margin of approximately 2%. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion with slightly higher comps offset by slightly reduced square footage growth relative to prior guidance. We expect to deliver a mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a positive increase in the Family Dollar segment.\n Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 3.5%, down slightly from prior guidance due to the supply chain delays related to procuring equipment and fixtures for store openings. For Q3, we estimate consolidated net sales will range from $6.75 billion to $6.87 billion based on a mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.20 per share.\n Other considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $31 million in Q3 and $125 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.6% for the third quarter and 23.8% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 224.8 million shares for Q3 and 225.4 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. As of July 30, we had $2.25 billion remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.\n And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. Yes. As you look at it, Matt, obviously, as we talked this year, freight, which was a big headwind last year, and to the first half of this year, we said it would still be a headwind as we annualized last year rates, and we've said that into the back half, then it starts to level out. We still see that. Obviously, with -- if diesel continues to move down, that will be helpful as well. But again, I think as you look at the Dollar Tree gross margin rate, I think Q3 will be a little lower than Q2, but then you'll see it pop back a little bit in Q4, which is highly discretionary quarter for us. So that's kind of the trend you'll see.\n As I think about the multiyear gross margin, as you think about it, again, looking to build traffic, looking to -- as we build the -- again, really changing the stores. We now have 2,000 Dollar Tree Plus stores as we look at, again, continuing to further the assortment of the $1.25 price point. And then would look to see that the freight rates do start to come down and have an effect in next year. So there are some things that will play into that. A little early to really talk specifically. But I think those are kind of the moving pieces as we see them. Well, go ahead."

            "name": "Richard Dreiling",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Mike and I and our new Board have been together for just over one quarter now. As planned and expected, change is underway, and we are moving at a fast pace. We are entirely focused on taking the right steps to transform this organization for the long term through growing and improving Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. We are 90 days further down the road from our last earnings call, and the opportunity and action steps needed continue to become more clear.\n Our main priorities are our associates, the distribution network and supply chain, Family Dollar's pricing and the value proposition in both segments, store standards and technology. Additionally, and Mike will go into more detail, we have a great deal of work underway to improve the company's culture, designed to build an environment of accountability, empowerment, courageous leadership, transparency and fostering two-way dialogue.\n And we are orchestrating these changes in one of the most unique and dynamic environments I've experienced in my retail career. Inflation is at its highest in decades as shoppers are experiencing higher costs related to food, fuel, rent and more. Supply chains have been strained and inconsistent. Inventory levels are higher across retail, and consumer shopping patterns continue to zig and zag.\n Let me be very clear. We are not here to take half measures or to defer high return capital and operating investments in order to manage earnings. We are honed in on taking steps necessary to seize the great opportunity for us and deliver to our shareholders, our associates and our customers the great company they deserve. And by executing on this commitment, we'll deliver the greatest possible risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. We'll not waver from this strategy.\n You will hear from Mike and Kevin later in the call about some of the actions we're taking to fix Family Dollar. As you know, our new leadership team is taking shape, and the team is moving to accelerate actions to improve the business. The most notable action is our decision to move forward with price investments that began in July and will carry into the second half intended to close our historical GAAP and pricing to key competitors.\n We believe this is a necessary action to provide the right value proposition and a foundational step to improve Family Dollar long term and that it will pay off handsomely. There is much more to do to enhance the results of Family Dollar, and you will hear about some positive improvements beginning to be made later in the call. That said, the refreshed team has been together for about a quarter, and we feel very confident in our ability to fix Family Dollar and materially improve its performance long term and in the process, create enormous value.\n We are a growth company. We are making change happen to create long-term shareholder value and enable the next waves of profitable growth for Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. On behalf of our Board, I want to thank each of our teams for their efforts on delivering very good results for the second quarter.\n I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Yes, I'll start here and then turn it over to Michael. The positive, I have to tell you, the enthusiasm within the organization, and its willingness to embrace change. The interesting thing has been, there's not a lot of things we're talking about that people, Chuck, aren't shaking their head, yes, let's go get it done. So that, to me, is the foundation of this. And the company has made a major commitment to culture enhancement. In fact, we spent our near whole day just talking about how to manage people and how people need to be managed. And we spent a whole day just listening to people to hear what they're dealing with.\n Probably on the negative side, the pricing gap was a little bit larger than we thought. And we also believe this is a great time for customer trial, and we want to be right on our pricing. In terms of the supply chain side, we're looking at everything in the supply chain. We are assembling, I think Mike would agree, probably one of the best supply chain teams in the country. We have a lot of distribution centers that need to be updated and modernized. So we're feeling really good on how we're approaching that.\n The IT side, information technology, I might classify as a little bit bigger surprise in that there's a lot of basic things that the operators and the merchants need and the supply chain needs. So with that, Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything? I think the answer to that is we're very comfortable with where we are on the gross margin in Dollar Tree for the back half of the year and going forward. And I will say we are working our way with the vendor community, with vendor support, and we anticipate that the Family Dollar margin will improve over time."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Dollar Tree, Inc. First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.\n At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Randy Guiler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss results for Dollar Tree's First Fiscal Quarter 2022. With me on today's call are Executive Chairman, Rick Dreiling; President and CEO, Mike Witynski; and CFO, Kevin Wampler.\n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about our expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements.

We caution against reliance on the forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements, except as required by law.\n Following our prepared remarks, Mike and Kevin will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. And before I turn the call over to Rick, I want to make one quick clarification to our earnings release as I've received a few questions this morning. Our original fiscal 2022 EPS outlook of $7.60 to $8 per share did not include the $0.43 per share of cost outlined in today's earnings release. $0.13 of the $0.43 per share was incurred in Q1 and reduced our Q1 earnings. Our updated outlook for EPS of $7.80 to $8.20 per share does include the $0.43 per share of cost.\n And I'll now turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. It's been an extremely busy 10 weeks since joining the Dollar Tree team. I've been actively meeting with the leaders throughout the organization to get to know them and their businesses and to discuss priorities and opportunities. We see a massive opportunity ahead of us to drive long-term sustainable value creation through the combined Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands. It's abundantly clear to us that to deliver this long-term opportunity, we're going to be going from a great company and that change is needed.\n We are fully committed to transform Dollar Tree from a good company today to a great company tomorrow. We have this unique opportunity to become a growth engine that delivers profitable growth with attractive returns on capital for many years to come. However, to get from here to there, we must build the foundation to fuel this engine. We need to invest in the areas that most positively impact the associate and shopper experience. These investments are intended to greatly improve the performance of the Family Dollar segment and our supply chain as well as support the continued momentum at Dollar Tree.\n We'll be focusing on our people, most importantly, our teams from store and distribution center associates to field leadership through competitive wages, improved store and DC conditions and enhanced safety. The distribution center network and supply chain presents us with a golden opportunity to amplify efficiencies and deliver greater support to our stores and elevated service to our shoppers through improved in-stock positions.\n Pricing at Family Dollar and the value proposition at both banners, we need to be right on price at Family Dollar, on par with our primary competitors, and we will work directly with our suppliers to drive greater store productivity. Dollar Tree has a long history of exceeding customer expectations by offering extreme value. We will continue to place a great emphasis on the value proposition at Dollar Tree.\n And finally, technology. We are simply not where we need to be from a systems perspective to reach our potential. We have recently begun a comprehensive review of all of our systems and infrastructure to make the right decisions and investments to take Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to the next level.\n I felt great about the long-term opportunity for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar before I got here. Now that I've been inside the organization for 2 months, I feel better than ever. I have full confidence in the team and our Board of Directors as we embark on this much needed transformational growth journey. The Dollar Tree banner is generating renewed momentum, and we will be taking the necessary steps to enable Family Dollar to seize the opportunity to deliver long-term operating performance improvements.\n We are in the midst of a very challenging time for consumers as many are living paycheck to paycheck. They are facing the highest inflation since the early 1980s, record high gas prices, the effects from the pandemic, geopolitical uncertainty and much more. In tough times, value retail can be part of the solution to help families stretch their dollars to meet their evolving needs. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar provide convenience as our 16,000-plus stores are located close to millions of households to live and work.\n Mike and I view our organization as a growth company. Now is the ideal time to shift gears for us to make change happen to unlock shareholder value and enable the next wave of profitable growth for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.\n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thank you, Rick. And it's good to have you here with us, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The team delivered a solid start to the year with a 6.5% top line sales expansion, a 19.2% lift to gross profit and a 48.1% increase to earnings per share. During the quarter, the Dollar Tree team successfully completed its conversion to the $1.25 price point, contributing to both sales and margin improvements. Shoppers are responding favorably as the new greater value products hit our shelves.\n Importantly, other key strategic initiatives, including the expansion of the $3 and $5 Plus assortment in our Dollar Tree stores, as well as our Combo Stores and H2 renovations at Family Dollar are all working. Rick outlined the types of additional strategic investments we will be making over the next several years that are designed to position the company for improved operating performance and long-term sustainable growth.\n Before I discuss Q1 performance by segment, I want to share a few details regarding a very eventful quarter for the company. In mid-March, our Board was reconstituted. We now have a new Executive Chair, a new Vice Chair and Lead Director -- Lead Independent Director and a total of 7 new directors. We also have 2 new Board committees, a Finance Committee and a Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee.\n This week, we published our new 2022 CSR report. I am proud of the progress we are making as a company and the team's effort on sustainability. Please check out the new CSR report in the Corporate Governance portion of our website at DollarTreeinfo.com.\n Rick and I have been working very closely together. We share a common vision for a long-term growth opportunity for the Dollar Tree organization. That value will be created by a combination of Dollar Tree's unique and resilient business model that is demonstrating its earnings power and momentum with its recent initiatives, along with a material improvement over time, and the operating performance of our Family Dollar banner. We are well underway with plans and priorities to address the performance at Family Dollar. I will share more detail later on this call.\n Also, 2 weeks ago, we announced the addition of 2 key executives to our leadership team. John Flanigan joined the company as Chief Supply Chain Officer. John brings decades of leadership experience in retail logistics, including grocery, drugstore and the value sectors. John will be extremely focused on elevating our supply chain capabilities through improved distribution operations, hiring and retaining of teams, the efficiency improvements throughout supply chain designed to drive greater store productivity through improved in-stock position. He plans to lead productivity improvements across the logistics function by the use of data analytics, process improvement and automation.\n Additionally, Larry Gatta has joined the team as Chief Merchandising Officer for the Family Dollar segment. Larry brings more than 35 years of retail merchandising and marketing experience. He is well known and respected throughout the vendor community and will be leading plans to drive our business, and in turn, the business of our supply partners. Larry will be focused on improving Family Dollar's operating performance and productivity through sales-driving initiatives that provide great value for our shoppers.\n In addition to the investments we are outlining today, components of our transformation were driven by a number of factors, including continuing to enhance our culture, elevated store standards, better use of private brands, improved category adjacencies, enhancing our product mix, optimizing our vendor partnerships and many, many more.\n To some degree today, and especially in the quarters ahead, you can expect to receive more details, improved transparency and greater management engagement in shareholder communications as we progress on our plans to improve the operating performance and reassess the long-term opportunities for the company. We are currently in the process of planning an Investor Day targeted for October time frame.\n Now to Q1 performance. The Dollar Tree banner delivered its strongest quarter in company history. Among the highlights: an 11.2% comp, the best quarterly comp performance in more than 20 years, which is including our largest sales day ever, which was the Saturday before Easter; a 40.6% gross profit margin, nearly 700 basis points above the prior year's quarter; and a company record 20.2% operating margin, more than 800 basis points over Q1 of last year.\n Margins in Q1 did receive an outsized temporary benefit from the initial transition to the new price point as well as selling through the current inventories. We are modeling a moderation of the margin level as we focus on providing our shoppers with new assortments at greater value for the $1.25 price point. The 11.2% comp sales increase was driven by a 15.4% increase in average ticket partially offset by a traffic decline of 3.6%. For the quarter, the discretionary side of the business delivered a strong 14.1% comp increase, while consumables increased 8%. April, which benefited from the later Easter holiday this year, was the strongest month in terms of both sales and traffic.\n Importantly, we successfully completed the conversion to a primary price point of $1.25 across the chain. Credit to our teams. This project was announced in September of 2021 and was completed by the end of February with minimal disruption. By the end of Q1, our customers have already seen more than 960 of our projected 2,000 new greater value product SKUs on the shelves. Our shoppers are responding to the new items. We are seeing much improved results in the categories since rolling out the enhanced offering.\n Examples of the consumables category comp improvements where we've put in these new items: carbonated beverage, from a 3% decline to a 12% increase now; in snacks and cookies, before the new SKUs, we had a decline of 8%, now a 12% increase in comp; and in our food category, from a 10% decline before to now experiencing a 2% increase. The majority of the changes at this early stage are now traffic-driving consumable side of the business. The discretionary changes will occur throughout the back half of the year.\n The $1.25 assortment changes are notable and easy to see when you visit Dollar Tree stores. In today's environment, where consumers are seeing higher prices everywhere, shoppers know they can rely on Dollar Tree as their destination for extreme value and evolving meaningful assortment and a thrill of the hunt.\n The Family Dollar banner had a big hurdle to climb in Q1. In 2020, Family Dollar had a 15.5% quarterly comp increase at the onset of COVID. And in last year's quarter, there was a record release of stimulus dollars that positively impacted both top line sales and margin with the lift in discretionary sales.\n For Q1, Family Dollar's comps declined 2.8%, which represents a nearly 10% comp since 2019. The 2.8% comp sales decrease was comprised of 3.7% decline in traffic partially offset by a 1% increase in average ticket. For the quarter, the consumable side of the business delivered a 1.2% comp increase, while discretionary comps were down 14.7% as we cycled the massive release of stimulus dollars last year. February represented the best comp month for the quarter, and April was slightly better than the quarter's comp.\n Importantly, Family Dollar's comp sales for the quarter were negatively impacted by an estimated 200 basis points by the temporary closures of approximately 400 Family Dollar stores served by our Arkansas distribution center. All of these stores have now reopened.\n Last week, we announced that we will be closing the 30-year-old West Memphis, Arkansas distribution center that we have deemed is no longer part of our go-forward strategy. We are working closely with the impacted associates to support them with their transitions by providing severance plans to those eligible, helping associates with opportunities in our other distribution centers and in our stores as well as providing outplacement services and employee assistant programs. We are reallocating stores to other DCs to fulfill the store deliveries and have sufficient capacity to serve all stores in our remaining fleet of distribution centers. We appreciate the hard work and support of West Memphis associates committed during the transition process.\n I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide more color on Q1 and our updated outlook. \nKevin Wampler: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 6.5% to $6.9 billion comprised of $3.78 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.12 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.4% despite cycling the large outflow of stimulus from the prior year's quarter. This represented a 190 basis point sequential improvement from Q4.\n Costs for the Dollar Tree segment increased 11.2%. Family Dollar same-store sales decreased 2.8%. And on a 3-year stack basis, Dollar Tree is at a 15% comp, and Family Dollar is at a 9.9% comp. Gross profit improved 19.2% to $2.34 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 33.9% compared to 30.3% in the prior year's quarter.\n Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 690 basis points to 40.6% compared to 33.7% for the same period last year as a result of the net of the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 590 basis points, primarily due to increased initial mark-on and increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise, partially offset by higher freight costs. Occupancy costs decreased 80 basis points from leverage on the comp sales increase. Distribution costs decreased 50 basis points from leverage and higher capitalized balances resulting from inventory increases in the current quarter partially offset by higher hourly wages. And markdown costs increased 30 basis points primarily from markdowns for clearance items as we move to a higher value assortment at the $1.25 price point.\n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased 100 basis points to 25.8% compared to 26.8% for the same period last year. Markdown costs increased 75 basis points due to higher clearance activity related to the shipping delays for seasonal items and slow-moving merchandise. Occupancy costs increased 45 basis points from deleverage from the comparable store sales decrease and higher real estate taxes.\n Shrink increased 25 basis points for more favorable inventory results in relation to accruals in the prior year's quarter. These increases were partially offset by distribution costs that decreased 15 basis points, primarily from higher capitalized balances from inventory increases, partially offset by our higher hourly wages. And merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 35 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise.\n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 100 basis points to 23.3% compared to 22.3% in Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment improved 120 basis points to 20.4% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 100 basis points from leverage on the 11.2% comp partially offset by hourly wages and investments in store payroll.\n Facility costs improved 25 basis points from leverage. Depreciation costs decreased approximately 10 basis points, partially offset by other SG&A, which increased approximately 15 basis points resulting from higher store supply costs.\n For the Family Dollar segment, the first quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue increased 280 basis points to 23% compared to 20.2% in the prior year's quarter. Payroll expenses increased 90 basis points primarily due to hourly wage and investment in store payroll as well as deleverage on the comp sales decline.\n Other SG&A expenses increased 85 basis points due to asset impairment for the West Memphis DC, along with higher store supply expenses for store projects and higher legal fees. Store facility costs increased 65 basis points primarily from costs associated with removal of product from stores in connection with the voluntary product recall as well as deleverage on the comp decline. And depreciation and amortization increased 40 basis points due to increased depreciation related to capital expenditures for store renovations and improvements.\n Corporate, support and Other expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 1.8% compared to the prior year quarter of 1.4%. The higher costs related to increased legal fees, including the reconstitution of our Board, and incentive compensation.\n Operating income improved 40.7% to $731.5 million or 10.6% of total revenue in the first quarter. Nonoperating expenses totaled $34 million comprised of net interest expense, and the effective tax rate was 23.1% for both the current and prior year's quarter. Net income for the quarter improved 43.2% to $536.4 million or $2.30 per diluted share, which includes $0.13 per share for costs related to the West Memphis DC. This compared to net earnings of $374.5 million or $1.60 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.\n Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.22 billion compared to $985 million at the end of fiscal 2021. Outstanding debt as of April 30 were $3.45 billion. The company repurchased approximately 90,000 shares in Q1 for approximately $14.2 million under the share repurchase authorization.\n Compared to last year, inventory levels at Dollar Tree are up 39% due to increased capitalized freight costs plus Dollar Tree Plus inventory and a catch-up in past due inventories. Inventory levels at Family Dollar increased 27% compared to [indiscernible] last year due to increased capitalized freight and an increase in the average unit cost. Both banners have less average inventory units in store than at the same period in 2019 pre-pandemic.\n Capital expenditures were $253.4 million in the first quarter versus $224.9 million in Q1 of last year. And for fiscal 2022, we currently expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately [indiscernible], slightly higher than our initial outlook for the year based on additional supply chain projects and construction cost pressures.\n Depreciation and amortization totaled $188.9 million for Q1 compared to $172.7 million in the first quarter of the last year. And for fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million.\n In March, our initial outlook for fiscal 2022, diluted EPS was a range of $7.60 to $8. We expect to incur costs totaling an estimated $0.43 per share, which were not included in our original outlook. These costs represent: in Q1, $0.13 per share for asset impairment and the product recall costs related to our West Memphis DC; for Q2, an estimated $0.22 per share for lost sales, freight, merchandise disposal, payroll and legal costs associated with the West Memphis matter; and for full year fiscal 2022, a total of $0.08 per share for stock compensation expense related to an option grant issued to our new Executive Chairman.\n Diluted earnings per share for the full year is now expected to range from $7.80 to $8.20, which includes the $0.43 of costs I've just outlined. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $27.76 billion to $28.14 billion compared to our previous range of $27.22 billion to $27.85 billion. We expect to deliver a mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a more or less flat comparable store sales in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 3.9%. \n For Q2, we estimate consolidated net sales to range from $6.65 billion to $6.78 billion based on a low to mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, and this estimate includes approximately $0.24 per share for costs for the West Memphis matter and stock compensation expense.\n Considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following. We anticipate that we will continue to experience uncertainty related to inflation, the global supply chain and geopolitical factors. For example, we have seen diesel costs continue to rise, and natural gas price increases are affecting utility costs throughout the business. We are once again experiencing shortages in the availability of helium and have not been able to procure the volume [ to fulfill our ] needs, which will negatively affect balloon sales. Our outlook includes our best current estimates of pressures from these factors.\n We cycled the third round of stimulus checks that totaled an estimated $386 billion in March of 2021. In Q2, we will begin cycling the monthly advance Child Tax Credit payments that began in mid-July of 2021.\n We noted that our original outlook in March that we expected to invest $195 million in store and DC associate wages in 2022. As an update, given the competitive retail environment, we expect that we will likely exceed this amount as we invest in our associates.\n Import domestic freight will present cost pressures due to annualization of fiscal '21 rates in the first half of 2022. As noted in March, we plan for diesel fuel prices to be higher this year. We have increased the forecasted amount for the remainder of the year based on the current market. Additional color for the year regarding our expectations include, for the enterprise, we are forecasting improved operating margin for the business driven by gross margin improvements, partially offset by higher SG&A costs as a percentage of total revenue.\n The Dollar Tree segment gross margin in Q1 included an outsized benefit from the transition to the new $1.25 price point. We expect to see a gross margin moderation from the Q1 level as new greater value assortments are incorporated into the business. The Dollar Tree segment is expected to deliver improved operating margin for the year with gross margin benefiting from its strategic initiatives as well as leverage on SG&A.\n The Family Dollar segment gross and operating margins are expected to be lower year-over-year, impacted by the following: higher costs, including freight and needed investments in the business such as labor and improved store conditions; the impact to product mix as a result of stimulus dollars driving discretionary sales in the prior year; and the impact on sales and expenses related to the West Memphis DC matter.\n Net interest expense is expected to be approximately [indiscernible] in Q2 and $123 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.2% for the second quarter and 24% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share count are assumed to be 226.4 million shares for Q2 and 226.5 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchase. And as of April 30, we had $2.5 billion remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.\n I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. \nMichael Witynski: Thanks, Kevin. As Rick mentioned in the opening, we are committed to transform Dollar Tree from a good company to a great company. Our initiatives are working and providing increased profits and cash flow. Rick and I both believe now is the ideal time to accelerate investments focused on driving growth through improved associate and shopper experience while propelling greater efficiencies.\n These strategic initiatives will be designed to position Dollar Tree for long-term sustainable growth. And we are going to invest and incur costs associated with making this journey. It's the right thing to do, and this is the ideal time to invest in our future. Again, to reiterate, we will be investing in our associates and our stores, the DC network and supply chain, Family Dollar pricing and the value proposition and our technology.\n Both Rick and I are committed, aligned and extremely focused. The ability to execute our key strategic initiatives is paying off and setting a solid foundation for improved operating performance and accelerated growth. We believe an -- we delivered an EPS of $5.80 in fiscal 2021. And the midpoint of our guidance range this year is $8, representing a 38% increase. I believe we are at an inflection point to exhibit our earnings power into the years ahead.\n We are committed to meeting our customers' needs while investing in initiatives that are delivering the best returns. These initiatives, combined with our robust balance sheet, will position us to deliver long-term growth for our stakeholders, associates, customers, suppliers and our shareholders. We all know it is incredibly challenging and uncertain time for the businesses today.\n We believe our company offers the following as we manage through these times: stable and resilient business model that has worked at good times and in bad; a 16,000 store footprint that is convenient for shoppers buying their needs; a tremendous value assortment that helps shoppers stretch their budgets; a strong balance sheet that enables us to invest in our business while enhancing our ability to manage and maneuver through the current environment effectively; a road map to deliver shareholder value through improved performance at Family Dollar and improved supply chain and a continued momentum at Dollar Tree.\n We have a fantastic growth story of opening 590 new stores this year alone, driving top line sales growth through key initiatives and, again, an expected 38% year-over-year earnings growth at the midpoint of our range.\n Operator, Kevin and I are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on a nice quarter, and welcome back, Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thanks, Matt. \nMatthew Boss: So maybe just a high-level one for you, Rick. I know you've only been back for a few months. But you described the Dollar Tree organization as a growth organization. So maybe just -- is there a way to speak to any potential timing of initiatives across the banners, how you're thinking about the team that you're assembling around you or just even at a high level, the degree of low-hanging fruit that you see across the concepts to drive what it sounds like your goal is sustainable, profitable growth? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, Matt. I'll throw a little color out here and then turn it over to Mike. We are really taking a good hard look at the entire organization. We're looking at both banners. And the goal here is sustainable long-term growth. And we've got a very good team here, a lot of really solid people, and we're going to supplement them with incremental people that, quite frankly, I've been involved with in my career.\n But the -- as I reflect on this, you have 2 great banners. Dollar Tree is incredibly exciting and fascinating to me. It's the true treasure hunt. The work that's been done on expanding multiple price points, I think, has been great. And now what we have to do is focus on the fundamentals of consumable retailing in Family Dollar. And Mike, what would you like to add to that? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. Matt, I just -- on the timing of our initiatives, you can -- the way we're thinking about it, the short to midterm, we'll be definitely investing in our associates in our stores. And we'll be working on that throughout the quarters. And that's embedded in the guidance that we gave as well as in our pricing. One of our key initiatives is to get sharper on our pricing and close that gap to our key competitors at Family Dollar. And Larry is working on that right now, and we'll be laying that plan in over the next several quarters.\n The longer-term things that Rick -- for our long-term growth is really leveraging and driving efficiencies in our supply chain. And John Flanigan actually is out in one of our DCs today, assessing those things. And then our IT, and we're looking at all of our systems, especially our supply chain, merchandising and storefront systems. So those are bigger capital items, but they're going to take time as we assess them. And I think over the next 2 to 3 years, you'll see those improvements come into the business. \nMatthew Boss: That's great color. And then, Mike, just at the Dollar Tree banner, could you help break down upside in the quarter on the comp side maybe relative to plan that drove that first quarter performance at Dollar Tree? And just speak to customer reception that you're seeing to the new product assortment or the product changes as now you're bringing in the product that was bought for the higher price point, just as it's been introduced, what you're seeing from the customer front. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. That's the exciting part of it. Our Dollar Tree has got such a great reputation for delivering extreme value, and customers have responded well. Our -- throughout the quarter, units were better. Unit decline was better than what we had planned and expected. Unit decline is around the 10-ish mark. Our -- and we shared our transactions are down a little bit more than 4%. Our average ticket is up 15%. So those all feel good for us. And going through the quarter, we're delivering almost half of the new items, and customers are responding very, very favorably.\n And we did -- so the metrics, they're telling us the customers responded. In those categories that we shared, we're seeing -- the last 18 months prior to this change, we were seeing declines in the consumables side and declines in our traffic because of that. But now we reversed in our salty snacks, in our cookies and in our food.\n And also externally, we've done some more extensive research of a second round in the quarter. And customers are highly likely to continue shopping at Dollar Tree after the price change. 85% expressed strong likelihood to shop, 77% are recommending our stores. So our customers still appreciate that great find, the extreme value and the meaningful assortment for them.\n So we feel good about where we're at right now and as we're moving forward. We've only got one quarter under our belt and looking downstream, we're excited about the new assortment coming in. And this is going to take a while for us to really reset our assortment and our level of margin as we cycle through the new items coming in then, of course, add it to our import items. That will really take throughout the next year as we're incorporating those into our import buys. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll next go to Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. \nScot Ciccarelli: Welcome back, Rick. So retail transformations almost always take longer and cost more than us on the outside tend to anticipate. Can you guys provide any color regarding the magnitude of incremental investments that may be required to get Dollar Tree and Family Dollar kind of where you want them from an operational and technological standpoint? \nMichael Witynski: Well, on the Dollar Tree side, as I've said, we've got a lot of momentum because we've been working on this for quite a while. In fact, in the last 2 years, what I'm excited about is during the 2.5 years of COVID and supply chain disruption, we've come out of this and with 2 formats that we didn't have in 2019. We've got a great Combo Store and we broke the $1 to $1.25, and we were enhancing that with $3 and $5 assortments. So we've got some momentum, and our strategies are working. And our cash flow is strong. We've got a great balance sheet. We've got a new reconstituted Board and with Rick on board and including the new talent that we talked about. So we're in a place where we're coming out of, I believe, the era of COVID with great momentum in our strategies, a great balance sheet, a new Board. And we're going to accelerate our growth. So we're not starting today. We're really going to accelerate this going forward.\n So I think on -- as the investments, we will get more detail as we continue to work through this. And that's where we said we're going to have our first Analyst Day in October that we'll be really getting into the more of the nuts and bolts of when to expect as we look at this over the next quarters and years on how we lay that in and the benefit according to -- that goes along with those investments. \nScot Ciccarelli: All right. So there's no way to necessarily bracket or give a general view in terms of how much incremental investment or operating costs might be required? \nMichael Witynski: No, not right now. We've got everything embedded in our outlook for this year. And then we're working really hard. Both Larry and John are looking at those items as we think about how do the beyond years look, and we'll be sharing that in the future. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So first, just on Dollar Tree gross margins. I know you indicated that sequentially, you expect them to moderate versus what you saw in Q1. Is there a ballpark level you can help us frame that for maybe Q2 and the balance of the year? And then just any thinking longer term in terms of where their gross margins are for the banner? At 35% to 36%? Or do you think you could do better than that? \nKevin Wampler: Rupesh, this is Kevin. As we think through this, and obviously, to Mike's point, we're one quarter in, we're still learning a lot as we work through this. There'll be -- so moving pieces as always. The marketplace continues to move as to what investment into the product is going to be necessary to be a value in the marketplace. I would tell you this year, I think at a minimum, we would hope to be to the higher end of that historical range. And if we can be above it, we'll be above it. I don't know that we -- where that will exactly land.\n Again, the environment is such that there's enough uncertainty that it's pretty hard to peg given the fact that the newness of the $1.25 price point and some of the things that are going on, on a macro level out there. But it will be a positive in a big way for the overall company. \nRupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then maybe just my follow-up question. Just on the Family Dollar banner, just given the initiatives that you guys plan to make and some of the capital investments over the coming years, do you guys think you can close the gap with your -- I guess, your closest competitor on the operating margin line? Could you get to a high single-digit operating margin within the Family Dollar banner longer term? \nMichael Witynski: Absolutely. \nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I wanted to try this, just a slightly different angle. So there's obviously been expectations in terms of what your new operating profit margin could look like with all the opportunities that you have at both banners. But as I look at today's press release, everything focuses on investing. So I mean, I wanted to see if you could just triangulate that a little bit. And I mean, I see you'll talk about this at the Analyst Day, but every single header that you had in terms of strategies is investing as opposed to operating margin opportunity. And investors clearly have a high -- very high number in terms of what the actual margin opportunity could look like. So any color on that would be helpful. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. I'll throw it to Kevin for a little bit of color. But the way I think about it, yes, we are investing. But also, we're delivering earnings EPS growth throughout the time and top line growth. So as Rick and I said, the things that we are investing, they will have a return for long-term sustainable growth. And if you look at our EPS from the midpoint range up, it's a 40% -- just under a 40% increase in EPS, and we moved our top line up. So yes, we'll be investing in the future, but we're going to be investing with the thought of continuing to drive that top line and the bottom line at the same time. \nKevin Wampler: The other thing I would say, Karen, as Mike mentioned in his early comments, we do have a new Finance Committee. This committee obviously will be very focused on return on invested capital as we think about things. There are some things we have to do because we need to do it, which is -- you can look at our store standards. We want to make sure we have stores that are -- keep the standards that we expect and our customers deserve. So those are investments you make. But if you look, a lot of this is capital investment in systems and in our supply chain that, again, it's about productivity and efficiency and making it easier at the store level for that store manager and the assistant manager and that team there that's working very hard every day. So our job at the end is to make their job easier. And that's where these investments will -- may have a big payoff at the end of the day. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. And I would just close with our balance sheet and cash flow enables us to do this. We can invest to keep growing our store count to be a growth company. We can invest in the key enablers and supply chain and IT. And we can buy back shares to grow our share. So we've got options going forward. It's not just simply investing in expenses. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So some of the skeptics are arguing that Dollar Tree is going to get a bunch of growth this year from raising its prices by 25% on the bulk of its assortment and seeing some timing benefits from selling through some older cost inventory, and now it's talking about investments. So do you think in light of all that, that the core banner or the enterprise, I should say, can grow both sales and margins next year while you're making these investments? \nMichael Witynski: Yes, we do. \nMichael Lasser: And my follow-up question is -- yes, that's helpful, Mike. My follow-up question is, as you focus your price investments, how do you ensure that you're not going to spark a race to the bottom in light of the very competitive environment that you operate in with some really large competitors? \nMichael Witynski: Yes. And that's important. We've got to be meaningful to our customers first and foremost, and that's what we're going to focus on. And on the other side, we've got Larry here who works very closely with the vendor manufacturers, and we will balance it, right? We'll make good decisions to invest where we need to, to meet the customers' needs in the marketplace. We're just going to simply close the gap to where we are on our KVIs, our key value items, and then just make sure the entire shopping experience is at a great value for our customer. And it's a balance. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Rick, it's really great to hear your voice after all these years. My question is on the traffic decline at Dollar Tree. You talked -- I think you said it was down about 4%. I was just curious how that trended during the quarter, particularly in light of you're introducing more of the new products into the mix. And a follow-up to that would be I think you said 960 SKUs with the plan for 2,000. I think the average Tree store has about 8. So I'm just curious like how many SKUs you want to change? And how do we think about that rollout over the balance of the year? \nMichael Witynski: Well, the 2,000 were the amount that we needed to change. Remember, at last earnings call, our merchants since last September went item by item and put our item on the table and went out and shopped the entire competitive market to make sure that it's -- at $1.25, it is still a great value. And our customers are telling us that in the results. So the 2,000 items are the ones that we thought we needed to invest more in and turn over and/or bring new that we had to discontinue over the last 18 months or just weren't a value anymore. So the 2,000 is what our goal was, and we're halfway through, 47%. The other half are going to flow through. And as they flow through, we're getting great results.\n But also remember, not -- and Kevin talked about it, it's a dynamic situation in market right now. So what we thought 6 months ago has changed already just because of the cost pressures we're seeing. So our Dollar Tree merchants know that at a fixed price point, they don't have to carry every item, and they drop the item and go get a replacement item and at the margin that we need. And our mix of items always changes out. That's the exciting thing about Dollar Tree. It's an extreme value and ever-exchanging meaningful assortment. And it's -- and the customers respond, and it's the thrill of the hunt. That's part of our mission at Dollar Tree. They're used to it. They've always done it at $1. Now they're just doing it at $1.25, and it's working very well. \nKevin Wampler: And Chuck, on your question about traffic. This quarter, in particular, is very affected by Easter. Easter was 2 weeks later. So you would have seen the best traffic in the third period and probably the biggest decrease in traffic more than likely in the second period because of the later Easter as well as when the stimulus dollars were released. So I think those are probably kind of the 2 factors. It's pretty lumpy because of those 2, but that's kind of the factors that are in play in Q1. \nMichael Witynski: One of the things that we're really seeing excitement around are our seasons are accelerating more than they used to at $1.25 and the meaningful assortment and then with our rollout of our $3 and $5 items that we're rolling out to another 1,500 stores this year. So the combination of the $1.25, $3 and $5 in our seasonal business has really given us a lift that we're excited about. And in quarter 2, if you think there's -- in quarter 1, Kevin talked about the great Easter and Valentine's, and we saw great response from the customers. Quarter 2 is summer, and you got Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. But the back half of the year is when back-to-school, Halloween and then Thanksgiving and Christmas that we're really setting ourselves up to have a great back half. \nCharles Grom: That's great. And just my follow-up would be historically speaking, you look back at other periods of consumer duress, and maybe Rick can opine on this question to a degree. I'm curious how long of a lag it was before you saw that middle-income customer begin to trade down and if you think this current macro environment is going to be different than what we saw over a decade ago. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. They're just -- it's a different pressure this year. But you're right, in 2008, '09 and '10, both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree saw an acceleration in their comp store sales. And there was just a slight drag, but they saw it a little bit in 2008 when it was happening and then '09, '10 and '11, it was sustained. It's hard to predict what's going to happen now just because it's -- there being pressure for different reasons. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll next go to Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Rick, great to hear your voice. First thing I wanted to ask is just about the $1.25 and the elasticity improving where you're adding value. Just more -- a little bit more detail on the number of categories you've done in terms of adding value back and what's left to do. And then how much bigger is the opportunity within discretionary in terms of like adding value or bringing items back? I mean it does seem like that would be the area where there's potentially a more powerful impact. \nMichael Witynski: Well, actually -- well, thanks for the question. Our discretionary, the value in our discretionary, our customer recognizes, and there wasn't a lot of rework that needed to happen there. And that's evident. That's why our discretionary business comped at 14%, and we really haven't touched it that much.\n Where we're focusing the 2,000 items are really concentrated mostly in consumable categories. So in the salty snack, in the carbonated beverage and in the food, that's where these categories we have 47% of the SKUs in. But really, we're going to add more in food. We're going to add more in carbonated beverage and more in salty snack to really drive that consumable. And it will take time. I -- we believe that's a traffic driver. And as the customers experience the items and appreciate the value we're giving them, over time, we believe that, that will help drive traffic into the overall store, not just those categories. \nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on $3 and $5, can you go faster? Why not go faster? The response seems to be good. Just updated thoughts there. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. It's a great question. We would go as fast as we can. We are going as fast as we can. If you remember last year -- it's really supply chain right now that's tempering our speed. Last year, we wanted to open up 500. And if you remember, the customers responding so well that we were selling through and the supply chain was slowing things down. So we slowed down our acceleration of rolling it out throughout the year, but we still ended up at 600 stores. So we're going to do -- we accelerate it to 1,500, and it's really depending on the supply chain because we're buying these products 9 to 12 months out.\n And it's -- we're excited about rolling this out. We're -- our expectations are to get this done as soon in the year as possible, and we're going to continue to roll that out. But we have every expectation to roll this $3 and $5 out throughout the entire network. And that's probably something that we can share at our October Analyst Day is what that -- what's that looking like. Because we really like it. We're putting this product in our stores. We're really seeing a benefit on the seasonal side of it. So our $3 and $5 items, combined with our great value at $1.25, is just lifting that entire seasonal sales in those respective stores. So we're going to keep enhancing the product. We're learning a lot, and it's going to be absolutely dedicated on the discretionary side of the store. \nOperator: We'll go next to Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. \nKelly Bania: Just wanted to just ask first about freight costs. There was a comment about maybe annualizing the increases from last year, and I think that's consistent with last quarter. So just curious if you can help us understand just how you view the state of the global shipping backdrop from your seat, what you're expecting from contract versus spot this year and just the overall cost for that. \nKevin Wampler: Yes. Kelly, this is Kevin. I'll start with some information on that. And really, in Q1, our freight was up, but it was very consistent with how we had forecasted it. And again, as we had talked about in March, we expected the first half of the year in particular to be affected by the annualization of the rates we saw in the last half of '21. So that feels like a good place to start.\n Obviously, diesel fuel has increased, and we've increased our forecast for the current market rates. And here is something to maybe give all of you kind of a metric to kind of think about diesel freight. So just a $1 change in rate for the year would be about a $63 million headwind. So that's the annualized number. And so you guys can do the math on what that means on a prorated basis. But that kind of gives you a feel for that. But we have the current market rates as we see it in our forecast and embedded in our guidance.\n In regards to ocean freight, the backlog is definitely significantly less than a year ago. It's not completely gone, but it's definitely better than it was. It's early. The contract carrier performance has been pretty much on plan at this point. We are still using chartered vessels, which has been successful and been helpful and continuing to move good. And the NVO rates have pretty much been in line with the way we have budgeted them at this point in time. So from our point of view, the way we came into the year looking at it, we're comfortable with where we're at. Obviously, it's -- the market can change rapidly, but we feel good about where we're at, at the moment. \nMichael Witynski: Yes. I would just add that from -- add on to what Kevin said, we've been battling this ocean freight for 2.5 years, and we felt it probably before anybody else did just because of our fixed price and the amount of containers we import. So this year, we've contracted slightly more than our needs. And it's because we're anticipating a continuation of some blank voyages that will continue to disrupt the supply chain. And as Kevin said, to fill our needs, we're using a combination of contracts, the NVO and our own dedicated charters. So -- and we've smoothed out our -- the purchasing of what we need. We've smoothed that out to be more consistent and dependable for the carrier. So we've gone into this year with 2.5 years of disruption experience. And as Kevin said, we're -- we think we have a good handle on the cost of it without unknowing any disruption that could happen going forward. \nKelly Bania: That's very, very helpful. And then maybe I'll just ask one more about Dollar Tree. As you merchandise against this new $1.25 price point, are you targeting that 36% gross margin today? Or do you maybe leave a little cushion for some higher costs in the future? And as well, do you consider testing even more price points, $1.50 or $2, just given how this is already going? \nMichael Witynski: Well, we have $1.25 fixed price point that we moved after 35 years, and then we've got the $3 and $5 price points that are fixed price points that we are rolling out as fast as we can over the next couple of years. So we feel really good that we can deliver an unbelievable assortment that is exciting and meaningful and an extreme value for our customers and still delivers on that thrill of the hunt. So we're excited about that. And we -- as you think about our comments about continuing to drive top line and bottom line performance, we will always keep in mind the margins needed to deliver those 2 things. \nOperator: All right. And that's all the time we have for questions at this time. So I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Randy Guiler for any additional or closing remarks. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you, Alan, and thank you all for joining us for today's call. Our next earnings conference call to discuss Q2 results is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 25, 2022. Thank you, and have a good day. \nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Michael Witynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. And it's good to have you here with us, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The team delivered a solid start to the year with a 6.5% top line sales expansion, a 19.2% lift to gross profit and a 48.1% increase to earnings per share. During the quarter, the Dollar Tree team successfully completed its conversion to the $1.25 price point, contributing to both sales and margin improvements. Shoppers are responding favorably as the new greater value products hit our shelves.\n Importantly, other key strategic initiatives, including the expansion of the $3 and $5 Plus assortment in our Dollar Tree stores, as well as our Combo Stores and H2 renovations at Family Dollar are all working. Rick outlined the types of additional strategic investments we will be making over the next several years that are designed to position the company for improved operating performance and long-term sustainable growth.\n Before I discuss Q1 performance by segment, I want to share a few details regarding a very eventful quarter for the company. In mid-March, our Board was reconstituted. We now have a new Executive Chair, a new Vice Chair and Lead Director -- Lead Independent Director and a total of 7 new directors. We also have 2 new Board committees, a Finance Committee and a Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee.\n This week, we published our new 2022 CSR report. I am proud of the progress we are making as a company and the team's effort on sustainability. Please check out the new CSR report in the Corporate Governance portion of our website at DollarTreeinfo.com.\n Rick and I have been working very closely together. We share a common vision for a long-term growth opportunity for the Dollar Tree organization. That value will be created by a combination of Dollar Tree's unique and resilient business model that is demonstrating its earnings power and momentum with its recent initiatives, along with a material improvement over time, and the operating performance of our Family Dollar banner. We are well underway with plans and priorities to address the performance at Family Dollar. I will share more detail later on this call.\n Also, 2 weeks ago, we announced the addition of 2 key executives to our leadership team. John Flanigan joined the company as Chief Supply Chain Officer. John brings decades of leadership experience in retail logistics, including grocery, drugstore and the value sectors. John will be extremely focused on elevating our supply chain capabilities through improved distribution operations, hiring and retaining of teams, the efficiency improvements throughout supply chain designed to drive greater store productivity through improved in-stock position. He plans to lead productivity improvements across the logistics function by the use of data analytics, process improvement and automation.\n Additionally, Larry Gatta has joined the team as Chief Merchandising Officer for the Family Dollar segment. Larry brings more than 35 years of retail merchandising and marketing experience. He is well known and respected throughout the vendor community and will be leading plans to drive our business, and in turn, the business of our supply partners. Larry will be focused on improving Family Dollar's operating performance and productivity through sales-driving initiatives that provide great value for our shoppers.\n In addition to the investments we are outlining today, components of our transformation were driven by a number of factors, including continuing to enhance our culture, elevated store standards, better use of private brands, improved category adjacencies, enhancing our product mix, optimizing our vendor partnerships and many, many more.\n To some degree today, and especially in the quarters ahead, you can expect to receive more details, improved transparency and greater management engagement in shareholder communications as we progress on our plans to improve the operating performance and reassess the long-term opportunities for the company. We are currently in the process of planning an Investor Day targeted for October time frame.\n Now to Q1 performance. The Dollar Tree banner delivered its strongest quarter in company history. Among the highlights: an 11.2% comp, the best quarterly comp performance in more than 20 years, which is including our largest sales day ever, which was the Saturday before Easter; a 40.6% gross profit margin, nearly 700 basis points above the prior year's quarter; and a company record 20.2% operating margin, more than 800 basis points over Q1 of last year.\n Margins in Q1 did receive an outsized temporary benefit from the initial transition to the new price point as well as selling through the current inventories. We are modeling a moderation of the margin level as we focus on providing our shoppers with new assortments at greater value for the $1.25 price point. The 11.2% comp sales increase was driven by a 15.4% increase in average ticket partially offset by a traffic decline of 3.6%. For the quarter, the discretionary side of the business delivered a strong 14.1% comp increase, while consumables increased 8%. April, which benefited from the later Easter holiday this year, was the strongest month in terms of both sales and traffic.\n Importantly, we successfully completed the conversion to a primary price point of $1.25 across the chain. Credit to our teams. This project was announced in September of 2021 and was completed by the end of February with minimal disruption. By the end of Q1, our customers have already seen more than 960 of our projected 2,000 new greater value product SKUs on the shelves. Our shoppers are responding to the new items. We are seeing much improved results in the categories since rolling out the enhanced offering.\n Examples of the consumables category comp improvements where we've put in these new items: carbonated beverage, from a 3% decline to a 12% increase now; in snacks and cookies, before the new SKUs, we had a decline of 8%, now a 12% increase in comp; and in our food category, from a 10% decline before to now experiencing a 2% increase. The majority of the changes at this early stage are now traffic-driving consumable side of the business. The discretionary changes will occur throughout the back half of the year.\n The $1.25 assortment changes are notable and easy to see when you visit Dollar Tree stores. In today's environment, where consumers are seeing higher prices everywhere, shoppers know they can rely on Dollar Tree as their destination for extreme value and evolving meaningful assortment and a thrill of the hunt.\n The Family Dollar banner had a big hurdle to climb in Q1. In 2020, Family Dollar had a 15.5% quarterly comp increase at the onset of COVID. And in last year's quarter, there was a record release of stimulus dollars that positively impacted both top line sales and margin with the lift in discretionary sales.\n For Q1, Family Dollar's comps declined 2.8%, which represents a nearly 10% comp since 2019. The 2.8% comp sales decrease was comprised of 3.7% decline in traffic partially offset by a 1% increase in average ticket. For the quarter, the consumable side of the business delivered a 1.2% comp increase, while discretionary comps were down 14.7% as we cycled the massive release of stimulus dollars last year. February represented the best comp month for the quarter, and April was slightly better than the quarter's comp.\n Importantly, Family Dollar's comp sales for the quarter were negatively impacted by an estimated 200 basis points by the temporary closures of approximately 400 Family Dollar stores served by our Arkansas distribution center. All of these stores have now reopened.\n Last week, we announced that we will be closing the 30-year-old West Memphis, Arkansas distribution center that we have deemed is no longer part of our go-forward strategy. We are working closely with the impacted associates to support them with their transitions by providing severance plans to those eligible, helping associates with opportunities in our other distribution centers and in our stores as well as providing outplacement services and employee assistant programs. We are reallocating stores to other DCs to fulfill the store deliveries and have sufficient capacity to serve all stores in our remaining fleet of distribution centers. We appreciate the hard work and support of West Memphis associates committed during the transition process.\n I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide more color on Q1 and our updated outlook. Thanks, Kevin. As Rick mentioned in the opening, we are committed to transform Dollar Tree from a good company to a great company. Our initiatives are working and providing increased profits and cash flow. Rick and I both believe now is the ideal time to accelerate investments focused on driving growth through improved associate and shopper experience while propelling greater efficiencies.\n These strategic initiatives will be designed to position Dollar Tree for long-term sustainable growth. And we are going to invest and incur costs associated with making this journey. It's the right thing to do, and this is the ideal time to invest in our future. Again, to reiterate, we will be investing in our associates and our stores, the DC network and supply chain, Family Dollar pricing and the value proposition and our technology.\n Both Rick and I are committed, aligned and extremely focused. The ability to execute our key strategic initiatives is paying off and setting a solid foundation for improved operating performance and accelerated growth. We believe an -- we delivered an EPS of $5.80 in fiscal 2021. And the midpoint of our guidance range this year is $8, representing a 38% increase. I believe we are at an inflection point to exhibit our earnings power into the years ahead.\n We are committed to meeting our customers' needs while investing in initiatives that are delivering the best returns. These initiatives, combined with our robust balance sheet, will position us to deliver long-term growth for our stakeholders, associates, customers, suppliers and our shareholders. We all know it is incredibly challenging and uncertain time for the businesses today.\n We believe our company offers the following as we manage through these times: stable and resilient business model that has worked at good times and in bad; a 16,000 store footprint that is convenient for shoppers buying their needs; a tremendous value assortment that helps shoppers stretch their budgets; a strong balance sheet that enables us to invest in our business while enhancing our ability to manage and maneuver through the current environment effectively; a road map to deliver shareholder value through improved performance at Family Dollar and improved supply chain and a continued momentum at Dollar Tree.\n We have a fantastic growth story of opening 590 new stores this year alone, driving top line sales growth through key initiatives and, again, an expected 38% year-over-year earnings growth at the midpoint of our range.\n Operator, Kevin and I are now ready to take questions. Yes. Matt, I just -- on the timing of our initiatives, you can -- the way we're thinking about it, the short to midterm, we'll be definitely investing in our associates in our stores. And we'll be working on that throughout the quarters. And that's embedded in the guidance that we gave as well as in our pricing. One of our key initiatives is to get sharper on our pricing and close that gap to our key competitors at Family Dollar. And Larry is working on that right now, and we'll be laying that plan in over the next several quarters.\n The longer-term things that Rick -- for our long-term growth is really leveraging and driving efficiencies in our supply chain. And John Flanigan actually is out in one of our DCs today, assessing those things. And then our IT, and we're looking at all of our systems, especially our supply chain, merchandising and storefront systems. So those are bigger capital items, but they're going to take time as we assess them. And I think over the next 2 to 3 years, you'll see those improvements come into the business. Yes. That's the exciting part of it. Our Dollar Tree has got such a great reputation for delivering extreme value, and customers have responded well. Our -- throughout the quarter, units were better. Unit decline was better than what we had planned and expected. Unit decline is around the 10-ish mark. Our -- and we shared our transactions are down a little bit more than 4%. Our average ticket is up 15%. So those all feel good for us. And going through the quarter, we're delivering almost half of the new items, and customers are responding very, very favorably.\n And we did -- so the metrics, they're telling us the customers responded. In those categories that we shared, we're seeing -- the last 18 months prior to this change, we were seeing declines in the consumables side and declines in our traffic because of that. But now we reversed in our salty snacks, in our cookies and in our food.\n And also externally, we've done some more extensive research of a second round in the quarter. And customers are highly likely to continue shopping at Dollar Tree after the price change. 85% expressed strong likelihood to shop, 77% are recommending our stores. So our customers still appreciate that great find, the extreme value and the meaningful assortment for them.\n So we feel good about where we're at right now and as we're moving forward. We've only got one quarter under our belt and looking downstream, we're excited about the new assortment coming in. And this is going to take a while for us to really reset our assortment and our level of margin as we cycle through the new items coming in then, of course, add it to our import items. That will really take throughout the next year as we're incorporating those into our import buys. Well, on the Dollar Tree side, as I've said, we've got a lot of momentum because we've been working on this for quite a while. In fact, in the last 2 years, what I'm excited about is during the 2.5 years of COVID and supply chain disruption, we've come out of this and with 2 formats that we didn't have in 2019. We've got a great Combo Store and we broke the $1 to $1.25, and we were enhancing that with $3 and $5 assortments. So we've got some momentum, and our strategies are working. And our cash flow is strong. We've got a great balance sheet. We've got a new reconstituted Board and with Rick on board and including the new talent that we talked about. So we're in a place where we're coming out of, I believe, the era of COVID with great momentum in our strategies, a great balance sheet, a new Board. And we're going to accelerate our growth. So we're not starting today. We're really going to accelerate this going forward.\n So I think on -- as the investments, we will get more detail as we continue to work through this. And that's where we said we're going to have our first Analyst Day in October that we'll be really getting into the more of the nuts and bolts of when to expect as we look at this over the next quarters and years on how we lay that in and the benefit according to -- that goes along with those investments. No, not right now. We've got everything embedded in our outlook for this year. And then we're working really hard. Both Larry and John are looking at those items as we think about how do the beyond years look, and we'll be sharing that in the future. Absolutely. Yes. I'll throw it to Kevin for a little bit of color. But the way I think about it, yes, we are investing. But also, we're delivering earnings EPS growth throughout the time and top line growth. So as Rick and I said, the things that we are investing, they will have a return for long-term sustainable growth. And if you look at our EPS from the midpoint range up, it's a 40% -- just under a 40% increase in EPS, and we moved our top line up. So yes, we'll be investing in the future, but we're going to be investing with the thought of continuing to drive that top line and the bottom line at the same time. Yes. And I would just close with our balance sheet and cash flow enables us to do this. We can invest to keep growing our store count to be a growth company. We can invest in the key enablers and supply chain and IT. And we can buy back shares to grow our share. So we've got options going forward. It's not just simply investing in expenses. Yes, we do. Yes. And that's important. We've got to be meaningful to our customers first and foremost, and that's what we're going to focus on. And on the other side, we've got Larry here who works very closely with the vendor manufacturers, and we will balance it, right? We'll make good decisions to invest where we need to, to meet the customers' needs in the marketplace. We're just going to simply close the gap to where we are on our KVIs, our key value items, and then just make sure the entire shopping experience is at a great value for our customer. And it's a balance. Well, the 2,000 were the amount that we needed to change. Remember, at last earnings call, our merchants since last September went item by item and put our item on the table and went out and shopped the entire competitive market to make sure that it's -- at $1.25, it is still a great value. And our customers are telling us that in the results. So the 2,000 items are the ones that we thought we needed to invest more in and turn over and/or bring new that we had to discontinue over the last 18 months or just weren't a value anymore. So the 2,000 is what our goal was, and we're halfway through, 47%. The other half are going to flow through. And as they flow through, we're getting great results.\n But also remember, not -- and Kevin talked about it, it's a dynamic situation in market right now. So what we thought 6 months ago has changed already just because of the cost pressures we're seeing. So our Dollar Tree merchants know that at a fixed price point, they don't have to carry every item, and they drop the item and go get a replacement item and at the margin that we need. And our mix of items always changes out. That's the exciting thing about Dollar Tree. It's an extreme value and ever-exchanging meaningful assortment. And it's -- and the customers respond, and it's the thrill of the hunt. That's part of our mission at Dollar Tree. They're used to it. They've always done it at $1. Now they're just doing it at $1.25, and it's working very well. One of the things that we're really seeing excitement around are our seasons are accelerating more than they used to at $1.25 and the meaningful assortment and then with our rollout of our $3 and $5 items that we're rolling out to another 1,500 stores this year. So the combination of the $1.25, $3 and $5 in our seasonal business has really given us a lift that we're excited about. And in quarter 2, if you think there's -- in quarter 1, Kevin talked about the great Easter and Valentine's, and we saw great response from the customers. Quarter 2 is summer, and you got Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. But the back half of the year is when back-to-school, Halloween and then Thanksgiving and Christmas that we're really setting ourselves up to have a great back half. Yes. They're just -- it's a different pressure this year. But you're right, in 2008, '09 and '10, both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree saw an acceleration in their comp store sales. And there was just a slight drag, but they saw it a little bit in 2008 when it was happening and then '09, '10 and '11, it was sustained. It's hard to predict what's going to happen now just because it's -- there being pressure for different reasons. Well, actually -- well, thanks for the question. Our discretionary, the value in our discretionary, our customer recognizes, and there wasn't a lot of rework that needed to happen there. And that's evident. That's why our discretionary business comped at 14%, and we really haven't touched it that much.\n Where we're focusing the 2,000 items are really concentrated mostly in consumable categories. So in the salty snack, in the carbonated beverage and in the food, that's where these categories we have 47% of the SKUs in. But really, we're going to add more in food. We're going to add more in carbonated beverage and more in salty snack to really drive that consumable. And it will take time. I -- we believe that's a traffic driver. And as the customers experience the items and appreciate the value we're giving them, over time, we believe that, that will help drive traffic into the overall store, not just those categories. Yes. It's a great question. We would go as fast as we can. We are going as fast as we can. If you remember last year -- it's really supply chain right now that's tempering our speed. Last year, we wanted to open up 500. And if you remember, the customers responding so well that we were selling through and the supply chain was slowing things down. So we slowed down our acceleration of rolling it out throughout the year, but we still ended up at 600 stores. So we're going to do -- we accelerate it to 1,500, and it's really depending on the supply chain because we're buying these products 9 to 12 months out.\n And it's -- we're excited about rolling this out. We're -- our expectations are to get this done as soon in the year as possible, and we're going to continue to roll that out. But we have every expectation to roll this $3 and $5 out throughout the entire network. And that's probably something that we can share at our October Analyst Day is what that -- what's that looking like. Because we really like it. We're putting this product in our stores. We're really seeing a benefit on the seasonal side of it. So our $3 and $5 items, combined with our great value at $1.25, is just lifting that entire seasonal sales in those respective stores. So we're going to keep enhancing the product. We're learning a lot, and it's going to be absolutely dedicated on the discretionary side of the store. Yes. I would just add that from -- add on to what Kevin said, we've been battling this ocean freight for 2.5 years, and we felt it probably before anybody else did just because of our fixed price and the amount of containers we import. So this year, we've contracted slightly more than our needs. And it's because we're anticipating a continuation of some blank voyages that will continue to disrupt the supply chain. And as Kevin said, to fill our needs, we're using a combination of contracts, the NVO and our own dedicated charters. So -- and we've smoothed out our -- the purchasing of what we need. We've smoothed that out to be more consistent and dependable for the carrier. So we've gone into this year with 2.5 years of disruption experience. And as Kevin said, we're -- we think we have a good handle on the cost of it without unknowing any disruption that could happen going forward. Well, we have $1.25 fixed price point that we moved after 35 years, and then we've got the $3 and $5 price points that are fixed price points that we are rolling out as fast as we can over the next couple of years. So we feel really good that we can deliver an unbelievable assortment that is exciting and meaningful and an extreme value for our customers and still delivers on that thrill of the hunt. So we're excited about that. And we -- as you think about our comments about continuing to drive top line and bottom line performance, we will always keep in mind the margins needed to deliver those 2 things."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 6.5% to $6.9 billion comprised of $3.78 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.12 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.4% despite cycling the large outflow of stimulus from the prior year's quarter. This represented a 190 basis point sequential improvement from Q4.\n Costs for the Dollar Tree segment increased 11.2%. Family Dollar same-store sales decreased 2.8%. And on a 3-year stack basis, Dollar Tree is at a 15% comp, and Family Dollar is at a 9.9% comp. Gross profit improved 19.2% to $2.34 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 33.9% compared to 30.3% in the prior year's quarter.\n Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 690 basis points to 40.6% compared to 33.7% for the same period last year as a result of the net of the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 590 basis points, primarily due to increased initial mark-on and increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise, partially offset by higher freight costs. Occupancy costs decreased 80 basis points from leverage on the comp sales increase. Distribution costs decreased 50 basis points from leverage and higher capitalized balances resulting from inventory increases in the current quarter partially offset by higher hourly wages. And markdown costs increased 30 basis points primarily from markdowns for clearance items as we move to a higher value assortment at the $1.25 price point.\n Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased 100 basis points to 25.8% compared to 26.8% for the same period last year. Markdown costs increased 75 basis points due to higher clearance activity related to the shipping delays for seasonal items and slow-moving merchandise. Occupancy costs increased 45 basis points from deleverage from the comparable store sales decrease and higher real estate taxes.\n Shrink increased 25 basis points for more favorable inventory results in relation to accruals in the prior year's quarter. These increases were partially offset by distribution costs that decreased 15 basis points, primarily from higher capitalized balances from inventory increases, partially offset by our higher hourly wages. And merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 35 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise.\n Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 100 basis points to 23.3% compared to 22.3% in Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment improved 120 basis points to 20.4% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 100 basis points from leverage on the 11.2% comp partially offset by hourly wages and investments in store payroll.\n Facility costs improved 25 basis points from leverage. Depreciation costs decreased approximately 10 basis points, partially offset by other SG&A, which increased approximately 15 basis points resulting from higher store supply costs.\n For the Family Dollar segment, the first quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue increased 280 basis points to 23% compared to 20.2% in the prior year's quarter. Payroll expenses increased 90 basis points primarily due to hourly wage and investment in store payroll as well as deleverage on the comp sales decline.\n Other SG&A expenses increased 85 basis points due to asset impairment for the West Memphis DC, along with higher store supply expenses for store projects and higher legal fees. Store facility costs increased 65 basis points primarily from costs associated with removal of product from stores in connection with the voluntary product recall as well as deleverage on the comp decline. And depreciation and amortization increased 40 basis points due to increased depreciation related to capital expenditures for store renovations and improvements.\n Corporate, support and Other expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 1.8% compared to the prior year quarter of 1.4%. The higher costs related to increased legal fees, including the reconstitution of our Board, and incentive compensation.\n Operating income improved 40.7% to $731.5 million or 10.6% of total revenue in the first quarter. Nonoperating expenses totaled $34 million comprised of net interest expense, and the effective tax rate was 23.1% for both the current and prior year's quarter. Net income for the quarter improved 43.2% to $536.4 million or $2.30 per diluted share, which includes $0.13 per share for costs related to the West Memphis DC. This compared to net earnings of $374.5 million or $1.60 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.\n Looking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.22 billion compared to $985 million at the end of fiscal 2021. Outstanding debt as of April 30 were $3.45 billion. The company repurchased approximately 90,000 shares in Q1 for approximately $14.2 million under the share repurchase authorization.\n Compared to last year, inventory levels at Dollar Tree are up 39% due to increased capitalized freight costs plus Dollar Tree Plus inventory and a catch-up in past due inventories. Inventory levels at Family Dollar increased 27% compared to [indiscernible] last year due to increased capitalized freight and an increase in the average unit cost. Both banners have less average inventory units in store than at the same period in 2019 pre-pandemic.\n Capital expenditures were $253.4 million in the first quarter versus $224.9 million in Q1 of last year. And for fiscal 2022, we currently expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately [indiscernible], slightly higher than our initial outlook for the year based on additional supply chain projects and construction cost pressures.\n Depreciation and amortization totaled $188.9 million for Q1 compared to $172.7 million in the first quarter of the last year. And for fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million.\n In March, our initial outlook for fiscal 2022, diluted EPS was a range of $7.60 to $8. We expect to incur costs totaling an estimated $0.43 per share, which were not included in our original outlook. These costs represent: in Q1, $0.13 per share for asset impairment and the product recall costs related to our West Memphis DC; for Q2, an estimated $0.22 per share for lost sales, freight, merchandise disposal, payroll and legal costs associated with the West Memphis matter; and for full year fiscal 2022, a total of $0.08 per share for stock compensation expense related to an option grant issued to our new Executive Chairman.\n Diluted earnings per share for the full year is now expected to range from $7.80 to $8.20, which includes the $0.43 of costs I've just outlined. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $27.76 billion to $28.14 billion compared to our previous range of $27.22 billion to $27.85 billion. We expect to deliver a mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a more or less flat comparable store sales in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 3.9%. \n For Q2, we estimate consolidated net sales to range from $6.65 billion to $6.78 billion based on a low to mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, and this estimate includes approximately $0.24 per share for costs for the West Memphis matter and stock compensation expense.\n Considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following. We anticipate that we will continue to experience uncertainty related to inflation, the global supply chain and geopolitical factors. For example, we have seen diesel costs continue to rise, and natural gas price increases are affecting utility costs throughout the business. We are once again experiencing shortages in the availability of helium and have not been able to procure the volume [ to fulfill our ] needs, which will negatively affect balloon sales. Our outlook includes our best current estimates of pressures from these factors.\n We cycled the third round of stimulus checks that totaled an estimated $386 billion in March of 2021. In Q2, we will begin cycling the monthly advance Child Tax Credit payments that began in mid-July of 2021.\n We noted that our original outlook in March that we expected to invest $195 million in store and DC associate wages in 2022. As an update, given the competitive retail environment, we expect that we will likely exceed this amount as we invest in our associates.\n Import domestic freight will present cost pressures due to annualization of fiscal '21 rates in the first half of 2022. As noted in March, we plan for diesel fuel prices to be higher this year. We have increased the forecasted amount for the remainder of the year based on the current market. Additional color for the year regarding our expectations include, for the enterprise, we are forecasting improved operating margin for the business driven by gross margin improvements, partially offset by higher SG&A costs as a percentage of total revenue.\n The Dollar Tree segment gross margin in Q1 included an outsized benefit from the transition to the new $1.25 price point. We expect to see a gross margin moderation from the Q1 level as new greater value assortments are incorporated into the business. The Dollar Tree segment is expected to deliver improved operating margin for the year with gross margin benefiting from its strategic initiatives as well as leverage on SG&A.\n The Family Dollar segment gross and operating margins are expected to be lower year-over-year, impacted by the following: higher costs, including freight and needed investments in the business such as labor and improved store conditions; the impact to product mix as a result of stimulus dollars driving discretionary sales in the prior year; and the impact on sales and expenses related to the West Memphis DC matter.\n Net interest expense is expected to be approximately [indiscernible] in Q2 and $123 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.2% for the second quarter and 24% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share count are assumed to be 226.4 million shares for Q2 and 226.5 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchase. And as of April 30, we had $2.5 billion remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.\n I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. Rupesh, this is Kevin. As we think through this, and obviously, to Mike's point, we're one quarter in, we're still learning a lot as we work through this. There'll be -- so moving pieces as always. The marketplace continues to move as to what investment into the product is going to be necessary to be a value in the marketplace. I would tell you this year, I think at a minimum, we would hope to be to the higher end of that historical range. And if we can be above it, we'll be above it. I don't know that we -- where that will exactly land.\n Again, the environment is such that there's enough uncertainty that it's pretty hard to peg given the fact that the newness of the $1.25 price point and some of the things that are going on, on a macro level out there. But it will be a positive in a big way for the overall company. The other thing I would say, Karen, as Mike mentioned in his early comments, we do have a new Finance Committee. This committee obviously will be very focused on return on invested capital as we think about things. There are some things we have to do because we need to do it, which is -- you can look at our store standards. We want to make sure we have stores that are -- keep the standards that we expect and our customers deserve. So those are investments you make. But if you look, a lot of this is capital investment in systems and in our supply chain that, again, it's about productivity and efficiency and making it easier at the store level for that store manager and the assistant manager and that team there that's working very hard every day. So our job at the end is to make their job easier. And that's where these investments will -- may have a big payoff at the end of the day. And Chuck, on your question about traffic. This quarter, in particular, is very affected by Easter. Easter was 2 weeks later. So you would have seen the best traffic in the third period and probably the biggest decrease in traffic more than likely in the second period because of the later Easter as well as when the stimulus dollars were released. So I think those are probably kind of the 2 factors. It's pretty lumpy because of those 2, but that's kind of the factors that are in play in Q1. Yes. Kelly, this is Kevin. I'll start with some information on that. And really, in Q1, our freight was up, but it was very consistent with how we had forecasted it. And again, as we had talked about in March, we expected the first half of the year in particular to be affected by the annualization of the rates we saw in the last half of '21. So that feels like a good place to start.\n Obviously, diesel fuel has increased, and we've increased our forecast for the current market rates. And here is something to maybe give all of you kind of a metric to kind of think about diesel freight. So just a $1 change in rate for the year would be about a $63 million headwind. So that's the annualized number. And so you guys can do the math on what that means on a prorated basis. But that kind of gives you a feel for that. But we have the current market rates as we see it in our forecast and embedded in our guidance.\n In regards to ocean freight, the backlog is definitely significantly less than a year ago. It's not completely gone, but it's definitely better than it was. It's early. The contract carrier performance has been pretty much on plan at this point. We are still using chartered vessels, which has been successful and been helpful and continuing to move good. And the NVO rates have pretty much been in line with the way we have budgeted them at this point in time. So from our point of view, the way we came into the year looking at it, we're comfortable with where we're at. Obviously, it's -- the market can change rapidly, but we feel good about where we're at, at the moment."

            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. It's been an extremely busy 10 weeks since joining the Dollar Tree team. I've been actively meeting with the leaders throughout the organization to get to know them and their businesses and to discuss priorities and opportunities. We see a massive opportunity ahead of us to drive long-term sustainable value creation through the combined Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands. It's abundantly clear to us that to deliver this long-term opportunity, we're going to be going from a great company and that change is needed.\n We are fully committed to transform Dollar Tree from a good company today to a great company tomorrow. We have this unique opportunity to become a growth engine that delivers profitable growth with attractive returns on capital for many years to come. However, to get from here to there, we must build the foundation to fuel this engine. We need to invest in the areas that most positively impact the associate and shopper experience. These investments are intended to greatly improve the performance of the Family Dollar segment and our supply chain as well as support the continued momentum at Dollar Tree.\n We'll be focusing on our people, most importantly, our teams from store and distribution center associates to field leadership through competitive wages, improved store and DC conditions and enhanced safety. The distribution center network and supply chain presents us with a golden opportunity to amplify efficiencies and deliver greater support to our stores and elevated service to our shoppers through improved in-stock positions.\n Pricing at Family Dollar and the value proposition at both banners, we need to be right on price at Family Dollar, on par with our primary competitors, and we will work directly with our suppliers to drive greater store productivity. Dollar Tree has a long history of exceeding customer expectations by offering extreme value. We will continue to place a great emphasis on the value proposition at Dollar Tree.\n And finally, technology. We are simply not where we need to be from a systems perspective to reach our potential. We have recently begun a comprehensive review of all of our systems and infrastructure to make the right decisions and investments to take Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to the next level.\n I felt great about the long-term opportunity for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar before I got here. Now that I've been inside the organization for 2 months, I feel better than ever. I have full confidence in the team and our Board of Directors as we embark on this much needed transformational growth journey. The Dollar Tree banner is generating renewed momentum, and we will be taking the necessary steps to enable Family Dollar to seize the opportunity to deliver long-term operating performance improvements.\n We are in the midst of a very challenging time for consumers as many are living paycheck to paycheck. They are facing the highest inflation since the early 1980s, record high gas prices, the effects from the pandemic, geopolitical uncertainty and much more. In tough times, value retail can be part of the solution to help families stretch their dollars to meet their evolving needs. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar provide convenience as our 16,000-plus stores are located close to millions of households to live and work.\n Mike and I view our organization as a growth company. Now is the ideal time to shift gears for us to make change happen to unlock shareholder value and enable the next wave of profitable growth for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.\n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Thanks, Matt. Yes, Matt. I'll throw a little color out here and then turn it over to Mike. We are really taking a good hard look at the entire organization. We're looking at both banners. And the goal here is sustainable long-term growth. And we've got a very good team here, a lot of really solid people, and we're going to supplement them with incremental people that, quite frankly, I've been involved with in my career.\n But the -- as I reflect on this, you have 2 great banners. Dollar Tree is incredibly exciting and fascinating to me. It's the true treasure hunt. The work that's been done on expanding multiple price points, I think, has been great. And now what we have to do is focus on the fundamentals of consumable retailing in Family Dollar. And Mike, what would you like to add to that?"

[Operator Instructions]\n At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob LaFleur, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRobert LaFleur: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Dollar Tree's fourth quarter results.

Please note that a supplemental slide deck outlining selected operating metrics is available on the IR section of our website.  \n Following our prepared remarks, Rick and Jeff will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. This past year, our organization made meaningful progress in the ongoing transformation of our core business, which includes building a foundation for sustainable growth. While I have been Chairman and CEO for a year now, we are still in the early stages of this transformation journey. We're off to a good start and we remain focused, and we are excited about the remaining transformation work that lies ahead of us. \n You've heard me say that sales per square foot, transactions and units are among the most important benchmarks in retail. I am pleased to report that we are seeing growth across all three, and momentum is building across the business. We are making progress on the operational objectives of our transformation. And in some areas, we are seeing positive results earlier than we expected. While the transformation process is dynamic, we remain focused on delivering against our core growth objectives and as always, navigating through the challenges we encounter along the way. \n As I previewed on our last call, we are also taking decisive steps to strengthen the Family Dollar brand and better position it to achieve its full potential. We took a thoughtful and deliberate approach to address underperforming stores by considering each individual store's performance, local operating environment, and our broader need for scale and operating efficiencies across the portfolio. As part of the portfolio review process, we have identified approximately 600 Family Dollar stores that we will close in the first half of fiscal 2024. Additionally, approximately 370 more Family Dollar, and 30 Dollar Tree stores will close at the end of each store's current lease term. \n We believe rationalizing these unprofitable locations will help to unlock meaningful value at the enterprise level. Collectively, we estimate that net sales loss from the stores we intend to close this year is approximately $730 million on an annual run rate basis. On the other hand, given their historical underperformance, we would get back approximately $0.30 of annual run rate EPS net of any stranded costs.\n Now, let me shift gears and discuss our fourth quarter results. On a consolidated basis, net sales increased 12% to $8.6 billion, including a $560 million benefit from this year's 53rd week. Enterprise comp grew by 3% with 4.6% higher traffic, offsetting a 1.5% lower ticket. Adjusted operating income increased by 21% to $749 million. Adjusted EPS grew 25% to $2.55. \n While our quarter 4 reported EPS on an adjusted basis was below our quarter 4 outlook, these results include $0.17 of net costs, primarily related to actuarial insurance adjustments that were not contemplated in our outlook. Jeff will provide more detail on this in his remarks, but without these unanticipated costs, quarter 4 operating results exceeded our expectations.\n Looking at performance by banner. Dollar Tree segment comps were up 6.3% on 7.1% more traffic, and a 0.7% decrease in ticket. Traffic and ticket both improved sequentially. This strong quarter 4 comp came on top of an 8.7% comp last year. Dollar Tree's consumable comp was up 10.8%, and its discretionary comp was up 3.1%, a 200 basis point sequential increase from quarter 3 and an impressive accomplishment given the general weakness in discretionary demand across retail. The quarter's consumable comp came on top of a 9% comp last year. As pleased as we are with Dollar Tree's quarter 4 performance, it's worth noting that we believe January's winter storms negatively impacted comp by about 70 basis points. \n In quarter 4, Dollar Tree continued to take unit market share in consumables. According to Nielsen, our unit volume grew 8%, while the market declined 1.5%. These strong gains in traffic and market share are supported by Dollar Tree's ability to attract new and higher income customers. \n Continuing recent trends, Dollar Tree added 3.4 million new customers in 2023, mostly from households earning over $125,000 a year. We attribute Dollar Tree's exceptional performance to the range of initiatives we have been implementing. \n One of the most important initiatives at Dollar Tree is our multi-price point strategy, which we're calling More Choices. The underlying premise here is that we can present a more relevant assortment to our customers if we are free to offer items at a variety of price points. Here, we are making tremendous progress. We have substantially completed the rollout of $3, $4, and $5 frozen and refrigerated items, which are now available in more than 6,500 stores. Today, we typically offer multi-price frozen product in 3 coolers within our usual 10-cooler bank. Over time, that will evolve to 8 out of 10 as we expand the assortment.\n By the end of 2023, we introduced $3 and $5 center store merchandise to approximately 5,000 Dollar Tree stores, and expect to add another 2,000 stores this year. We are especially excited about the next phase of our multi-price expansion strategy. Dollar Tree's Chief Merchandising Officer, Rick McNeely and his team, are continuously working on new ways to deliver value while expanding our assortment across a wider range of price points. This expanded assortment will offer Dollar Tree shoppers a wider range of choices across a variety of categories, including food and snacks, beverages, pet care, personal care and more. \n This year, across 3,000 stores, we expect to expand our multi-price assortment by over 300 items at price points ranging from $1.50 to $7. But even as our multi-price assortment expands over time, the vast majority of the items sold in Dollar Tree stores will remain at our entry-level fixed price point. Over time, you will also see us fully integrate multi-price merchandise more into our stores so our shoppers will find $5 bags of dog food next to our traditional $1.25 pet treats and toys, and our $3 bags of candy will be found in the candy aisle. This is the next exciting chapter of the Dollar Tree value story, new items, more choices and more savings. \n Now let's turn to Family Dollar. Here, persistent inflation and reduced government benefits continue to pressure the lower income consumers that comprise a sizable portion of Family Dollar's customer base. Accordingly, Family Dollar's quarter 4 comp declined 1.2% as a 0.7% traffic increase was more than offset by 2% ticket decline. Family Dollar's consumables comp decelerated sequentially to 2.2% in quarter 4 from 6.2% in quarter 3. Discretionary comp was down a full 12%. As challenging as this was, it was a slight sequential improvement over quarter 3. Categories like apparel, home decor, electronics and general merchandise remain weak as lower income consumers continue to be very deliberate about their spending. \n Family Dollar continued to take unit and dollar market share in consumables even as lower income consumers struggle with reduced SNAP benefits and other macro pressures. In fact, we estimate the reduced SNAP payments for total quarter 4 comps by about 5 points, and when coupled with the weak discretionary demand, the comp impact was closer to 7 points. Looking forward, we expect reduced SNAP benefits will be a headwind through at least the first half of FY '24 before comparisons ease. \n While the operating environment remains difficult, I don't believe the challenges we face are structural, and I continue to believe that a well-run and well-located Family Dollar store is a powerful retail force. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking aggressive actions to address underperforming stores.\n Looking through the transient factors that weighed on comps throughout 2023, I am encouraged by the fact that in a more normalized operating environment, our comps would have been higher. We believe our ongoing market share gains are a strong validation of the many initiatives we have underway. We are gaining traction in the vast majority of stores where they've been implemented, and I continue to believe that the Family Dollar banner is well positioned for long-term improvement as we continue to focus on operational excellence and financial performance. \n Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to update you on some of the key milestones we have achieved so far in our transformation journey. In real estate, we opened 641 new stores last year, which was at the high end of our target of 600 to 650. Selling square footage increased 3.6%, which was ahead of target. We are placing a greater emphasis on Dollar Tree openings given the attractive returns and performance, and we expect the vast majority of our new store openings in fiscal 2024 will be Dollar Trees. I'm excited about the overall quality of our project pipeline for both banners. \n In supply chain, our DC in Matthews, North Carolina is now providing roto cart deliveries to approximately 600 Family Dollar stores, and we are also testing roto carts deliveries to Dollar Tree stores from our DC here in Chesapeake. By the end of this year, over 3,000 stores should be receiving roto cart deliveries from a total of 6 DCs, 4 for Dollar Tree, and 2 for Family Dollar. As expected, we are already seeing a meaningful reduction in unloading times at stores using roto carts, and we expect those efficiencies will continue to build. \n Expanding and modernizing our trailer fleet is an important part of the roto cart initiative. To this end, we added nearly 900 new trailers with lift gates to the fleet in 2023, and expect to add 2,000 more this coming year. By the end of 2023, 9 of our DCs were temperature controlled. By the end of this year, all 25 of our DCs should be either fully temperature-controlled or have dedicated temperature-controlled facilities on site. \n Temperature-controlled DCs help reduce cross-stocking costs and allow us to carry OTC and other temperature-sensitive products throughout our distribution network. They also increase productivity by providing associates with a safer and more comfortable working environment.\n And finally, we continue to make progress on our completely revamped Family Dollar DC in West Memphis, which should improve the overall efficiency of our distribution network. As you probably saw in the news last month, Family Dollar reached a resolution with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its West Memphis DC, and we are pleased to have this situation behind us. As part of our ongoing transformation efforts, we continue to strengthen and enhance our food and product safety protocols and our compliance oversight. \n In our IT modernization, our new warehouse management system is up and running at its first DC. Concurrent with this rollout, we are also deploying and integrating our new transportation management and labor management system. Over time, we expect these enterprise-wide solutions to contribute to the optimization of our distribution network and labor efficiency. We have also installed new network infrastructure in over 3,800 stores, bringing improved Internet connectivity, security and in-store WiFi access to better support store operations.\n Since our last report, we have also begun implementation work on both our new enterprise-wide POS solution and our new human capital and payroll management system. We have also launched new mobile apps for both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. The Family Dollar app allows us to offer more targeted promotions and a better customer experience. The Dollar Tree app gives shoppers the ability to see new products, view weekly ads, receive notifications about great deals and do price checks.\n In private brands, we launched approximately 250 new SKUs, and converted over 300 control brands to private brands. The private brand program is one of the most significant initiatives underway at Family Dollar. And I'm excited that we now have a highly competitive offering that expands our assortment across multiple categories and offers the Family Dollar consumer national brand equivalent products at compelling values. By the end of last year, our private brand penetration reached 15%, 100 basis points ahead of our target, and a great head start towards reaching our 20% goal by 2026.\n On category resets, I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize Family Dollar's Chief Merchandising Officer, Larry Gatta and his team for their efforts to expand and improve our merchandising assortment. By the end of 2023, we successfully raised the merchandise height profile to 78 inches across the banner, and optimize our assortment with the addition of approximately 900 net new SKUs. \n These efforts are already having a meaningful impact on our results, adding 130 basis points to our quarter 4 comp, which helped offset at least some of the impact from the softer macro environment and comparatively weaker discretionary demand. This reset was a major undertaking for Larry's team, and our new planograms will allow us to expand and improve our product assortment and help Family Dollar gain additional market share. \n We are also moving forward with our goal of increasing the number of cooler doors in Family Dollar stores. We added over 17,000 cooler doors last year, which was 1,000 doors above our target, and brought our average across the Family Dollar segment to 26 coolers per store, which is approaching our goal of 30 coolers per store.  \n In summary, we continue to execute well around factors that we can control. I've said before that our progress on this journey will include challenges with the belief that we will succeed more often than not in our efforts, but the direction and destination remain clear, which is the long-term health and success of our business for the benefit of our customers, associates, stakeholders and partners.  \n Our growth initiatives are central to this journey and we are focused on continually improving, even in the face of a rapidly evolving macro landscape. We have an outstanding team with a cultural foundation focused on service to the customer and improving our performance each and every day. We remain relentlessly focused on retail fundamentals and continue to take market share. \n While challenges and macroeconomic factors will always be part of any retail journey, we continue to face them head on as they arise. We're excited about where we are and optimistic about where we are headed. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffrey Davis: Thank you, Rick, and good morning. I will first discuss our fourth quarter results. After which, I'll provide some details on the financial impact of the portfolio optimization, and close with our fiscal 2024 and Q1 outlook. \n As I discuss our fourth quarter results, where applicable, I will focus on our non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is provided in our earnings release. Also, as a reminder, our Q4 and full year 2023 results include an extra week of operations, which gave us an incremental $560 million in revenue and $0.35 of EPS for the quarter and the year. \n In the fourth quarter, the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments increased traffic, unit volume and market share despite persistent headwinds from an unfavorable sales mix and reduced SNAP benefits. Looking at the business on a consolidated basis, net sales increased 12% to $8.6 billion. Adjusted operating income was $749 million, a 21% increase from last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points, driven by a 220 basis point increase in adjusted gross margin, and offset by a 150 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. \n Adjusted gross profit increased 20% to $2.9 billion. Adjusted gross margin improvement was driven primarily by lower freight costs, occupancy cost leverage from the extra week, and higher vendor allowances, partially offset by product cost inflation, unfavorable sales mix and elevated shrink.\n Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily from ongoing labor investments, higher incentive compensation, unfavorable general liability claim development and depreciation, partially offset by leverage from additional sales from the extra week. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 23.4%. Adjusted net income was $556 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.55, which includes the $0.17 per share negative impact, primarily from unfavorable general liability insurance claims. \n Before I move on to segment level results, let me spend a moment to walk you through the non-GAAP adjustments in our Q4 results and shed some additional light on the $0.17 per share negative impact, primarily from unfavorable general liability insurance claims. \n The first non-GAAP adjustment was related to the portfolio review process. Here, we incurred total noncash charges of  $594 million, including $86 million for inventory markdowns and $504 million for store asset impairments. We also incurred an additional $4 million of related fees. The second non-GAAP adjustment was a noncash impairment charge of $2 billion for Family Dollar, including $1.1 billion related to goodwill, and $950 million related to the trade name. The third non-GAAP adjustment was a $27 million charge within SG&A related to the resolution we reached with the Department of Justice regarding our West Memphis distribution center. This was in addition to the $30 million West Memphis reserve we recorded in Q1. \n Outside of the non-GAAP adjustments, Q4 results included $0.17 of net EPS headwinds related to items that weren't contemplated in our Q4 outlook. These items include negative adjustments to our general liability accruals, which were partially offset by favorable adjustments to workers' compensation liabilities and the elimination of certain rent and depreciation expenses as part of our Family Dollar impairment process. Adjustments to general liability accruals may sound familiar to many of you as we absorbed $0.07 of EPS impact from this issue in the second quarter of 2023. So let me explain why we are revisiting this in Q4. \n In the process of accruing for potential general liability exposure, predicting the outcome of both existing and unreported claims is inherently complex. We rely on third-party actuarial analysis to estimate insurance reserves on an ongoing basis. As we discussed in our second quarter call, general liability claims have been more volatile in recent years. Since the pandemic, the development of claims has worsened. The charge taken this quarter intends to capture this new environment.  \n To address this over the long term, we have upgraded our risk management capabilities and revised our processes to focus on claim closures, among other areas. As we continue to address all open claims with our new processes, our actuarial studies should reflect more normalized risk exposure over time.  \n Now back to our business segment results. Dollar Tree's net sales increased by 16% to $5 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 21% to $873 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points, driven by a 230 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by a 150 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin improved primarily from lower domestic and import freight costs and favorable occupancy cost leverage due to the 53rd week. These were partially offset by mix pressures from lower-margin consumables, cost inflation, higher distribution and merchandise costs, and elevated shrink. Adjusted SG&A expenses expanded principally from the unfavorable general liability insurance claims and higher payroll expenses, depreciation, amortization, and repairs and maintenance. \n Family Dollar's net sales increased by 7% to $3.7 billion. Adjusted operating income was $7.2 million compared to $1.4 million, and adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points on a 160 basis point increase in adjusted gross margin, offset by a 140 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Adjusted gross margin increased primarily from lower freight, mark-on increases resulting from vendor allowances, lower occupancy and distribution costs, partially offset by higher shrink and sales mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily from unfavorable general liability claims, store labor investments, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Inventory decreased by 6.2%, reflecting a decrease of $337 million. Relative to last year, our sell-through of seasonal merchandise was strong. In addition, we had more capitalized freight costs and inventory last year. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $784 million versus $328 million, reflecting the record 219 new stores we opened in the quarter, and elevated investments in other renovations, supply chain and IT to support our growth initiatives.  \n Free cash flow declined by $82 million versus the fourth quarter last year, reflecting higher levels of capital expenditures at year-end. For fiscal 2023, free cash flow improved by $217 million versus the same period last year led largely by lower merchandise inventories and the timing of accounts payable with a partial offset from lower net income adjusted for noncash items and increased CapEx. This improvement for the full year comes despite a challenging macro environment and significantly higher levels of investments to support our multiyear growth strategy. \n Given the portfolio review process, we did not repurchase any shares in the open market during Q4. For the year, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $504 million, including applicable excise tax. At the end of fiscal 2023, we had $1.35 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $685 million compared to $643 million. At year-end, our leverage as defined under our revolving credit agreement, stood at approximately 2.4x. \n Before I move on to our fiscal '24 and Q1 outlook, I'd like to take a moment to level set our 2023 performance to give you some deeper perspective on the foundation upon which our 2024 outlook is built. We think the best way to look at fiscal '23 is to start with our non-GAAP adjusted full year EPS of $5.89. As I mentioned earlier, this adds back all the costs associated with the portfolio review, the goodwill and trade name impairments, and the West Memphis resolution.\n On top of that, we got about $0.29 related to costs we called out in quarters 2, 3 and 4, including the insurance true ups, the OTC recall and other discrete items. Finally, the 53rd week this year added an extra $0.35 of EPS. Taking all that into consideration gets you to approximately $5.83 of EPS coming from the underlying operating performance of the business in 2023 on a 52-week basis.\n So with this $5.83 as a 2023 starting point, I'd like to discuss a few items that we expect to affect the actual operating performance of the business in 2024. First, lower ground and ocean freight costs benefited our full year 2023 EPS by approximately $1.50, which was nicely ahead of our original expectations. On the other side of the ledger, shrink and mix hurt EPS by approximately $1.15 on a full year basis, which is also more than we originally expected. Said another way, the 2023 shrink and mix headwinds offset about 3/4 of the benefit we received from lower freight costs last year. \n The good news is that, based on current rates, we expect to realize additional freight savings in FY '24. The bad news is that the base level of shrink and mix headwinds is meaningfully worse than we had previously expected. We anticipate these headwinds to be concentrated in the first half of 2024 and then moderate longer term as the macro environment normalizes and our self-help initiatives start to yield results. In light of these factors and to address the immediate macroeconomic environment, in 2024, we will be optimizing our SG&A and capital expenditure investments to support our growth initiatives. \n So with that, let's move on to our full year and Q1 outlook. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2024 are expected to be in the range of $31 billion to $32 billion. For the full year, we expect low to mid-single-digit comparable net sales growth for the enterprise, low single-digit growth for the Family Dollar segment, and mid-single-digit growth for the Dollar Tree segment. Adjusting for the stores that are closing as part of the portfolio optimization, we expect fiscal year '24 net sales for the Family Dollar segment to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Diluted EPS for the full year is expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $7.30. \n For Q1, we expect net sales to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion based on comparable net sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for both the enterprise and Dollar Tree segment, and approximately flat for the Family Dollar segment. Diluted EPS for the first quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.48. Our outlook for Q1 and fiscal '24 does not include any severance or other incremental costs related to the portfolio review process. \n Having given you our high-level expectations, let me share some of the key factors and assumptions that are incorporated in our fiscal '24 outlook. We expect full year gross margin in the Dollar Tree segment will be in the range of 36% to 36.5%, reflecting our strong comp outlook for the year and reduced freight expenses. In the Family Dollar segment, we expect full year gross margin will be in the range of 24.5% to 25% as elevated shrink, unfavorable mix and reduced SNAP benefits remain headwinds through at least the first half of the year. \n We expect lower freight costs to provide approximately $0.80 to $0.90 of full year EPS benefit in fiscal '24. This is a bit below the $1 benefit we've discussed previously and reflects the current conditions in the global shipping market, including lower water levels in the Panama Canal and the Red Sea situation. We expect approximately 60% of the freight savings to come in the first half of the year, with Q1 seeing the greatest benefit before it moderates in each subsequent quarter. \n Our fiscal '24 outlook also assumes approximately $0.30 to $0.35 of EPS headwinds from unfavorable mix and elevated shrink. Nearly all of these headwinds will be absorbed in the first half of the year as we annualize our 2023 exit rate on these items, with approximately 2/3 of the impact coming in Q1 and the balance in Q2. While we don't expect to get meaningful relief from shrink and mix pressures in the back half of the year, we expect the year-over-year impact to be more or less neutral in the back half. \n We expect full year SG&A expenses as a percent of total revenue will be approximately 25%. Our fiscal '24 SG&A outlook for the Dollar Tree segment reflects the incremental onetime reconfiguration costs that we expect to absorb at each of the 3,000 stores we are scheduled for conversion into our expanded and fully integrated multi-price format this year. Within our overall SG&A expenses, we expect full year corporate, support and other expenses will be in the range of 1.8% to 1.9% of total revenue. \n The Family Dollar store closures are expected to be approximately $0.15 accretive to EPS, mostly in the second half of the year as we close these stores throughout the first half. Adjusting for the timing impacts of all of these items, we believe approximately 38% of our full year EPS will be achieved in the first half of the year, with the remaining 62% coming in the back half. From a seasonality perspective, fourth quarter is historically our strongest earnings quarter. \n And finally, here are a few other modeling items to consider. Full year depreciation should be approximately $1 billion, which is approximately $0.55 higher year-over-year on an EPS basis, reflecting the additional depreciation and amortization associated with the $2.1 billion of CapEx spent in fiscal '23. \n We expect net interest expense of approximately $95 million for the year and $26 million for Q1. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24% for both Q1 and the year. We expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Finally, our outlook assumes no share repurchases, but we do have $1.35 billion of capacity under our remaining authorization. \n And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: There was certainly a number of moving parts last quarter. As a result, our reported earnings included a few unexpected items. That said, if you peel away the layers, we produced some very good operating results in a very challenging macro environment.  \n Considering what we accomplished, while continuing to execute upon multiple strategic initiatives, we have much to be proud of. And as I discussed earlier, we are continuing to invest in our risk mitigation, food and product safety and compliance programs in order to keep building on the foundation of service that defines this company. \n Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment led by multi-price is exceeding expectations and gaining momentum. In the Family Dollar segment, we are taking the steps, as I outlined earlier, to fortify our base, strengthen our brand and position Family Dollar to achieve its full potential. I couldn't be prouder of our organization and our 200,000 associates across Dollar Tree and Family Dollar for their continued contribution to our success. I am truly honored to lead and to be part of the best team in retail. \n Operator, with that, Jeff and I are ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: So I wanted to start -- maybe, Rick, just take a step back and talk about how the company or how you are thinking about the company's outlook and the confidence in the strategy around the individual businesses are evolving. So you take your core Dollar Tree segment, the rollout of multi-price point seems to be going very well. How is your view on the opportunity there changing? \n And then Family Dollar, obviously, not where it needs to be. What does that say? I'm sure you're not going to throw good money at the bad here. And then as part of all of that, is $10 still in play, maybe you just get there differently? Just thoughts on how things are evolving for you would be, I think, helpful. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Great question. And hey, I'd like to throw on the table, Jeff and I talked a little longer than normal. And for those of you that are interested, we'll go past the 9:00 straight up, and give you a little more time for questions. \n As I think about, Ed, there is a -- this is a sum-of-the-parts story at the end of the day. And what's important here is we're very intently focused on creating shareholder value. The Dollar Tree multi-price point strategy is doing significantly better than we thought it would do. The customer acceptance has been off the charts to be frank. Our biggest problem right now is getting enough merchandise into the stores fast enough so the consumer can respond. \n Family Dollar is a victim of the macro environment out there. If you think about the increase in shrink, which I thought would have moderated, if anything, by now, but it's continuing to accelerate. And then the pressure on the mix. But again, I come back to a well-run Family Dollar is a very, very powerful retail format. And I think what we're doing is making the right decisions to fortify the base in Family Dollar and position it so we can go forward in a more stronger position. \n Now, in regards to the $10, we continue to believe in the $10 target that we announced, well, I guess, about a year ago, and we're continuing to march toward that goal. However, the macro environment has gotten in our way and we are dealing with high, high shrink numbers. We're dealing with big mix shifts. So it's a little difficult for us to pinpoint that $10 target going forward. We still believe in the target, but we believe the path is to get to $7 in 2024, and we're intently focused on that. But again, we want a positive 2024. And then as we move through '24 and '25, we'll give you more of a handle on the $10. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nUriel Zachary Abraham: This is Zach on for Simeon Gutman. Can you provide any additional color on how you're thinking about the comp outlook in '24? Specifically, what are your assumptions for the progression of ticket and traffic throughout the year? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. I mean obviously, our guidance -- we're looking for a strong year, particularly on the Dollar Tree side. And I think as we get into quarter 4, that is our big time of the year in terms of discretionary in Dollar Tree. We believe the initiatives that we're putting in place in Dollar Tree are definitely delivering very positive comp.\n Family Dollar, as Jeff called out, is going to be a little tougher. And it's driven by the mix shift and it's also driven by, quite honestly, the pressure on the low-end consumer in terms of income and the SNAP benefits. We will cycle through the SNAP benefits as we move towards the end of the year, but we feel very comfortable with our comp outlook. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So two questions. Maybe, could you elaborate on the traffic trends and market share by demographic that you're seeing at the Dollar Tree banner? And just any change in underlying momentum at Dollar Tree quarter to date?\n And then in light of the portfolio optimization, just your confidence in the go-forward Family Dollar fleet or maybe if you could share some performance across the curve in terms of the store base. And just lastly, potential opportunity to accelerate unit growth at Dollar Tree as you see it, just given the performance. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Dollar Tree, the fastest-growing demographic is north of $125,000 a year in income, which brings a lot more firepower to the store, to be honest with you. And I think, quite honestly, I think that attraction is the multi-price point, and the fact that we've been able to increase the variety of product in the store. And I think the interesting thing about Dollar Tree, the lift is pretty universal across all the operating markets. It's not like the Northeast is strong and the West is weak, it's where -- that boat is lifting pretty even all the way up. \n When I look at the potential for Family Dollar and the optimization, again, it's a sum-of-the-parts story. And there are many opportunities in Family Dollar to maximize shareholder value. And what we intend to do, we know how well Dollar Tree is performing. As we said on our call, we're going to shift our focus to opening more Dollar Trees than we historically have done in the past. And quite frankly, it's been driven by the work on the coolers, and it's being driven by the multi-price point, that's made the box more viable. \n But I think the rationalization of the portfolio was a natural step. And now what we could do by eliminating a bunch of underperforming stores, which take the bulk of the district managers' time, we can now focus them on the stores that are doing better. \nJeffrey Davis: If I may add just one additional point. If you think about the Family Dollar segment, one of the things that we're really proud of is that we continue to take market share across units, dollars, traffic. So what we're doing there within this banner is working for us. We have found that we are under a little more pressure with our particular higher penetration in lower income customer segment. But we believe the other merchandising and operating actions that we're taking will allow us to further unlock the value of this remaining portfolio of stores that we have within the Family Dollar brand. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Just a couple for me. Jeff, can you unpack the margin guide by banner? I'm just trying to isolate if you're still anticipating another year of a loss at Family Dollar.\n And then Rick, just bigger picture, when you look -- with input prices dropping, can you talk about how your merchants are adding more value, particularly at the Dollar Tree and particularly at that $1.25 price point? \nRichard Dreiling: Can you take the first one? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. So on Dollar Tree, for example, on the margin, we're guiding to 36% to 36.5%. That's a combination of a couple of things. One, as we continue to roll out the multi-price offering, that is going to place a little bit of pressure on us from a margin rate perspective, but you're really going to like the dollars that's going to be driving with units.\n We do anticipate -- we had mentioned that we're anticipating about another $0.80 to $0.90 of freight that's going to be more heavily realized on the Dollar Tree side. And as I've mentioned, we'll expect to see about 60% of that in the first half of the year. So the margin on the Dollar Tree side is going to be sort of led by additional freight and then offset partially as a result of the roll out of the 3,000 stores and multi-price and further penetration in some of the other stores. But all in all, a very healthy 36% to 36.5% gross margin. \n And listen, Dollar Tree also is not immune to some of the issues we're having with shrink as well as the overall mix impact across the business. A little more profound when you get to the Family Dollar side of the business, while they will have a modest impact on the freight because we do import there also, but the impact there is really on the shrink and mix, offset by or actually lifted by further penetration of our private label product as well as our opportunity within OTC and HBA, which are normally higher margin opportunities for us. \nRichard Dreiling: And the only thing I'd add to that, Chuck, especially on the Dollar Tree side. When input cost goes down, the fact that we have fixed price points allows the Dollar Tree team to reengineer the product and bring a greater value to the table. And that's how that franchise has been built over the years. And so it's $1.25, it might stay $1.25, but it brings more value to the table, to the consumer. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Partners. \nJohn Heinbockel: I wanted to focus on the multi-price point journey, right? So going from 3 doors to 8, how do you think you'll attack that, right, 3 to 8 all at once in certain stores or staggered? How long do you think it will take to kind of replanogram Plus, the old Plus, right, into the categories? And then do you have a view -- like multi-price point penetration, when do we get to 10%? That seems like a fair mile marker. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Great questions. First thing I'll say to you, John, is we will stagger the rollout. I like to spread an initiative over time. That way, it turns into a gift that keeps on giving. So that's kind of our first plan on that. \n The penetration, I would say right now, if Rick McNeely was in the room, the demand is insatiable from the customer. I like the 10% number that you threw out. We're going to be -- we were 8.8% in quarter 4. So yes. I think it is -- right now of all of the things we're doing, and I got Jeff shaking his head, I would call it the gift that keeps on giving right now. And we're just really pleased with it. \nJeffrey Davis: And then I believe that the last part of the question, if I'm hearing it correctly, is about the timing of doing the replanograming, if you will, of the Plus section. First of all, we don't planogram. So that's an easier part to look at this. But as we think about doing some reconfiguration of the store to bring in the multi-price in line with other products, we're starting to do that this year, and that's the 3,000 stores that we expect to deliver this year. \nRichard Dreiling: And our goal, John, is get the multi-price point in the aisle where it belongs rather than being in the center of the store. We think it's more shoppable and the consumer will trade up. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: Just wanted to ask, first off, two questions related to the store closures. I guess, number one, is there additional opportunity that we should be thinking about here in terms of rebannering in addition to the closures? And then number two, I wanted to see your thoughts around the potential to recapture some of that $700 million of revenue, given the proximity to the other stores. \nRichard Dreiling: Two great questions. As far as rebannering, we've already looked at a modest number of stores that we intend to do that in. And as we move through the portfolio, we will continue to research that.\n The one thing we want to be very careful of is, number one, the proximity to another Dollar Tree. And number two, we want to be careful that we don't distort the Dollar Tree brand. So it's a little more complicated than just standing up saying, change them all to Dollar Trees and move forward. But it's a very good question that we're actually looking at as we speak. \n And what was the second part of the question? \nMichael Montani: Recapturing sales. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, recapturing the sales. I think we feel pretty bullish about that. A lot of these stores that were rationalizing out of the system were built on top of another store. And there is the opportunity for us to take back some cannibalization. And I think it's a matter of time. And of course, we're going to continue to build new stores next year. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if we could ask about the supply chain, the changes that you've been making, and how it's impacted inventory levels and turns. \nRichard Dreiling: I mean, I'll speak to half that question, and let Jeff do the hard part. \n The fascinating thing -- depends on how many cases a store gets in an order to determine how many hours of savings there are. But I can tell you this, we've reduced our unload time to approximately 1 hour, which will benefit us long-term majorly, especially in terms of store standards, in stocks, which should lead to higher transactions, and the rest will be history having been through it. And in regards to inventory? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. So from a supply chain basis, one of the things we've been very focused on this past year is, not only in stock in the stores, but how we get in stock in the DCs. So working with our supplier partners to make sure that we're getting the merchandise at a timely basis according to the POs that we've placed. We've actually seen some good improvement in that area, which has benefited us ultimately in having our inventories in store at the time that we need to. \n The fourth quarter is just an example of that, where last year, we had a little bit more supply chain disruption. The year before this year, we were able to have the merchandise in-country, in DC, in our stores, and that helped us with our overall sell-through, which ultimately helped us on our inventory levels at year-end because we were able to flow that through versus not having any inventory at the right time for the customer. \n But I believe, overall, the other actions that we're taking with respect to some of our systems to give us better visibility into where our inventories lie and where our needs are across the network will allow us to further improve on our in-stock positions. \nRichard Dreiling: And Kate, if I -- I'd like to call out, Mike Kindy, who's been with me for years, he's driving the supply chain now. And again, you raised a very good question.\n Mike is working on 2 things: the inbound service rate, which is getting the right inventory here at the right time; and then the outbound service rate, which is shipping what the stores are drawing. And we've had trouble with that, to be frank, over the years. But again, it's another example of improvements we're making. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Two questions. Just curious what's driving the average ticket lower at Dollar Tree, even as you add the higher price points? And how do you think about enrolling in those high-priced items, the eventual impact on the average ticket at Dollar Tree? \n And then second, and sorry if I missed this, but what's the cash cost of closing the 600 stores of Family Dollar? And maybe if you can talk about the locations of those stores. Are they concentrated in certain geographies? Any common threads other than just not earning their cost of capital? \nRichard Dreiling: I'll let you manage the second part, which is the hard part. The -- what we're seeing is the reason our average ticket is down, I think it's because we're seeing more trips. People are coming more often. I think eventually, that will probably shake itself out, but it's all driven by the frequency of which the customer is coming in. \nJeffrey Davis: Just to top that off also, what we've seen is that when a customer has a multi-price item in their basket, their basket many times is as much as 2x the average basket. So as it relates to the variety that we're asked that we're providing, it's definitely giving us a larger basket. But as Rick has said, the additional traffic, people are coming more often and their basket is just on average, lower.\n As it relates to the stores that we're taking action on, from a geography standpoint, there's really no real concentration across the country. It's pretty much reflective of our overall fleet demographics, if you will, across the country. \n As it relates to the cash cost of closing these stores, on a cash basis, we'll actually be neutral to actually accretive in closing these stores. And it really comes from the fact that from a P&L perspective, you pick up the idea that you no longer have to carry the rents, but the stranded costs associated with the ongoing cost of running the dark store is going to be less than if you were operating the store. And net-net, you would actually pick up just a little bit of cash versus if we were running these stores and operating them under a loss position. \n Over time, that actually gets better as these stores start to run off whatever remaining portion of their lease. So the cash requirement is reduced pretty substantially over the next 3 years. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. \nPeter Keith: I wanted to dig into the SNAP headwind of negative 5% on Family Dollar. Could you quantify how you got to that math? Because if I'm doing the math myself, I look at about a 35% decline in SNAP for the quarter on about 7% to 8% of sales is about a 2.5% headwind overall. \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. The way we're looking at this, once again, it depends on the -- your assumption on the penetration of our customer. But as we take a look at what that SNAP customer means for us and how we've been looking at the sort of contribution on a year-over-year basis, that's how we derive the 5%. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I wanted to ask, what -- as you guys are looking at the Family Dollar stores that you're closing, I was just kind of curious, like what part of the transformation strategy work that you guys have done in the past year or so, I guess, do you feel won't work in those stores? Like, was there something that you just felt like -- I guess it's a lost cause, for lack of a better term? But maybe you could just share some thoughts around that where maybe like help the other stores that do continue to run and what works there that didn't work in these stores. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Another really good question. I would look at you and say the initiatives have worked in every store. The problem is the magnitude of the lift. And I think also as we looked at these stores, it was their location, the competitive environment, the quality of the facility, the proximity to the competition. There was many, many, many factors.\n And we have had in the past a real estate strategy that wasn't really, really focused on maximizing value. And what we've done now is pick stores that we don't think have a long-term future, and more importantly, hopefully, we'll be able to transfer some sales from this closed store into one of our operating stores. \n So I mean, it's a pretty thorough process. And the important question is, why didn't they get the lift from the initiatives of the other stores that we're keeping, obviously, which is the bulk of the portfolio. It has to do merely with a lot of other extraneous factors. \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. And just to add back, I think actually, Paul had a portion of his question I didn't answer that was on this very topic. Many of these stores were operating unfortunately at a level that the operating loss of these stores was pretty substantial. And even with the lift of some of the initiatives, while we're starting to mute the level of loss, we were still significantly below what we consider to have a reasonable return. Especially when we think about the additional investments that we would want to make in these stores as it relates to store standards, as it relates to just a number of other things, that it just wouldn't be able to carry a return on the additional investment for these stores.\n A lot of this is driven by the fact that over time, rents shrink and a number of other exogenous sort of factors has driven the store to a point where, unfortunately, they're just operating at a very significant loss. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nBradley Thomas: Rick, I was hoping you could talk a little bit on the Family Dollar side about the consumables category. And I was hoping, you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, how you're feeling about pricing and some of the opportunities to drive share going forward? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. On the consumables side and Family Dollar, as we have gotten our mix right inside the store in terms of the SKU count, remember, we discontinued 1,000 and added 2,000 for a net of 1,900 and change. We're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of movement. We've made the consumable mix more relevant. And add to that, the emphasis that we have placed on private brands. And now you have a national brand equivalent item that the consumer can purchase. And I think our consumable mix, to be honest, is the best it's been in Family Dollar, hearkens back to my old days as a grocer.\n In regards to pricing activity out there, the market continues to be relatively stable. I would even say, the promotional activity on the weekly flyers is relatively stable. It's not like we're seeing anything that's really wild. And I think our pricing position for Family Dollars is as good as it's ever been. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. \nJoshua Young: This is Josh Young on for Scott. Could you guys just clarify what are you going to do with the inventory at the stores slated for closure? So in other words, are there discounts which may boost sales and hurt margins? Or will inventory just be shifted to other stores? And is that all captured in your guidance? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. So first of all, it is captured in our guidance. And the way that we'll do this is, given the announcement of the timing of the store closure, we'll run a series of different discounts to help move through the inventory. Also, as part of the impairment that we've taken, we've also already accounted for an impairment of that value of inventory at some level in order to ultimately realize the sale. \nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you all very much for your time today, and looking forward to talking to you again in the near future. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Dreiling",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. This past year, our organization made meaningful progress in the ongoing transformation of our core business, which includes building a foundation for sustainable growth. While I have been Chairman and CEO for a year now, we are still in the early stages of this transformation journey. We're off to a good start and we remain focused, and we are excited about the remaining transformation work that lies ahead of us. \n You've heard me say that sales per square foot, transactions and units are among the most important benchmarks in retail. I am pleased to report that we are seeing growth across all three, and momentum is building across the business. We are making progress on the operational objectives of our transformation. And in some areas, we are seeing positive results earlier than we expected. While the transformation process is dynamic, we remain focused on delivering against our core growth objectives and as always, navigating through the challenges we encounter along the way. \n As I previewed on our last call, we are also taking decisive steps to strengthen the Family Dollar brand and better position it to achieve its full potential. We took a thoughtful and deliberate approach to address underperforming stores by considering each individual store's performance, local operating environment, and our broader need for scale and operating efficiencies across the portfolio. As part of the portfolio review process, we have identified approximately 600 Family Dollar stores that we will close in the first half of fiscal 2024. Additionally, approximately 370 more Family Dollar, and 30 Dollar Tree stores will close at the end of each store's current lease term. \n We believe rationalizing these unprofitable locations will help to unlock meaningful value at the enterprise level. Collectively, we estimate that net sales loss from the stores we intend to close this year is approximately $730 million on an annual run rate basis. On the other hand, given their historical underperformance, we would get back approximately $0.30 of annual run rate EPS net of any stranded costs.\n Now, let me shift gears and discuss our fourth quarter results. On a consolidated basis, net sales increased 12% to $8.6 billion, including a $560 million benefit from this year's 53rd week. Enterprise comp grew by 3% with 4.6% higher traffic, offsetting a 1.5% lower ticket. Adjusted operating income increased by 21% to $749 million. Adjusted EPS grew 25% to $2.55. \n While our quarter 4 reported EPS on an adjusted basis was below our quarter 4 outlook, these results include $0.17 of net costs, primarily related to actuarial insurance adjustments that were not contemplated in our outlook. Jeff will provide more detail on this in his remarks, but without these unanticipated costs, quarter 4 operating results exceeded our expectations.\n Looking at performance by banner. Dollar Tree segment comps were up 6.3% on 7.1% more traffic, and a 0.7% decrease in ticket. Traffic and ticket both improved sequentially. This strong quarter 4 comp came on top of an 8.7% comp last year. Dollar Tree's consumable comp was up 10.8%, and its discretionary comp was up 3.1%, a 200 basis point sequential increase from quarter 3 and an impressive accomplishment given the general weakness in discretionary demand across retail. The quarter's consumable comp came on top of a 9% comp last year. As pleased as we are with Dollar Tree's quarter 4 performance, it's worth noting that we believe January's winter storms negatively impacted comp by about 70 basis points. \n In quarter 4, Dollar Tree continued to take unit market share in consumables. According to Nielsen, our unit volume grew 8%, while the market declined 1.5%. These strong gains in traffic and market share are supported by Dollar Tree's ability to attract new and higher income customers. \n Continuing recent trends, Dollar Tree added 3.4 million new customers in 2023, mostly from households earning over $125,000 a year. We attribute Dollar Tree's exceptional performance to the range of initiatives we have been implementing. \n One of the most important initiatives at Dollar Tree is our multi-price point strategy, which we're calling More Choices. The underlying premise here is that we can present a more relevant assortment to our customers if we are free to offer items at a variety of price points. Here, we are making tremendous progress. We have substantially completed the rollout of $3, $4, and $5 frozen and refrigerated items, which are now available in more than 6,500 stores. Today, we typically offer multi-price frozen product in 3 coolers within our usual 10-cooler bank. Over time, that will evolve to 8 out of 10 as we expand the assortment.\n By the end of 2023, we introduced $3 and $5 center store merchandise to approximately 5,000 Dollar Tree stores, and expect to add another 2,000 stores this year. We are especially excited about the next phase of our multi-price expansion strategy. Dollar Tree's Chief Merchandising Officer, Rick McNeely and his team, are continuously working on new ways to deliver value while expanding our assortment across a wider range of price points. This expanded assortment will offer Dollar Tree shoppers a wider range of choices across a variety of categories, including food and snacks, beverages, pet care, personal care and more. \n This year, across 3,000 stores, we expect to expand our multi-price assortment by over 300 items at price points ranging from $1.50 to $7. But even as our multi-price assortment expands over time, the vast majority of the items sold in Dollar Tree stores will remain at our entry-level fixed price point. Over time, you will also see us fully integrate multi-price merchandise more into our stores so our shoppers will find $5 bags of dog food next to our traditional $1.25 pet treats and toys, and our $3 bags of candy will be found in the candy aisle. This is the next exciting chapter of the Dollar Tree value story, new items, more choices and more savings. \n Now let's turn to Family Dollar. Here, persistent inflation and reduced government benefits continue to pressure the lower income consumers that comprise a sizable portion of Family Dollar's customer base. Accordingly, Family Dollar's quarter 4 comp declined 1.2% as a 0.7% traffic increase was more than offset by 2% ticket decline. Family Dollar's consumables comp decelerated sequentially to 2.2% in quarter 4 from 6.2% in quarter 3. Discretionary comp was down a full 12%. As challenging as this was, it was a slight sequential improvement over quarter 3. Categories like apparel, home decor, electronics and general merchandise remain weak as lower income consumers continue to be very deliberate about their spending. \n Family Dollar continued to take unit and dollar market share in consumables even as lower income consumers struggle with reduced SNAP benefits and other macro pressures. In fact, we estimate the reduced SNAP payments for total quarter 4 comps by about 5 points, and when coupled with the weak discretionary demand, the comp impact was closer to 7 points. Looking forward, we expect reduced SNAP benefits will be a headwind through at least the first half of FY '24 before comparisons ease. \n While the operating environment remains difficult, I don't believe the challenges we face are structural, and I continue to believe that a well-run and well-located Family Dollar store is a powerful retail force. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking aggressive actions to address underperforming stores.\n Looking through the transient factors that weighed on comps throughout 2023, I am encouraged by the fact that in a more normalized operating environment, our comps would have been higher. We believe our ongoing market share gains are a strong validation of the many initiatives we have underway. We are gaining traction in the vast majority of stores where they've been implemented, and I continue to believe that the Family Dollar banner is well positioned for long-term improvement as we continue to focus on operational excellence and financial performance. \n Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to update you on some of the key milestones we have achieved so far in our transformation journey. In real estate, we opened 641 new stores last year, which was at the high end of our target of 600 to 650. Selling square footage increased 3.6%, which was ahead of target. We are placing a greater emphasis on Dollar Tree openings given the attractive returns and performance, and we expect the vast majority of our new store openings in fiscal 2024 will be Dollar Trees. I'm excited about the overall quality of our project pipeline for both banners. \n In supply chain, our DC in Matthews, North Carolina is now providing roto cart deliveries to approximately 600 Family Dollar stores, and we are also testing roto carts deliveries to Dollar Tree stores from our DC here in Chesapeake. By the end of this year, over 3,000 stores should be receiving roto cart deliveries from a total of 6 DCs, 4 for Dollar Tree, and 2 for Family Dollar. As expected, we are already seeing a meaningful reduction in unloading times at stores using roto carts, and we expect those efficiencies will continue to build. \n Expanding and modernizing our trailer fleet is an important part of the roto cart initiative. To this end, we added nearly 900 new trailers with lift gates to the fleet in 2023, and expect to add 2,000 more this coming year. By the end of 2023, 9 of our DCs were temperature controlled. By the end of this year, all 25 of our DCs should be either fully temperature-controlled or have dedicated temperature-controlled facilities on site. \n Temperature-controlled DCs help reduce cross-stocking costs and allow us to carry OTC and other temperature-sensitive products throughout our distribution network. They also increase productivity by providing associates with a safer and more comfortable working environment.\n And finally, we continue to make progress on our completely revamped Family Dollar DC in West Memphis, which should improve the overall efficiency of our distribution network. As you probably saw in the news last month, Family Dollar reached a resolution with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its West Memphis DC, and we are pleased to have this situation behind us. As part of our ongoing transformation efforts, we continue to strengthen and enhance our food and product safety protocols and our compliance oversight. \n In our IT modernization, our new warehouse management system is up and running at its first DC. Concurrent with this rollout, we are also deploying and integrating our new transportation management and labor management system. Over time, we expect these enterprise-wide solutions to contribute to the optimization of our distribution network and labor efficiency. We have also installed new network infrastructure in over 3,800 stores, bringing improved Internet connectivity, security and in-store WiFi access to better support store operations.\n Since our last report, we have also begun implementation work on both our new enterprise-wide POS solution and our new human capital and payroll management system. We have also launched new mobile apps for both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. The Family Dollar app allows us to offer more targeted promotions and a better customer experience. The Dollar Tree app gives shoppers the ability to see new products, view weekly ads, receive notifications about great deals and do price checks.\n In private brands, we launched approximately 250 new SKUs, and converted over 300 control brands to private brands. The private brand program is one of the most significant initiatives underway at Family Dollar. And I'm excited that we now have a highly competitive offering that expands our assortment across multiple categories and offers the Family Dollar consumer national brand equivalent products at compelling values. By the end of last year, our private brand penetration reached 15%, 100 basis points ahead of our target, and a great head start towards reaching our 20% goal by 2026.\n On category resets, I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize Family Dollar's Chief Merchandising Officer, Larry Gatta and his team for their efforts to expand and improve our merchandising assortment. By the end of 2023, we successfully raised the merchandise height profile to 78 inches across the banner, and optimize our assortment with the addition of approximately 900 net new SKUs. \n These efforts are already having a meaningful impact on our results, adding 130 basis points to our quarter 4 comp, which helped offset at least some of the impact from the softer macro environment and comparatively weaker discretionary demand. This reset was a major undertaking for Larry's team, and our new planograms will allow us to expand and improve our product assortment and help Family Dollar gain additional market share. \n We are also moving forward with our goal of increasing the number of cooler doors in Family Dollar stores. We added over 17,000 cooler doors last year, which was 1,000 doors above our target, and brought our average across the Family Dollar segment to 26 coolers per store, which is approaching our goal of 30 coolers per store.  \n In summary, we continue to execute well around factors that we can control. I've said before that our progress on this journey will include challenges with the belief that we will succeed more often than not in our efforts, but the direction and destination remain clear, which is the long-term health and success of our business for the benefit of our customers, associates, stakeholders and partners.  \n Our growth initiatives are central to this journey and we are focused on continually improving, even in the face of a rapidly evolving macro landscape. We have an outstanding team with a cultural foundation focused on service to the customer and improving our performance each and every day. We remain relentlessly focused on retail fundamentals and continue to take market share. \n While challenges and macroeconomic factors will always be part of any retail journey, we continue to face them head on as they arise. We're excited about where we are and optimistic about where we are headed. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. There was certainly a number of moving parts last quarter. As a result, our reported earnings included a few unexpected items. That said, if you peel away the layers, we produced some very good operating results in a very challenging macro environment.  \n Considering what we accomplished, while continuing to execute upon multiple strategic initiatives, we have much to be proud of. And as I discussed earlier, we are continuing to invest in our risk mitigation, food and product safety and compliance programs in order to keep building on the foundation of service that defines this company. \n Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment led by multi-price is exceeding expectations and gaining momentum. In the Family Dollar segment, we are taking the steps, as I outlined earlier, to fortify our base, strengthen our brand and position Family Dollar to achieve its full potential. I couldn't be prouder of our organization and our 200,000 associates across Dollar Tree and Family Dollar for their continued contribution to our success. I am truly honored to lead and to be part of the best team in retail. \n Operator, with that, Jeff and I are ready to take questions. Yes. Great question. And hey, I'd like to throw on the table, Jeff and I talked a little longer than normal. And for those of you that are interested, we'll go past the 9:00 straight up, and give you a little more time for questions. \n As I think about, Ed, there is a -- this is a sum-of-the-parts story at the end of the day. And what's important here is we're very intently focused on creating shareholder value. The Dollar Tree multi-price point strategy is doing significantly better than we thought it would do. The customer acceptance has been off the charts to be frank. Our biggest problem right now is getting enough merchandise into the stores fast enough so the consumer can respond. \n Family Dollar is a victim of the macro environment out there. If you think about the increase in shrink, which I thought would have moderated, if anything, by now, but it's continuing to accelerate. And then the pressure on the mix. But again, I come back to a well-run Family Dollar is a very, very powerful retail format. And I think what we're doing is making the right decisions to fortify the base in Family Dollar and position it so we can go forward in a more stronger position. \n Now, in regards to the $10, we continue to believe in the $10 target that we announced, well, I guess, about a year ago, and we're continuing to march toward that goal. However, the macro environment has gotten in our way and we are dealing with high, high shrink numbers. We're dealing with big mix shifts. So it's a little difficult for us to pinpoint that $10 target going forward. We still believe in the target, but we believe the path is to get to $7 in 2024, and we're intently focused on that. But again, we want a positive 2024. And then as we move through '24 and '25, we'll give you more of a handle on the $10. Yes. I mean obviously, our guidance -- we're looking for a strong year, particularly on the Dollar Tree side. And I think as we get into quarter 4, that is our big time of the year in terms of discretionary in Dollar Tree. We believe the initiatives that we're putting in place in Dollar Tree are definitely delivering very positive comp.\n Family Dollar, as Jeff called out, is going to be a little tougher. And it's driven by the mix shift and it's also driven by, quite honestly, the pressure on the low-end consumer in terms of income and the SNAP benefits. We will cycle through the SNAP benefits as we move towards the end of the year, but we feel very comfortable with our comp outlook. Yes. Dollar Tree, the fastest-growing demographic is north of $125,000 a year in income, which brings a lot more firepower to the store, to be honest with you. And I think, quite honestly, I think that attraction is the multi-price point, and the fact that we've been able to increase the variety of product in the store. And I think the interesting thing about Dollar Tree, the lift is pretty universal across all the operating markets. It's not like the Northeast is strong and the West is weak, it's where -- that boat is lifting pretty even all the way up. \n When I look at the potential for Family Dollar and the optimization, again, it's a sum-of-the-parts story. And there are many opportunities in Family Dollar to maximize shareholder value. And what we intend to do, we know how well Dollar Tree is performing. As we said on our call, we're going to shift our focus to opening more Dollar Trees than we historically have done in the past. And quite frankly, it's been driven by the work on the coolers, and it's being driven by the multi-price point, that's made the box more viable. \n But I think the rationalization of the portfolio was a natural step. And now what we could do by eliminating a bunch of underperforming stores, which take the bulk of the district managers' time, we can now focus them on the stores that are doing better. Can you take the first one? And the only thing I'd add to that, Chuck, especially on the Dollar Tree side. When input cost goes down, the fact that we have fixed price points allows the Dollar Tree team to reengineer the product and bring a greater value to the table. And that's how that franchise has been built over the years. And so it's $1.25, it might stay $1.25, but it brings more value to the table, to the consumer. Yes. Great questions. First thing I'll say to you, John, is we will stagger the rollout. I like to spread an initiative over time. That way, it turns into a gift that keeps on giving. So that's kind of our first plan on that. \n The penetration, I would say right now, if Rick McNeely was in the room, the demand is insatiable from the customer. I like the 10% number that you threw out. We're going to be -- we were 8.8% in quarter 4. So yes. I think it is -- right now of all of the things we're doing, and I got Jeff shaking his head, I would call it the gift that keeps on giving right now. And we're just really pleased with it. And our goal, John, is get the multi-price point in the aisle where it belongs rather than being in the center of the store. We think it's more shoppable and the consumer will trade up. Two great questions. As far as rebannering, we've already looked at a modest number of stores that we intend to do that in. And as we move through the portfolio, we will continue to research that.\n The one thing we want to be very careful of is, number one, the proximity to another Dollar Tree. And number two, we want to be careful that we don't distort the Dollar Tree brand. So it's a little more complicated than just standing up saying, change them all to Dollar Trees and move forward. But it's a very good question that we're actually looking at as we speak. \n And what was the second part of the question? Yes, recapturing the sales. I think we feel pretty bullish about that. A lot of these stores that were rationalizing out of the system were built on top of another store. And there is the opportunity for us to take back some cannibalization. And I think it's a matter of time. And of course, we're going to continue to build new stores next year. I mean, I'll speak to half that question, and let Jeff do the hard part. \n The fascinating thing -- depends on how many cases a store gets in an order to determine how many hours of savings there are. But I can tell you this, we've reduced our unload time to approximately 1 hour, which will benefit us long-term majorly, especially in terms of store standards, in stocks, which should lead to higher transactions, and the rest will be history having been through it. And in regards to inventory? And Kate, if I -- I'd like to call out, Mike Kindy, who's been with me for years, he's driving the supply chain now. And again, you raised a very good question.\n Mike is working on 2 things: the inbound service rate, which is getting the right inventory here at the right time; and then the outbound service rate, which is shipping what the stores are drawing. And we've had trouble with that, to be frank, over the years. But again, it's another example of improvements we're making. I'll let you manage the second part, which is the hard part. The -- what we're seeing is the reason our average ticket is down, I think it's because we're seeing more trips. People are coming more often. I think eventually, that will probably shake itself out, but it's all driven by the frequency of which the customer is coming in. Yes. Another really good question. I would look at you and say the initiatives have worked in every store. The problem is the magnitude of the lift. And I think also as we looked at these stores, it was their location, the competitive environment, the quality of the facility, the proximity to the competition. There was many, many, many factors.\n And we have had in the past a real estate strategy that wasn't really, really focused on maximizing value. And what we've done now is pick stores that we don't think have a long-term future, and more importantly, hopefully, we'll be able to transfer some sales from this closed store into one of our operating stores. \n So I mean, it's a pretty thorough process. And the important question is, why didn't they get the lift from the initiatives of the other stores that we're keeping, obviously, which is the bulk of the portfolio. It has to do merely with a lot of other extraneous factors. Yes. On the consumables side and Family Dollar, as we have gotten our mix right inside the store in terms of the SKU count, remember, we discontinued 1,000 and added 2,000 for a net of 1,900 and change. We're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of movement. We've made the consumable mix more relevant. And add to that, the emphasis that we have placed on private brands. And now you have a national brand equivalent item that the consumer can purchase. And I think our consumable mix, to be honest, is the best it's been in Family Dollar, hearkens back to my old days as a grocer.\n In regards to pricing activity out there, the market continues to be relatively stable. I would even say, the promotional activity on the weekly flyers is relatively stable. It's not like we're seeing anything that's really wild. And I think our pricing position for Family Dollars is as good as it's ever been. Thank you all very much for your time today, and looking forward to talking to you again in the near future."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jeffrey Davis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning. I will first discuss our fourth quarter results. After which, I'll provide some details on the financial impact of the portfolio optimization, and close with our fiscal 2024 and Q1 outlook. \n As I discuss our fourth quarter results, where applicable, I will focus on our non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is provided in our earnings release. Also, as a reminder, our Q4 and full year 2023 results include an extra week of operations, which gave us an incremental $560 million in revenue and $0.35 of EPS for the quarter and the year. \n In the fourth quarter, the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments increased traffic, unit volume and market share despite persistent headwinds from an unfavorable sales mix and reduced SNAP benefits. Looking at the business on a consolidated basis, net sales increased 12% to $8.6 billion. Adjusted operating income was $749 million, a 21% increase from last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points, driven by a 220 basis point increase in adjusted gross margin, and offset by a 150 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. \n Adjusted gross profit increased 20% to $2.9 billion. Adjusted gross margin improvement was driven primarily by lower freight costs, occupancy cost leverage from the extra week, and higher vendor allowances, partially offset by product cost inflation, unfavorable sales mix and elevated shrink.\n Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily from ongoing labor investments, higher incentive compensation, unfavorable general liability claim development and depreciation, partially offset by leverage from additional sales from the extra week. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 23.4%. Adjusted net income was $556 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.55, which includes the $0.17 per share negative impact, primarily from unfavorable general liability insurance claims. \n Before I move on to segment level results, let me spend a moment to walk you through the non-GAAP adjustments in our Q4 results and shed some additional light on the $0.17 per share negative impact, primarily from unfavorable general liability insurance claims. \n The first non-GAAP adjustment was related to the portfolio review process. Here, we incurred total noncash charges of  $594 million, including $86 million for inventory markdowns and $504 million for store asset impairments. We also incurred an additional $4 million of related fees. The second non-GAAP adjustment was a noncash impairment charge of $2 billion for Family Dollar, including $1.1 billion related to goodwill, and $950 million related to the trade name. The third non-GAAP adjustment was a $27 million charge within SG&A related to the resolution we reached with the Department of Justice regarding our West Memphis distribution center. This was in addition to the $30 million West Memphis reserve we recorded in Q1. \n Outside of the non-GAAP adjustments, Q4 results included $0.17 of net EPS headwinds related to items that weren't contemplated in our Q4 outlook. These items include negative adjustments to our general liability accruals, which were partially offset by favorable adjustments to workers' compensation liabilities and the elimination of certain rent and depreciation expenses as part of our Family Dollar impairment process. Adjustments to general liability accruals may sound familiar to many of you as we absorbed $0.07 of EPS impact from this issue in the second quarter of 2023. So let me explain why we are revisiting this in Q4. \n In the process of accruing for potential general liability exposure, predicting the outcome of both existing and unreported claims is inherently complex. We rely on third-party actuarial analysis to estimate insurance reserves on an ongoing basis. As we discussed in our second quarter call, general liability claims have been more volatile in recent years. Since the pandemic, the development of claims has worsened. The charge taken this quarter intends to capture this new environment.  \n To address this over the long term, we have upgraded our risk management capabilities and revised our processes to focus on claim closures, among other areas. As we continue to address all open claims with our new processes, our actuarial studies should reflect more normalized risk exposure over time.  \n Now back to our business segment results. Dollar Tree's net sales increased by 16% to $5 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 21% to $873 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points, driven by a 230 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by a 150 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin improved primarily from lower domestic and import freight costs and favorable occupancy cost leverage due to the 53rd week. These were partially offset by mix pressures from lower-margin consumables, cost inflation, higher distribution and merchandise costs, and elevated shrink. Adjusted SG&A expenses expanded principally from the unfavorable general liability insurance claims and higher payroll expenses, depreciation, amortization, and repairs and maintenance. \n Family Dollar's net sales increased by 7% to $3.7 billion. Adjusted operating income was $7.2 million compared to $1.4 million, and adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points on a 160 basis point increase in adjusted gross margin, offset by a 140 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Adjusted gross margin increased primarily from lower freight, mark-on increases resulting from vendor allowances, lower occupancy and distribution costs, partially offset by higher shrink and sales mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily from unfavorable general liability claims, store labor investments, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Inventory decreased by 6.2%, reflecting a decrease of $337 million. Relative to last year, our sell-through of seasonal merchandise was strong. In addition, we had more capitalized freight costs and inventory last year. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $784 million versus $328 million, reflecting the record 219 new stores we opened in the quarter, and elevated investments in other renovations, supply chain and IT to support our growth initiatives.  \n Free cash flow declined by $82 million versus the fourth quarter last year, reflecting higher levels of capital expenditures at year-end. For fiscal 2023, free cash flow improved by $217 million versus the same period last year led largely by lower merchandise inventories and the timing of accounts payable with a partial offset from lower net income adjusted for noncash items and increased CapEx. This improvement for the full year comes despite a challenging macro environment and significantly higher levels of investments to support our multiyear growth strategy. \n Given the portfolio review process, we did not repurchase any shares in the open market during Q4. For the year, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $504 million, including applicable excise tax. At the end of fiscal 2023, we had $1.35 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $685 million compared to $643 million. At year-end, our leverage as defined under our revolving credit agreement, stood at approximately 2.4x. \n Before I move on to our fiscal '24 and Q1 outlook, I'd like to take a moment to level set our 2023 performance to give you some deeper perspective on the foundation upon which our 2024 outlook is built. We think the best way to look at fiscal '23 is to start with our non-GAAP adjusted full year EPS of $5.89. As I mentioned earlier, this adds back all the costs associated with the portfolio review, the goodwill and trade name impairments, and the West Memphis resolution.\n On top of that, we got about $0.29 related to costs we called out in quarters 2, 3 and 4, including the insurance true ups, the OTC recall and other discrete items. Finally, the 53rd week this year added an extra $0.35 of EPS. Taking all that into consideration gets you to approximately $5.83 of EPS coming from the underlying operating performance of the business in 2023 on a 52-week basis.\n So with this $5.83 as a 2023 starting point, I'd like to discuss a few items that we expect to affect the actual operating performance of the business in 2024. First, lower ground and ocean freight costs benefited our full year 2023 EPS by approximately $1.50, which was nicely ahead of our original expectations. On the other side of the ledger, shrink and mix hurt EPS by approximately $1.15 on a full year basis, which is also more than we originally expected. Said another way, the 2023 shrink and mix headwinds offset about 3/4 of the benefit we received from lower freight costs last year. \n The good news is that, based on current rates, we expect to realize additional freight savings in FY '24. The bad news is that the base level of shrink and mix headwinds is meaningfully worse than we had previously expected. We anticipate these headwinds to be concentrated in the first half of 2024 and then moderate longer term as the macro environment normalizes and our self-help initiatives start to yield results. In light of these factors and to address the immediate macroeconomic environment, in 2024, we will be optimizing our SG&A and capital expenditure investments to support our growth initiatives. \n So with that, let's move on to our full year and Q1 outlook. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2024 are expected to be in the range of $31 billion to $32 billion. For the full year, we expect low to mid-single-digit comparable net sales growth for the enterprise, low single-digit growth for the Family Dollar segment, and mid-single-digit growth for the Dollar Tree segment. Adjusting for the stores that are closing as part of the portfolio optimization, we expect fiscal year '24 net sales for the Family Dollar segment to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Diluted EPS for the full year is expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $7.30. \n For Q1, we expect net sales to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion based on comparable net sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for both the enterprise and Dollar Tree segment, and approximately flat for the Family Dollar segment. Diluted EPS for the first quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.48. Our outlook for Q1 and fiscal '24 does not include any severance or other incremental costs related to the portfolio review process. \n Having given you our high-level expectations, let me share some of the key factors and assumptions that are incorporated in our fiscal '24 outlook. We expect full year gross margin in the Dollar Tree segment will be in the range of 36% to 36.5%, reflecting our strong comp outlook for the year and reduced freight expenses. In the Family Dollar segment, we expect full year gross margin will be in the range of 24.5% to 25% as elevated shrink, unfavorable mix and reduced SNAP benefits remain headwinds through at least the first half of the year. \n We expect lower freight costs to provide approximately $0.80 to $0.90 of full year EPS benefit in fiscal '24. This is a bit below the $1 benefit we've discussed previously and reflects the current conditions in the global shipping market, including lower water levels in the Panama Canal and the Red Sea situation. We expect approximately 60% of the freight savings to come in the first half of the year, with Q1 seeing the greatest benefit before it moderates in each subsequent quarter. \n Our fiscal '24 outlook also assumes approximately $0.30 to $0.35 of EPS headwinds from unfavorable mix and elevated shrink. Nearly all of these headwinds will be absorbed in the first half of the year as we annualize our 2023 exit rate on these items, with approximately 2/3 of the impact coming in Q1 and the balance in Q2. While we don't expect to get meaningful relief from shrink and mix pressures in the back half of the year, we expect the year-over-year impact to be more or less neutral in the back half. \n We expect full year SG&A expenses as a percent of total revenue will be approximately 25%. Our fiscal '24 SG&A outlook for the Dollar Tree segment reflects the incremental onetime reconfiguration costs that we expect to absorb at each of the 3,000 stores we are scheduled for conversion into our expanded and fully integrated multi-price format this year. Within our overall SG&A expenses, we expect full year corporate, support and other expenses will be in the range of 1.8% to 1.9% of total revenue. \n The Family Dollar store closures are expected to be approximately $0.15 accretive to EPS, mostly in the second half of the year as we close these stores throughout the first half. Adjusting for the timing impacts of all of these items, we believe approximately 38% of our full year EPS will be achieved in the first half of the year, with the remaining 62% coming in the back half. From a seasonality perspective, fourth quarter is historically our strongest earnings quarter. \n And finally, here are a few other modeling items to consider. Full year depreciation should be approximately $1 billion, which is approximately $0.55 higher year-over-year on an EPS basis, reflecting the additional depreciation and amortization associated with the $2.1 billion of CapEx spent in fiscal '23. \n We expect net interest expense of approximately $95 million for the year and $26 million for Q1. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24% for both Q1 and the year. We expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Finally, our outlook assumes no share repurchases, but we do have $1.35 billion of capacity under our remaining authorization. \n And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. If I may add just one additional point. If you think about the Family Dollar segment, one of the things that we're really proud of is that we continue to take market share across units, dollars, traffic. So what we're doing there within this banner is working for us. We have found that we are under a little more pressure with our particular higher penetration in lower income customer segment. But we believe the other merchandising and operating actions that we're taking will allow us to further unlock the value of this remaining portfolio of stores that we have within the Family Dollar brand. Yes. So on Dollar Tree, for example, on the margin, we're guiding to 36% to 36.5%. That's a combination of a couple of things. One, as we continue to roll out the multi-price offering, that is going to place a little bit of pressure on us from a margin rate perspective, but you're really going to like the dollars that's going to be driving with units.\n We do anticipate -- we had mentioned that we're anticipating about another $0.80 to $0.90 of freight that's going to be more heavily realized on the Dollar Tree side. And as I've mentioned, we'll expect to see about 60% of that in the first half of the year. So the margin on the Dollar Tree side is going to be sort of led by additional freight and then offset partially as a result of the roll out of the 3,000 stores and multi-price and further penetration in some of the other stores. But all in all, a very healthy 36% to 36.5% gross margin. \n And listen, Dollar Tree also is not immune to some of the issues we're having with shrink as well as the overall mix impact across the business. A little more profound when you get to the Family Dollar side of the business, while they will have a modest impact on the freight because we do import there also, but the impact there is really on the shrink and mix, offset by or actually lifted by further penetration of our private label product as well as our opportunity within OTC and HBA, which are normally higher margin opportunities for us. And then I believe that the last part of the question, if I'm hearing it correctly, is about the timing of doing the replanograming, if you will, of the Plus section. First of all, we don't planogram. So that's an easier part to look at this. But as we think about doing some reconfiguration of the store to bring in the multi-price in line with other products, we're starting to do that this year, and that's the 3,000 stores that we expect to deliver this year. Yes. So from a supply chain basis, one of the things we've been very focused on this past year is, not only in stock in the stores, but how we get in stock in the DCs. So working with our supplier partners to make sure that we're getting the merchandise at a timely basis according to the POs that we've placed. We've actually seen some good improvement in that area, which has benefited us ultimately in having our inventories in store at the time that we need to. \n The fourth quarter is just an example of that, where last year, we had a little bit more supply chain disruption. The year before this year, we were able to have the merchandise in-country, in DC, in our stores, and that helped us with our overall sell-through, which ultimately helped us on our inventory levels at year-end because we were able to flow that through versus not having any inventory at the right time for the customer. \n But I believe, overall, the other actions that we're taking with respect to some of our systems to give us better visibility into where our inventories lie and where our needs are across the network will allow us to further improve on our in-stock positions. Just to top that off also, what we've seen is that when a customer has a multi-price item in their basket, their basket many times is as much as 2x the average basket. So as it relates to the variety that we're asked that we're providing, it's definitely giving us a larger basket. But as Rick has said, the additional traffic, people are coming more often and their basket is just on average, lower.\n As it relates to the stores that we're taking action on, from a geography standpoint, there's really no real concentration across the country. It's pretty much reflective of our overall fleet demographics, if you will, across the country. \n As it relates to the cash cost of closing these stores, on a cash basis, we'll actually be neutral to actually accretive in closing these stores. And it really comes from the fact that from a P&L perspective, you pick up the idea that you no longer have to carry the rents, but the stranded costs associated with the ongoing cost of running the dark store is going to be less than if you were operating the store. And net-net, you would actually pick up just a little bit of cash versus if we were running these stores and operating them under a loss position. \n Over time, that actually gets better as these stores start to run off whatever remaining portion of their lease. So the cash requirement is reduced pretty substantially over the next 3 years. Yes. The way we're looking at this, once again, it depends on the -- your assumption on the penetration of our customer. But as we take a look at what that SNAP customer means for us and how we've been looking at the sort of contribution on a year-over-year basis, that's how we derive the 5%. Yes. And just to add back, I think actually, Paul had a portion of his question I didn't answer that was on this very topic. Many of these stores were operating unfortunately at a level that the operating loss of these stores was pretty substantial. And even with the lift of some of the initiatives, while we're starting to mute the level of loss, we were still significantly below what we consider to have a reasonable return. Especially when we think about the additional investments that we would want to make in these stores as it relates to store standards, as it relates to just a number of other things, that it just wouldn't be able to carry a return on the additional investment for these stores.\n A lot of this is driven by the fact that over time, rents shrink and a number of other exogenous sort of factors has driven the store to a point where, unfortunately, they're just operating at a very significant loss. Yes. So first of all, it is captured in our guidance. And the way that we'll do this is, given the announcement of the timing of the store closure, we'll run a series of different discounts to help move through the inventory. Also, as part of the impairment that we've taken, we've also already accounted for an impairment of that value of inventory at some level in order to ultimately realize the sale."

It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Bob LaFleur, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Go ahead, sir. \nRobert LaFleur: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Dollar Tree's third quarter results.

[Operator Instructions] And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thanks, Bob. I'd like to welcome everyone joining us on the call today. In brief, thanks to the dedication and hard work of our teams and continued execution towards our business transformation, third quarter results were well within our expected range.  \n In a challenging retail environment where the accumulating pressures of inflation, reduced government benefits and depleted savings have negatively affected lower-income consumers, our top line performance outpaced most of our peers. We accomplished this by taking market share in both segments, which we believe reflects the initial impact of our investments and transformation initiatives. \n Despite Family Dollar softer comps and $0.05 per share of unexpected costs from the previously announced voluntary recall of OTC and other products, we delivered $0.97 of EPS. Our sales momentum continues to be mostly traffic driven as we attract new customers and gain both unit and dollar market share.  \n In the last 12 months, we have added 4.3 million new customers at Dollar Tree and 2.3 million new customers at Family Dollar. Importantly, most of these first-time customers come back to shop with us multiple times after their first visit. In fact, our loyal customers are now the third largest retail customer base in the United States.  \n As importantly, Dollar Tree is attracting customers from a broader range of income levels. Most of our new customers over the past year have household incomes over $125,000, and this income demographic was a significant contributor to Dollar Tree's quarter 3 comp growth.\n At Family Dollar, our price value perception remains strong after last year's price investments, which we cycled in July. That said, Family Dollar fell short of our quarter 3 comp expectations.  \n Similar to what other retailers have reported, we experienced softening trends throughout the quarter, particularly in October. As lower-income consumers responded to the accumulated impact of inflation and reduced government benefits, we saw a notable pullback in spending, particularly in higher-margin discretionary categories.  \n I will now review some of our third quarter highlights. For the third quarter, consolidated basis, we delivered a 5.4% increase in our net sales to $7.3 billion. This was driven by comp growth of 3.9%, with traffic up 4.7% and average ticket down a little less than 1%. Operating income came in at $301.7 million, which resulted in EPS of $0.97, including the negative $0.05 impact from the OTC recall.  \n In the Dollar Tree segment, our comp was up 5.4%, with traffic increasing by 7% and average ticket decreasing by 1.5%. We are especially pleased with these results as they come on top of an 8.6% comp last year.  \n Our consumables comp was up 11.1%, and discretionary was up 1.1%. We believe the consumables strength at Dollar Tree this quarter as well as our strong multiyear discretionary comp shows customers are embracing our compelling value proposition in this strained economic environment.  \n According to Nielsen, Dollar Tree gained an impressive [ 30 ] basis points of consumables market share in the third quarter as our unit volume grew 6%, while market unit volume declined.  \n In the Family Dollar segment, our comp was up 2%, with traffic increasing 1.4% and average ticket increasing 0.7%. Our consumable comp was especially strong at 6.2%, while discretionary was down meaningfully at 12.5%, particularly in categories like home decor, electronics and toys.  \n In our view, these trends underscore how lower-income households are under increasing financial stress and directing their spending towards needs-based goods.  \n While traffic and ticket were both positive for the quarter, results did soften substantially as we moved through the quarter, with average ticket turning negative in October as our customers pulled back and we realized the adverse impact of the OTC recall. Even with these external challenges, Family Dollar grew market share in consumables, with both unit and dollar growth exceeding the market by wide margins.  \n Although our low prices enable us to operate from a position of strength in consumables, our lower-income customers at Family Dollar have been especially pressured by reductions in government SNAP benefits. Nationwide, third quarter SNAP benefits were down 23% on a year-over-year basis, which was much more than the 5% reduction in quarter 1 or the 16% reduction in quarter 2.  \n Timing-wise, the month-by-month deceleration in our quarter 3 comps matched the progressive reductions in national SNAP payments throughout the quarter.  \n In addition to pressure from lower SNAP payments, Family Dollar's comps were negatively affected by lower tax refunds this year. That said, I believe that the wide range of growth initiatives we have in place will help us maintain our momentum relative to the competition.  \n As a value retailer, we're uniquely positioned to meet customers' needs in a challenging economic environment. We remain focused on the factors that we can control, and we'll continue to navigate as best we can around those that we don't.  \n Now let me take a few minutes to update you on our transformation journey. Our merchandising, IT and supply chain initiatives are on time and on budget, and we are pleased with our progress to date. \n At Dollar Tree, we're ahead of schedule on our multi-price journey. Our Dollar Tree Plus assortment is now available in 4,500 stores, and we are on track to finish the year with more than 4,900. Our Dollar Tree frozen and refrigerated assortments are now in 6,500 stores, significantly ahead of our original year-end target of 5,500. \n Customers are clearly responding to our expanded multi-price assortment as our research shows us that 17% of U.S. households have purchased a multi-price product from a Dollar Tree store at least once in the past 12 months. Importantly, these customers are adding multi-price products on top of their traditional baskets. For example, in quarter 3, the average multi-price basket included 2.3 multi-priced items and 11.6 traditional $1.25 items.  \n At Family Dollar, we completed our planogram resets by November as scheduled, improving and expanding our product assortment while increasing our shelf profile and merchandising to [ 78 ] inches across the portfolio. We're on track to renovate more than 1,000 Family Dollar stores by year-end. We have now upgraded 1,600 Family Dollar stores to our H 2.5 rural and extra-small box formats.  \n In quarter 3, private brand penetration at Family Dollar reached 14%, a quarter ahead of schedule, and we are on pace to hit our 20% target by 2026. We are also on track to add over 70 new SKUs to our Family Wellness product line and more than 100 new private brand SKUs in total by the end of December. Within that same time frame, we also expect to complete our conversion of 300 control brands to private brands.  \n In real estate, we opened 197 new stores in quarter 3, and we are on track to meet our target of 600 to 650 new stores this year.  \n In supply chain, we are preparing to implement our streamlined delivery process for stores serviced by our Matthews, North Carolina distribution center with roto carts and liftgate trailers starting next month. We have been testing our roto carts, and the feedback has been extremely positive. We remain on schedule for all of our distribution centers to be using roto carts by the end of 2027.  \n Across our teams, the investments we've made in our people, including increased wages in key markets, simplified work at the store level and increased communications throughout the company, are driving meaningful improvements in store turnover and associate satisfaction. \n Additionally, as we prepared for our busiest season of the year, I'm proud to report that our annual National Hiring Day in mid-October was a huge success. We hired nearly 14,000 part-time associates to work in our stores for the current holiday season, an all-time record for this event. \n While we still have a lot of work to do in this transformational journey, I am pleased with what we've accomplished to date. We are focused on our plans to accelerate sales and grow earnings, and I remain confident in our ability to execute this ambitious undertaking.  \n That said, this journey also needs to be dynamic and adapt to changing market conditions and our learnings along the way. We believe being thoughtful about our store portfolio will help enhance our results. \n To maximize value creation, we need to periodically reevaluate our portfolio in terms of current market conditions, individual store performance and overall portfolio considerations. To this end, we have initiated a comprehensive review of our Family Dollar portfolio to address underperforming stores that are not aligned with our transformative vision for the company. \n This will involve, among other things, identifying stores as candidates for closure, rebannering or relocation with the goal of ensuring that each assets under the Family Dollar banner is delivering its full value for our shareholders on a sustainable basis.  \n I am a strong believer in the Family Dollar brand and what it means to our customers and associates in thousands of communities across the country. Going forward, we need to ensure that the Family Dollar portfolio is well positioned for success and meets the financial and operating objectives of our organization and the expectations of our valued customers and associates. We believe that this action will fortify our base, strengthen our brand and allow Family Dollar to achieve its full growth potential.  \n Jeff will now review our financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year. \nJeffrey Davis: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments, both generated higher levels of customer traffic, unit volume and increased market share. Overall, we generated 5% more gross profit dollars in the third quarter than we did last year as consumers continue to respond positively to our growth initiatives. \n Consistent with prior-quarter trends, sales mix continued to shift towards consumables. This trend was more pronounced at Family Dollar, where our third quarter consumables mix reached an all-time high of 82%.  \n Looking at the business on a consolidated basis, net sales increased 5.4% to $7.3 billion. Operating income declined 20.9% to $301.7 million. Operating margin compressed 140 basis points, which was a substantial trend improvement versus the first 2 quarters of the year. The contraction in Q3 operating margin was driven by a 15 basis point decrease in gross margin and a 125 basis point increase in SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin contracted primarily from higher shrink, unfavorable product mix, increased distribution costs and markdowns from the OTC recall. This was partially offset by lower freight costs.  \n While still elevated across both banners, shrink results were mostly in line with our expectations. We have now completed physical inventory checks across more than 90% of our stores, with a balance set for completion in January.  \n SG&A expenses expanded primarily from ongoing labor investments in our stores, IT costs, depreciation and facility costs. Our effective tax rate was 21.8% versus 23.4%. Our tax rate was favorable versus expectations as higher work opportunity tax credits and lower net state taxes were partially offset by higher nondeductible expenses.  \n Net income was $212 million, and diluted EPS was $0.97 versus $1.20. The net impact of the OTC recall was approximately $0.05 per share.\n At the business segment level, Dollar Tree's net sales increased by 6.6% to $4 billion. Operating income declined 3.4% to $482.7 million. And operating margin compressed approximately 125 basis points, driven by a 55 basis point decrease in gross margin and a 70 basis point increase in SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin contracted primarily from higher product costs, distribution center costs and shrink. These were partially offset by lower freight and sales leverage and occupancy cost.  \n SG&A expenses expanded principally from store labor investments, minimum wage increases and facility costs. These were partially offset by sales leverage.  \n Family Dollar's net sales increased by 3.9% to $3.3 billion. Operating income declined $47.9 million to a loss of $66.3 million. Operating margin compressed 140 basis points on a 20 basis point increase in gross margin and a 160 basis point increase in SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin increased primarily from lower freight, partially offset by higher shrink, markdowns related to the OTC recall and sales mix. SG&A expenses increased primarily from labor investments, minimum wage increases, facility costs, costs related to the OTC recall and depreciation.  \n Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. As a reminder, my comments reflect balance sheet comparisons between Q3 2023 and Q3 2022. Inventory decreased by 2.5%. As we work through our shipments of seasonal imports, we expect a meaningful improvement in our inventory position by year-end.\n Third quarter capital expenditures were $541.4 million versus $391.2 million, reflecting elevated investments in new store openings, renovations, supply chain and IT. Free cash flow improved $142.1 million versus the third quarter last year. This improvement comes despite a challenging macro environment and the accelerated investments to support our multiyear growth strategy.\n For the 9 months of 2023, free cash flow improved $299.1 million versus the same period last year, led largely by lower merchandise inventories, with a partial offset from lower net income adjusted for noncash items, increased CapEx and the timing of accounts payable.\n In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares for $252.3 million, including applicable excise tax. At quarter end, we had $1.35 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $444.6 million compared to $439 million.  \n You'll recall last quarter, we announced our new commercial paper program as an additional source of liquidity to manage our working capital needs. At quarter end, we had $230 million outstanding under this program. \n During the third quarter, we also implemented a new supply chain finance program. Participation in this program is voluntary for our suppliers and provides them with additional flexibility to finance payments due from Dollar Tree. This process will be managed by a third-party financial institution. At quarter end, our leverage, as defined under our revolving credit agreement, was 2.53x. \n Now let me provide some perspective into our sales and EPS expectations for the fourth quarter and its impact on our full-year outlook. \n Our outlook takes into consideration the following factors and expectations: Consistent with our prior expectations and the patterns we have seen throughout the year, we expect shrink trends will remain unfavorable in the fourth quarter.  Family Dollar comps are expected to remain soft, reflecting the unfavorable macro environment for low-income households, continued discretionary weakness and elevated promotional activity in the market.  \n On the plus side, we expect continued strength at the Dollar Tree banner as consumers embrace our compelling value proposition and multi-price strategy in addition to incremental freight savings. \n With that background, we expect net sales for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion, based on low single-digit increase in comp store sales for the enterprise, supported by a mid-single-digit increase at Dollar Tree and a minus 1% to plus 1% comp at Family Dollar.\n As a reminder, last year's Family Dollar comp accelerated meaningfully throughout the year, most notably in the back half as we began our price and labor investments and launched our transformation initiatives. Our Family Dollar comp results for Q3 and outlook for Q4 reflect these tougher comparisons.  \n We estimate fourth quarter diluted EPS will be in the range of $2.58 to $2.78. For the fiscal year, which includes a 53rd week, we expect sales in the range of $30.5 billion to $30.7 billion, driven by a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales at the enterprise level, supported by a mid-single-digit comp at Dollar Tree and a low single-digit comp at Family Dollar.  \n With respect to EPS, we believe that higher sales at Dollar Tree, incremental savings and freight and proactive expense controls will allow us to offset lower revenue expectations at Family Dollar. We are tightening our full-year GAAP EPS outlook to a range of $5.81 to $6.01, including the $0.12 legal reserve we took in the first quarter. We still expect selling square footage to grow by 3% to 3.5% for the year and new store growth to be back-end weighted.  \n Other considerations in our 2023 outlook include the following: No incremental share repurchases. Depreciation and amortization should be in the range of $840 million to $845 million. Net interest expense should be approximately $30 million for the fourth quarter or approximately $110 million for the full year. We are assuming an effective tax rate of approximately 24% for the fourth quarter and approximately 23.5% for the full year.\n We expect 218.4 million diluted shares for the fourth quarter and 220 million diluted shares for the full year. We expect capital expenditures will total approximately $2 billion, with approximately 40% allocated towards maintenance CapEx and the balance toward growth initiatives.\n Finally, our Q4 and full-year outlook does not include any potential impact from the optimization review of the Family Dollar portfolio that Rick outlined in his remarks. We expect the review process will take several months, and we will update you on our progress no later than our Q4 call in March.  \n Now, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for closing remarks. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Jeff. Similar to other retailers you've heard from this earnings season, we are seeing more macro pressures than we did earlier in the year, particularly among our lower-income consumers. Nonetheless, I'm encouraged by our market share momentum and am confident in our outlook for the balance of the year. \n Across our enterprise, we are making good progress on our transformation initiatives. As I've said before, we benchmark our operating performance on growing traffic, units and sales per square foot. All three of these metrics are heading in the right direction. \n With the steps we're taking to optimize our Family Dollar portfolio, we want to be better positioned to meet the financial and operating objectives of our organization and the expectations of our valued customers and associates. \n Relative to our competition, we want to operate from a position of strength at both banners. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the months ahead. \n And since we're in the midst of the important holiday season, I also want to take this opportunity to thank our more than 200,000 associates for their dedication in support of our continued growth as an organization. \n Operator, with that, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. \nMichael Lasser: It's a two-part question. Number one is, given the economic environment that you're facing, seems to be different than what you expected when you offered your long-term guidance earlier this year, how does that influence your thinking about your ability to achieve $10 of earnings by 2026 if the economic environment that is current to date remains the case for the next few years? \n And the second point is -- my second question is there's a perception that you're going to earn, call it, around $6 this year. You get $1 of freight benefit next year. And that would generate $7 of earnings. What would stand in the way of you not realizing that? \nRichard Dreiling: I'm going to let Jeff handle that. \nJeffrey Davis: I appreciate your question. The first part of your question regarding the longer-term outlook, the economic environment that we're in today, we believe that we're managing through. You see the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar continue to take market share, they're doing well across consumables. \n We believe that many of the actions that we're still sort of developing and will be put into action as we go through the fourth quarter into next year will help improve our top line, especially with a customer who is looking for additional value opportunities. \n This is -- we're early in the transformation. We believe that the actions we're taking that we feel strongly will continue to move us forward to our longer-term outlook. There's a lot that's going to happen between now and 2026, and there really isn't a real crystal ball there, but we remain resolute in our outlook. \n As it relates to 2024, I think that the way you're thinking about this from a standpoint on a sort of pro forma no growth, no incremental basis, yes, $7 of EPS when you take all the puts and takes between our forecast for this year. Remember, you've got to back up the 53rd week, which is about $0.30 in that. But we feel that that's a good starting point as you think about our 2024 outlook. \n We remain very confident in our ability to pick up the additional dollar in freight and EPS. There may be some additional upside to that, based upon what we're currently trending. And the actions that we're taking and the returns that we believe we will get from the initiatives that we've started this year will continue to develop as we move forward, that's a good starting point for you. \nRichard Dreiling: And Michael, let me add a little more thoughts on getting the 2026 number. We remain very bullish on that. And I think as we look into 2024, what's important is the number of initiatives that we've gotten done in just 1 year are really starting to gain traction. .\n And let's not lose sight of the fact why the fact that discretionary sales are softer than we all want our consumable sales are excellent, and we're responding to the needs of the consumer. \n And when we have the items they want, they're going to come into the store and see the incremental items, the incremental price points on the Dollar Tree side. They're going to see the new shelf profile, and they're going to see the fact that we're more relevant. And that's what gives me great confidence as we look into '24 and beyond. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: It's a little follow-up to the prior question and then maybe a slight second part. If we take again the $1 in freight, should we think about next year, again, without talking about real guidance, the core business should grow plus we get freight? Or you're not endorsing that the core business necessarily grows as we get freight for sure? \n And then just the second part of it is on Family Dollar, can you remind us if the crux of generating higher margins to sales productivity, then what's going to be the step-change? And when should that occur? \nJeffrey Davis: Want to take the first part? \nRichard Dreiling: You take the freight, and I'll take the second one. \nJeffrey Davis: Very good. I think, and the way I was trying to respond to Michael's point from a standpoint of what's the starting point for FY '24 as he was kind of putting together the components, if you assume once again -- I think the view is looking at -- assuming a no growth, no incremental investment year, you would be starting off with a point that would be roughly $6.80 to $7 of EPS, assuming where we believe we'll end this year plus the additional dollar of freight and then once again, the other puts and takes around the 53rd week, which comes off as well as some of those discrete items we had this year as it relates to West Memphis, OTC and general liability. \n But we believe that we will have the opportunity to grow our business from there. We're not giving guidance for 2024 as of yet. But I think that people are focused on the right components that get you to a starting point and then what your assumptions are based upon how you think our initiatives will continue to take hold and grow from there. \nRichard Dreiling: And then in regards to Family Dollar and when we should start to see the incremental margin, I think as I reflect on where we're at right now, you think about the incremental SKUs, of which the bulk are OTC and HBA, which all carry higher margin rates, now they tend to be a little more discretionary. .\n You think about the fact that now private label -- we've already reached our 14%, which carries massive incremental margin. All of that stuff is going to be in place as we roll into 2024, which, again, gives me a lot of comfort on how Family Dollar is going to perform next year. \n There's no doubt there's pressure on that consumer. But I've always said the lower-income consumer has the ability to figure it out. And we are offering a better value proposition in Family Dollar than it has ever had. I'm very, very comfortable with the way the box looks, the way it's presented and how the consumer is responding. \n And I would add that when we entered quarter 3, the first period of the quarter, our comps were very good in Family Dollar, and we watched them [ erode ] through the period -- through the quarter. So again, we entered it from a very strong position. \nOperator: Next question is coming from Paul Lejuez from Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Can you talk about your Family Dollar comp assumption 4Q, just how you're thinking about how it breaks down from a traffic versus ticket perspective? \n And then within ticket, AUR versus [ BT ]? I'm curious if you can make any comments about your inflation assumptions for 4Q and FY '24? \nJeffrey Davis: Paul, I guess the way we think about it, we really -- the balance of the comp has really been between ticket and traffic. It's been pretty consistent in its makeup. It's been around 50-50. What we've seen here more recently is ticket has dropped off as that customer has been a little more challenged. \n We're continuing to see that going into the fourth quarter, thus our guidance of down 1% to plus 1%. We're not prepared to start getting into AUR and other further -- [ by-section ] of it. But as we think about traffic and ticket, it's going to -- we think we're going to have traffic probably driving more of the comp, offset by some ticket pressure. \nRichard Dreiling: And Paul, I'd like to add to that, that I -- we look -- we are intently focused on three key metrics: Transactions, traffic, whatever you want to call it, unit growth and sales per square footage -- square foot. And those are the things that we want to report on because I believe that drives comp sales and ultimately, growth in the chain. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: I wanted to ask you, I guess, a two-part question around Dollar Tree -- the core Dollar Tree business. You continue to roll out new price points. Maybe just an update on where you think the evolution of that is going over time? And how we should think about the timing of rollout of those price points? \n And then, that concept generally, it does like it's developing into a very formidable traditional dollar store competitor. I'm curious as to where you think you're gaining the share from? Is there any impact in Family Dollar, given what is happening there? And how is the evolution of the concept impacting the way you think about growth, both number of units and where those units may go? \nRichard Dreiling: Great question. Let's start with the price points. We have Rick McNeely and his team have done an outstanding job of introducing new price points. And you have to remember, Ed, we have to buy these things almost a year in advance in order to get them into the stores. And we're starting to see them arrive. We've actually done a test on Halloween and a number of stores with multi-price candy, and we're really, really excited with what happened with that.\n Now, it's really important that -- and I've said this frequently, I don't want anyone to think there's going to be 100 different price points in that store. We're going to -- our core price point is still $1.25. And what we're working on, what is the right amount and right number of price points. \n And what I can tell you is the consumer is -- it is -- when we broke the $1.25 a year ago, I have to tell you that, that barrier was broken, and now the consumer is very receptive to what's going on. \n And when we added an incremental price point, Rick and his team were not adding $1.25 item that's a little bit bigger or a little different at $2. We're adding a different item that has even more value. So there's no SKU overlap, which makes us a little more harder to get executed. \n Now we've already done the work. I know what it's going to take to get items into the store, get them marked, priced properly. 40% of our SKUs are coming from overseas, and they're going to add the price point right on the product. So a lot of great work has been done. And I think that's some of what we're seeing is the -- with the multi pricing, we've been able to make the brand more relevant to more people. \n And I know it's hard, but the consumable side and the way the team reacted to that, I think, has also proved positive that we're attracting a different customer segment. \n Now in regards to future store growth, we are weighing right now, what is the proper mix between Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. Obviously, the Dollar Trees become very profitable very fast, and it appears that we've broadened the demographic appeal of that brand. And I've said this, a well-run Dollar Tree is a pretty powerful retail format. And it's a format that a lot of people would shop in. \n And the fact that we're getting our arms on the price points, the fact that we're getting our arms around our store standards is putting us in a position where that brand might be -- we might be able to go to different areas that we've historically stayed away from. \n In regards to is it affecting Family Dollar, I would look at you and say, those are two different customer segments. The first thing we did when we got together as a team is realized that the go-to-market strategies for both brands are totally different. \n One is the thrill of the treasure hunt in and out, if you run out, I should have bought more versus Family Dollar, which is traditional consumable retailing, where there's an expectation of what has to be in that store, and it's got to be there every time I come in to get it. \nJeffrey Davis: And Ed, just to add, in the prepared comments, we had mentioned the fact that a lot of the growth that's happening in Dollar Tree is actually coming from that higher-income customer, where we're attracting 4.3 million new customers on a year-over-year basis. A lot of these customers are in that income demographic of $125,000 or greater, and we're capturing that basket. \nOperator: Next question today is coming from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. \nJohn Heinbockel: Two quick things or -- maybe the first one is not as quick. But on your [ FTL ] review, can you talk philosophically, right, how you're going to attack that? Because on the one hand, you'd want to dedicate more resources to the stores that have the most potential, but you also don't want to cut back too far from a descaling or deleverage perspective. So maybe talk about that, the opportunity to convert all of those to Dollar Tree. Does that exist? \n And then my small follow-up is just remind us when you think you'll get to eight cooler doors at $3 to $5 price point at Dollar Tree, is that 2 years out, a year out, 3 years out? When is that? \nRichard Dreiling: Well, let's go with the easy one. The Dollar Tree cooler doors, we should have done within the next couple of years.\n Now the [ FTL ] review, we started off with all of our initiatives and the idea being that we get everything in place and see what stores respond and what don't. And what I do want on this exercise, John, is not everyone to get ahead of me because I do think this is a very healthy thing to do and it's a timely thing to do. \n There will be some stores that will relocate, maybe some stores will close, maybe some stores will rebanner. But I do not have any of that information at this stage of the game. I've always prided myself on being transparent, and all I'm trying to do is tell the world we're taking a look at it. \n And I do think it's prudent. And I do think -- I don't want anyone to misconstrue that I'm not totally behind Family Dollar because I am. And I don't want anyone to think that, that doesn't mean we're not going to grow Family Dollar because I'm not saying that at all. It's simply a matter of reallocating assets to where we think we can be more productive. \nOperator: Next question is coming from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So a couple of questions from my side. Maybe first, Rick, on mid-single-digit comps at the Dollar Tree banner, what do you think is the best breakdown beyond this year to think about between traffic and ticket? At Family Dollar, Rick, what was the comp in October? Have you seen any change in November? \n And then, Jeff, could you just elaborate on what you've seen change in the promotional landscape? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. I mean, let me -- let's start with the promotional landscape, and I'll take that, Jeff, if that's okay, and let you put the color around it. .\n I think the promotional landscape, I have not seen anything irrational at this stage of the game. I would look at you and tell you that we are seeing discretionary items being promoted, which I think is more a reflex against people worried about the inventory they have on hand.\n I will tell you, Thanksgiving being an all-time grocer, historically, you get the right price on turkey, then you make your money on all the grocery items around it. We saw a lot of incredibly well-priced grocery items this year coming out of the big box and the grocery channel, which is a little contrary. And there has been elevated activity on [ CSD ], basically 12 packs. But other than that, there hasn't been a lot out there. \n And then on the first question? \nJeffrey Davis: There was a question regarding the Family Dollar comps. The Family Dollar comps during the course of the quarter, they softened as we went through the quarter. We started off with a nice pace. \n October was the most challenged month of the quarter. And you'll see that, that was across all retail. We were essentially flat in that particular month. And our guidance for Q4 was reflecting the fact that, that has continued to soften for us, and that's the guidance of down 1% to plus 1% for the entire quarter. \nRichard Dreiling: And the one thing I'd add to that, Matt, while we think -- we saw things soften in October, I'm knocking on wood here thank God, we had our initiatives in place because while it softened, it could have been a lot worse. And I'm very pleased how we got ourselves through that quarter. \nOperator: Next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: We wanted to ask specifically about Dollar Tree. We know you noted that you saw a broader range of income shopping at Dollar Tree and it contributed to your Q3 comp growth at the higher end. We wondered with regards to the lower end, just what you're seeing specific to the Dollar Tree banner? \nRichard Dreiling: I would say -- I mean, I would look at you and say, Dollar Tree has always had a broad appeal. And I think what we're seeing, what we're focused on is the fact that we're seeing a trade down in the Dollar Tree. I would say, the customer base is essentially the same. There's been no erosion in the lower-income strata, but the growth, undoubtedly, is coming from the higher income, $125,000 a year. \nJeffrey Davis: I reflect back on this, for Dollar Tree, had a very strong consumable performance but also better than a 1% comp in discretionary and still showing growth on a -- it's a sizable growth on a year-over-year basis in discretionary.\n The lower-end customer -- lower-income customer, we're probably seeing more of their dollar in consumables, which is good because we're continuing to capture units and share there.\n The higher-income customers supporting us in that discretionary as well as in consumable areas with respect to the multi-price also. So it's a combination of both those customers as Thanksgiving has a strong performance across the Dollar Tree banner. \nOperator: Next question is coming from Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: So my question is on Family Dollar. Understandably, there was some weakness with the low-end consumer. But how are you planning to address the softer-than-planned top line at Family Dollar to get it back on track towards mid-single digits? That is a big part of the profitability inflection, so how do you think about your current pricing position relative to your peers? \n And then the second part of that, I know you're not guiding to next year, but philosophically, how best to think about the ability of the banner to drive positive units to offset any potential deflation next year in consumables? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. In regards to the top line, in regards to our pricing position, so first thing I would say, our pricing in Family Dollars as good as it's ever been. And we measure our pricing on a full book basis and what we call key value items. And key value items are the most sensitive items out there. \n And we do these checks every month, and we do them across multiple channels, so big box as well as small box, as well as drug, as well as grocery. And we're very, very comfortable where we're at. We're right around -- right on the mark at 100% in both, which means we have price parity. \n And I believe -- and why we've been in this for a year now, I do believe the consumer is starting to respond to that. And remember, we had very powerful consumable growth in quarter 3 in the Family Dollar brand. It's the consumable side where that consumer is feeling that pressure. \n And I think you asked me a little bit about deflation. I would look at you and say, deflation will put us in a position where I think the consumer would be able to afford more discretionary items. So we'll take it as it comes. And of course, it should help us with our margin at the same time. \nJeffrey Davis: Just to add one final point. With respect to the work that Larry and his team is doing in private brands is something that's really important for us. The ability to drive greater value for that customer, give [ her ] other options, this is something that we're really just fully getting implemented here in the fourth quarter, going into '24. \n So we believe that as that customer is looking for greater value, they have more options within our private brands. It's an opportunity for us to improve our margins. And to the extent that there is sort of price deflation, there's opportunity that can actually provide even more value as we think about how we assort that particular product line. \nOperator: Next question today is coming from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: On the Family Dollar store optimization, I'm just curious how, why the comp and profitability gap exists today across the fleet? \n And then I guess this question is more for Jeff. On the gross margin line for the fourth quarter, how should we think about that between each banner, [ FPO ] and the Tree and into 2024? What are the biggest puts and takes to think about? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Chuck, the first question, I would rather not comment at this stage of the game as the process is underway and we have started it. And I will disclose more of that as we get -- when we get into the March call. But let's say this, obviously, it's an opportunity for us that we intend to address head on. \nJeffrey Davis: And then, Chuck, I think your question is around Q4 and as we think about gross margins, let me take it Dollar Tree first. We would expect our margins to continue to expand in gross margins in the fourth quarter, largely driven by additional freight, the mix shift, a stronger mix of discretionary as you would normally have more seasonally. \n The other impact there is that as we had mentioned, we've taken approximately 90% of our inventories, we have the remaining 10%. While we don't expect that remaining 10% to have any different outcomes than we had in the past, the impact on the quarter is much less because you're only talking about a small portion of your inventories on a much larger portion of your overall performance. So our expectation is for further gross margin expansion for Dollar Tree in the fourth quarter. \n We also believe that, that opportunity is there for Family Dollar also for many of the same reasons as it relates to freight, less of an impact of shrink on the quarter as well as some opportunities that we have within distribution. So we'd expect margin expansion -- gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter also for Family Dollar. \nOperator: Next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. \nJosh Young: This is actually Josh Young on for Scot. On the shrink issue, obviously, it's been a big margin headwind this year. As we think about '24, where do you guys think you are in terms of dealing with it? You've talked about some of the mitigation efforts there, but curious if you think we're still in the early innings or do you think you're starting to make some substantial progress on dealing with the problem? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. I would say we're in the early innings, but I do feel we're making headway. The deal is that we take a physical inventory once a year. So if you make these improvements, these adjustments, you still have to wait in order to see them -- see the fruits of your labor. \n Now I can tell you, we've eliminated certain SKUs in certain stores. We've put items behind the check stand counter. We've moved certain items up front, so they have a line of sight to the cashier. And the important thing is we haven't affected our sales. \n And I might also say, we've put in, and I forgot to mention this, an anti-sweep OTC panel that's basically like sliding doors. And you move -- it doesn't lock the counter up, but you move that little door over and you could only pull one item out at a time, which prevents a thief from coming in and cleaning out the whole shelf. \n So we think we're going to make progress. And I don't think it's -- we're going to have to cycle through everything. So it's not like it's going to be an overnight change. but I do believe we're moving in the right direction without having to lock product up. \nOperator: Our final question today is coming from Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. \nPeter Keith: I just want to circle back on the deflation theme because that seems to be something that's percolating out for 2024. Rick, you mentioned your customers have a little bit more money. But is it possible that deflation could be negative for the banners, thinking about maybe less fill-in trips and maybe more competition? \nRichard Dreiling: So on the Dollar Tree side, all it will do is enhance the margin because you basically have a fixed price point, so we end up getting the goods cheaper. So I can say that it could be a benefit. It might have fixed the top line a little, but it should be a benefit. \n To the Family Dollar side, I would look and say it might affect the top line. But again, I can make an argument, it should enhance the margin line. \nJeffrey Davis: It also gives the opportunity for that customer to take those dollars. And our customer today is limiting their purchases, maybe more in consumables, less in discretionary. The additional disposable income that they would have would allow them to pick up an additional discretionary that they didn't have before. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. And again, I'd add, if we do have deflation, it allows us to invest more in the value of the product and actually give the consumer something a little bit additional. \nOperator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you all very much for taking the time, and look forward to talking to you soon. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Richard Dreiling",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. I'd like to welcome everyone joining us on the call today. In brief, thanks to the dedication and hard work of our teams and continued execution towards our business transformation, third quarter results were well within our expected range.  \n In a challenging retail environment where the accumulating pressures of inflation, reduced government benefits and depleted savings have negatively affected lower-income consumers, our top line performance outpaced most of our peers. We accomplished this by taking market share in both segments, which we believe reflects the initial impact of our investments and transformation initiatives. \n Despite Family Dollar softer comps and $0.05 per share of unexpected costs from the previously announced voluntary recall of OTC and other products, we delivered $0.97 of EPS. Our sales momentum continues to be mostly traffic driven as we attract new customers and gain both unit and dollar market share.  \n In the last 12 months, we have added 4.3 million new customers at Dollar Tree and 2.3 million new customers at Family Dollar. Importantly, most of these first-time customers come back to shop with us multiple times after their first visit. In fact, our loyal customers are now the third largest retail customer base in the United States.  \n As importantly, Dollar Tree is attracting customers from a broader range of income levels. Most of our new customers over the past year have household incomes over $125,000, and this income demographic was a significant contributor to Dollar Tree's quarter 3 comp growth.\n At Family Dollar, our price value perception remains strong after last year's price investments, which we cycled in July. That said, Family Dollar fell short of our quarter 3 comp expectations.  \n Similar to what other retailers have reported, we experienced softening trends throughout the quarter, particularly in October. As lower-income consumers responded to the accumulated impact of inflation and reduced government benefits, we saw a notable pullback in spending, particularly in higher-margin discretionary categories.  \n I will now review some of our third quarter highlights. For the third quarter, consolidated basis, we delivered a 5.4% increase in our net sales to $7.3 billion. This was driven by comp growth of 3.9%, with traffic up 4.7% and average ticket down a little less than 1%. Operating income came in at $301.7 million, which resulted in EPS of $0.97, including the negative $0.05 impact from the OTC recall.  \n In the Dollar Tree segment, our comp was up 5.4%, with traffic increasing by 7% and average ticket decreasing by 1.5%. We are especially pleased with these results as they come on top of an 8.6% comp last year.  \n Our consumables comp was up 11.1%, and discretionary was up 1.1%. We believe the consumables strength at Dollar Tree this quarter as well as our strong multiyear discretionary comp shows customers are embracing our compelling value proposition in this strained economic environment.  \n According to Nielsen, Dollar Tree gained an impressive [ 30 ] basis points of consumables market share in the third quarter as our unit volume grew 6%, while market unit volume declined.  \n In the Family Dollar segment, our comp was up 2%, with traffic increasing 1.4% and average ticket increasing 0.7%. Our consumable comp was especially strong at 6.2%, while discretionary was down meaningfully at 12.5%, particularly in categories like home decor, electronics and toys.  \n In our view, these trends underscore how lower-income households are under increasing financial stress and directing their spending towards needs-based goods.  \n While traffic and ticket were both positive for the quarter, results did soften substantially as we moved through the quarter, with average ticket turning negative in October as our customers pulled back and we realized the adverse impact of the OTC recall. Even with these external challenges, Family Dollar grew market share in consumables, with both unit and dollar growth exceeding the market by wide margins.  \n Although our low prices enable us to operate from a position of strength in consumables, our lower-income customers at Family Dollar have been especially pressured by reductions in government SNAP benefits. Nationwide, third quarter SNAP benefits were down 23% on a year-over-year basis, which was much more than the 5% reduction in quarter 1 or the 16% reduction in quarter 2.  \n Timing-wise, the month-by-month deceleration in our quarter 3 comps matched the progressive reductions in national SNAP payments throughout the quarter.  \n In addition to pressure from lower SNAP payments, Family Dollar's comps were negatively affected by lower tax refunds this year. That said, I believe that the wide range of growth initiatives we have in place will help us maintain our momentum relative to the competition.  \n As a value retailer, we're uniquely positioned to meet customers' needs in a challenging economic environment. We remain focused on the factors that we can control, and we'll continue to navigate as best we can around those that we don't.  \n Now let me take a few minutes to update you on our transformation journey. Our merchandising, IT and supply chain initiatives are on time and on budget, and we are pleased with our progress to date. \n At Dollar Tree, we're ahead of schedule on our multi-price journey. Our Dollar Tree Plus assortment is now available in 4,500 stores, and we are on track to finish the year with more than 4,900. Our Dollar Tree frozen and refrigerated assortments are now in 6,500 stores, significantly ahead of our original year-end target of 5,500. \n Customers are clearly responding to our expanded multi-price assortment as our research shows us that 17% of U.S. households have purchased a multi-price product from a Dollar Tree store at least once in the past 12 months. Importantly, these customers are adding multi-price products on top of their traditional baskets. For example, in quarter 3, the average multi-price basket included 2.3 multi-priced items and 11.6 traditional $1.25 items.  \n At Family Dollar, we completed our planogram resets by November as scheduled, improving and expanding our product assortment while increasing our shelf profile and merchandising to [ 78 ] inches across the portfolio. We're on track to renovate more than 1,000 Family Dollar stores by year-end. We have now upgraded 1,600 Family Dollar stores to our H 2.5 rural and extra-small box formats.  \n In quarter 3, private brand penetration at Family Dollar reached 14%, a quarter ahead of schedule, and we are on pace to hit our 20% target by 2026. We are also on track to add over 70 new SKUs to our Family Wellness product line and more than 100 new private brand SKUs in total by the end of December. Within that same time frame, we also expect to complete our conversion of 300 control brands to private brands.  \n In real estate, we opened 197 new stores in quarter 3, and we are on track to meet our target of 600 to 650 new stores this year.  \n In supply chain, we are preparing to implement our streamlined delivery process for stores serviced by our Matthews, North Carolina distribution center with roto carts and liftgate trailers starting next month. We have been testing our roto carts, and the feedback has been extremely positive. We remain on schedule for all of our distribution centers to be using roto carts by the end of 2027.  \n Across our teams, the investments we've made in our people, including increased wages in key markets, simplified work at the store level and increased communications throughout the company, are driving meaningful improvements in store turnover and associate satisfaction. \n Additionally, as we prepared for our busiest season of the year, I'm proud to report that our annual National Hiring Day in mid-October was a huge success. We hired nearly 14,000 part-time associates to work in our stores for the current holiday season, an all-time record for this event. \n While we still have a lot of work to do in this transformational journey, I am pleased with what we've accomplished to date. We are focused on our plans to accelerate sales and grow earnings, and I remain confident in our ability to execute this ambitious undertaking.  \n That said, this journey also needs to be dynamic and adapt to changing market conditions and our learnings along the way. We believe being thoughtful about our store portfolio will help enhance our results. \n To maximize value creation, we need to periodically reevaluate our portfolio in terms of current market conditions, individual store performance and overall portfolio considerations. To this end, we have initiated a comprehensive review of our Family Dollar portfolio to address underperforming stores that are not aligned with our transformative vision for the company. \n This will involve, among other things, identifying stores as candidates for closure, rebannering or relocation with the goal of ensuring that each assets under the Family Dollar banner is delivering its full value for our shareholders on a sustainable basis.  \n I am a strong believer in the Family Dollar brand and what it means to our customers and associates in thousands of communities across the country. Going forward, we need to ensure that the Family Dollar portfolio is well positioned for success and meets the financial and operating objectives of our organization and the expectations of our valued customers and associates. We believe that this action will fortify our base, strengthen our brand and allow Family Dollar to achieve its full growth potential.  \n Jeff will now review our financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Thank you, Jeff. Similar to other retailers you've heard from this earnings season, we are seeing more macro pressures than we did earlier in the year, particularly among our lower-income consumers. Nonetheless, I'm encouraged by our market share momentum and am confident in our outlook for the balance of the year. \n Across our enterprise, we are making good progress on our transformation initiatives. As I've said before, we benchmark our operating performance on growing traffic, units and sales per square foot. All three of these metrics are heading in the right direction. \n With the steps we're taking to optimize our Family Dollar portfolio, we want to be better positioned to meet the financial and operating objectives of our organization and the expectations of our valued customers and associates. \n Relative to our competition, we want to operate from a position of strength at both banners. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the months ahead. \n And since we're in the midst of the important holiday season, I also want to take this opportunity to thank our more than 200,000 associates for their dedication in support of our continued growth as an organization. \n Operator, with that, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions. I'm going to let Jeff handle that. And Michael, let me add a little more thoughts on getting the 2026 number. We remain very bullish on that. And I think as we look into 2024, what's important is the number of initiatives that we've gotten done in just 1 year are really starting to gain traction. .\n And let's not lose sight of the fact why the fact that discretionary sales are softer than we all want our consumable sales are excellent, and we're responding to the needs of the consumer. \n And when we have the items they want, they're going to come into the store and see the incremental items, the incremental price points on the Dollar Tree side. They're going to see the new shelf profile, and they're going to see the fact that we're more relevant. And that's what gives me great confidence as we look into '24 and beyond. You take the freight, and I'll take the second one. And then in regards to Family Dollar and when we should start to see the incremental margin, I think as I reflect on where we're at right now, you think about the incremental SKUs, of which the bulk are OTC and HBA, which all carry higher margin rates, now they tend to be a little more discretionary. .\n You think about the fact that now private label -- we've already reached our 14%, which carries massive incremental margin. All of that stuff is going to be in place as we roll into 2024, which, again, gives me a lot of comfort on how Family Dollar is going to perform next year. \n There's no doubt there's pressure on that consumer. But I've always said the lower-income consumer has the ability to figure it out. And we are offering a better value proposition in Family Dollar than it has ever had. I'm very, very comfortable with the way the box looks, the way it's presented and how the consumer is responding. \n And I would add that when we entered quarter 3, the first period of the quarter, our comps were very good in Family Dollar, and we watched them [ erode ] through the period -- through the quarter. So again, we entered it from a very strong position. And Paul, I'd like to add to that, that I -- we look -- we are intently focused on three key metrics: Transactions, traffic, whatever you want to call it, unit growth and sales per square footage -- square foot. And those are the things that we want to report on because I believe that drives comp sales and ultimately, growth in the chain. Great question. Let's start with the price points. We have Rick McNeely and his team have done an outstanding job of introducing new price points. And you have to remember, Ed, we have to buy these things almost a year in advance in order to get them into the stores. And we're starting to see them arrive. We've actually done a test on Halloween and a number of stores with multi-price candy, and we're really, really excited with what happened with that.\n Now, it's really important that -- and I've said this frequently, I don't want anyone to think there's going to be 100 different price points in that store. We're going to -- our core price point is still $1.25. And what we're working on, what is the right amount and right number of price points. \n And what I can tell you is the consumer is -- it is -- when we broke the $1.25 a year ago, I have to tell you that, that barrier was broken, and now the consumer is very receptive to what's going on. \n And when we added an incremental price point, Rick and his team were not adding $1.25 item that's a little bit bigger or a little different at $2. We're adding a different item that has even more value. So there's no SKU overlap, which makes us a little more harder to get executed. \n Now we've already done the work. I know what it's going to take to get items into the store, get them marked, priced properly. 40% of our SKUs are coming from overseas, and they're going to add the price point right on the product. So a lot of great work has been done. And I think that's some of what we're seeing is the -- with the multi pricing, we've been able to make the brand more relevant to more people. \n And I know it's hard, but the consumable side and the way the team reacted to that, I think, has also proved positive that we're attracting a different customer segment. \n Now in regards to future store growth, we are weighing right now, what is the proper mix between Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. Obviously, the Dollar Trees become very profitable very fast, and it appears that we've broadened the demographic appeal of that brand. And I've said this, a well-run Dollar Tree is a pretty powerful retail format. And it's a format that a lot of people would shop in. \n And the fact that we're getting our arms on the price points, the fact that we're getting our arms around our store standards is putting us in a position where that brand might be -- we might be able to go to different areas that we've historically stayed away from. \n In regards to is it affecting Family Dollar, I would look at you and say, those are two different customer segments. The first thing we did when we got together as a team is realized that the go-to-market strategies for both brands are totally different. \n One is the thrill of the treasure hunt in and out, if you run out, I should have bought more versus Family Dollar, which is traditional consumable retailing, where there's an expectation of what has to be in that store, and it's got to be there every time I come in to get it. Well, let's go with the easy one. The Dollar Tree cooler doors, we should have done within the next couple of years.\n Now the [ FTL ] review, we started off with all of our initiatives and the idea being that we get everything in place and see what stores respond and what don't. And what I do want on this exercise, John, is not everyone to get ahead of me because I do think this is a very healthy thing to do and it's a timely thing to do. \n There will be some stores that will relocate, maybe some stores will close, maybe some stores will rebanner. But I do not have any of that information at this stage of the game. I've always prided myself on being transparent, and all I'm trying to do is tell the world we're taking a look at it. \n And I do think it's prudent. And I do think -- I don't want anyone to misconstrue that I'm not totally behind Family Dollar because I am. And I don't want anyone to think that, that doesn't mean we're not going to grow Family Dollar because I'm not saying that at all. It's simply a matter of reallocating assets to where we think we can be more productive. Yes. I mean, let me -- let's start with the promotional landscape, and I'll take that, Jeff, if that's okay, and let you put the color around it. .\n I think the promotional landscape, I have not seen anything irrational at this stage of the game. I would look at you and tell you that we are seeing discretionary items being promoted, which I think is more a reflex against people worried about the inventory they have on hand.\n I will tell you, Thanksgiving being an all-time grocer, historically, you get the right price on turkey, then you make your money on all the grocery items around it. We saw a lot of incredibly well-priced grocery items this year coming out of the big box and the grocery channel, which is a little contrary. And there has been elevated activity on [ CSD ], basically 12 packs. But other than that, there hasn't been a lot out there. \n And then on the first question? And the one thing I'd add to that, Matt, while we think -- we saw things soften in October, I'm knocking on wood here thank God, we had our initiatives in place because while it softened, it could have been a lot worse. And I'm very pleased how we got ourselves through that quarter. I would say -- I mean, I would look at you and say, Dollar Tree has always had a broad appeal. And I think what we're seeing, what we're focused on is the fact that we're seeing a trade down in the Dollar Tree. I would say, the customer base is essentially the same. There's been no erosion in the lower-income strata, but the growth, undoubtedly, is coming from the higher income, $125,000 a year. Yes. In regards to the top line, in regards to our pricing position, so first thing I would say, our pricing in Family Dollars as good as it's ever been. And we measure our pricing on a full book basis and what we call key value items. And key value items are the most sensitive items out there. \n And we do these checks every month, and we do them across multiple channels, so big box as well as small box, as well as drug, as well as grocery. And we're very, very comfortable where we're at. We're right around -- right on the mark at 100% in both, which means we have price parity. \n And I believe -- and why we've been in this for a year now, I do believe the consumer is starting to respond to that. And remember, we had very powerful consumable growth in quarter 3 in the Family Dollar brand. It's the consumable side where that consumer is feeling that pressure. \n And I think you asked me a little bit about deflation. I would look at you and say, deflation will put us in a position where I think the consumer would be able to afford more discretionary items. So we'll take it as it comes. And of course, it should help us with our margin at the same time. Yes. Chuck, the first question, I would rather not comment at this stage of the game as the process is underway and we have started it. And I will disclose more of that as we get -- when we get into the March call. But let's say this, obviously, it's an opportunity for us that we intend to address head on. Yes. I would say we're in the early innings, but I do feel we're making headway. The deal is that we take a physical inventory once a year. So if you make these improvements, these adjustments, you still have to wait in order to see them -- see the fruits of your labor. \n Now I can tell you, we've eliminated certain SKUs in certain stores. We've put items behind the check stand counter. We've moved certain items up front, so they have a line of sight to the cashier. And the important thing is we haven't affected our sales. \n And I might also say, we've put in, and I forgot to mention this, an anti-sweep OTC panel that's basically like sliding doors. And you move -- it doesn't lock the counter up, but you move that little door over and you could only pull one item out at a time, which prevents a thief from coming in and cleaning out the whole shelf. \n So we think we're going to make progress. And I don't think it's -- we're going to have to cycle through everything. So it's not like it's going to be an overnight change. but I do believe we're moving in the right direction without having to lock product up. So on the Dollar Tree side, all it will do is enhance the margin because you basically have a fixed price point, so we end up getting the goods cheaper. So I can say that it could be a benefit. It might have fixed the top line a little, but it should be a benefit. \n To the Family Dollar side, I would look and say it might affect the top line. But again, I can make an argument, it should enhance the margin line. Yes. And again, I'd add, if we do have deflation, it allows us to invest more in the value of the product and actually give the consumer something a little bit additional. Thank you all very much for taking the time, and look forward to talking to you soon."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments, both generated higher levels of customer traffic, unit volume and increased market share. Overall, we generated 5% more gross profit dollars in the third quarter than we did last year as consumers continue to respond positively to our growth initiatives. \n Consistent with prior-quarter trends, sales mix continued to shift towards consumables. This trend was more pronounced at Family Dollar, where our third quarter consumables mix reached an all-time high of 82%.  \n Looking at the business on a consolidated basis, net sales increased 5.4% to $7.3 billion. Operating income declined 20.9% to $301.7 million. Operating margin compressed 140 basis points, which was a substantial trend improvement versus the first 2 quarters of the year. The contraction in Q3 operating margin was driven by a 15 basis point decrease in gross margin and a 125 basis point increase in SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin contracted primarily from higher shrink, unfavorable product mix, increased distribution costs and markdowns from the OTC recall. This was partially offset by lower freight costs.  \n While still elevated across both banners, shrink results were mostly in line with our expectations. We have now completed physical inventory checks across more than 90% of our stores, with a balance set for completion in January.  \n SG&A expenses expanded primarily from ongoing labor investments in our stores, IT costs, depreciation and facility costs. Our effective tax rate was 21.8% versus 23.4%. Our tax rate was favorable versus expectations as higher work opportunity tax credits and lower net state taxes were partially offset by higher nondeductible expenses.  \n Net income was $212 million, and diluted EPS was $0.97 versus $1.20. The net impact of the OTC recall was approximately $0.05 per share.\n At the business segment level, Dollar Tree's net sales increased by 6.6% to $4 billion. Operating income declined 3.4% to $482.7 million. And operating margin compressed approximately 125 basis points, driven by a 55 basis point decrease in gross margin and a 70 basis point increase in SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin contracted primarily from higher product costs, distribution center costs and shrink. These were partially offset by lower freight and sales leverage and occupancy cost.  \n SG&A expenses expanded principally from store labor investments, minimum wage increases and facility costs. These were partially offset by sales leverage.  \n Family Dollar's net sales increased by 3.9% to $3.3 billion. Operating income declined $47.9 million to a loss of $66.3 million. Operating margin compressed 140 basis points on a 20 basis point increase in gross margin and a 160 basis point increase in SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin increased primarily from lower freight, partially offset by higher shrink, markdowns related to the OTC recall and sales mix. SG&A expenses increased primarily from labor investments, minimum wage increases, facility costs, costs related to the OTC recall and depreciation.  \n Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. As a reminder, my comments reflect balance sheet comparisons between Q3 2023 and Q3 2022. Inventory decreased by 2.5%. As we work through our shipments of seasonal imports, we expect a meaningful improvement in our inventory position by year-end.\n Third quarter capital expenditures were $541.4 million versus $391.2 million, reflecting elevated investments in new store openings, renovations, supply chain and IT. Free cash flow improved $142.1 million versus the third quarter last year. This improvement comes despite a challenging macro environment and the accelerated investments to support our multiyear growth strategy.\n For the 9 months of 2023, free cash flow improved $299.1 million versus the same period last year, led largely by lower merchandise inventories, with a partial offset from lower net income adjusted for noncash items, increased CapEx and the timing of accounts payable.\n In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares for $252.3 million, including applicable excise tax. At quarter end, we had $1.35 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $444.6 million compared to $439 million.  \n You'll recall last quarter, we announced our new commercial paper program as an additional source of liquidity to manage our working capital needs. At quarter end, we had $230 million outstanding under this program. \n During the third quarter, we also implemented a new supply chain finance program. Participation in this program is voluntary for our suppliers and provides them with additional flexibility to finance payments due from Dollar Tree. This process will be managed by a third-party financial institution. At quarter end, our leverage, as defined under our revolving credit agreement, was 2.53x. \n Now let me provide some perspective into our sales and EPS expectations for the fourth quarter and its impact on our full-year outlook. \n Our outlook takes into consideration the following factors and expectations: Consistent with our prior expectations and the patterns we have seen throughout the year, we expect shrink trends will remain unfavorable in the fourth quarter.  Family Dollar comps are expected to remain soft, reflecting the unfavorable macro environment for low-income households, continued discretionary weakness and elevated promotional activity in the market.  \n On the plus side, we expect continued strength at the Dollar Tree banner as consumers embrace our compelling value proposition and multi-price strategy in addition to incremental freight savings. \n With that background, we expect net sales for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion, based on low single-digit increase in comp store sales for the enterprise, supported by a mid-single-digit increase at Dollar Tree and a minus 1% to plus 1% comp at Family Dollar.\n As a reminder, last year's Family Dollar comp accelerated meaningfully throughout the year, most notably in the back half as we began our price and labor investments and launched our transformation initiatives. Our Family Dollar comp results for Q3 and outlook for Q4 reflect these tougher comparisons.  \n We estimate fourth quarter diluted EPS will be in the range of $2.58 to $2.78. For the fiscal year, which includes a 53rd week, we expect sales in the range of $30.5 billion to $30.7 billion, driven by a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales at the enterprise level, supported by a mid-single-digit comp at Dollar Tree and a low single-digit comp at Family Dollar.  \n With respect to EPS, we believe that higher sales at Dollar Tree, incremental savings and freight and proactive expense controls will allow us to offset lower revenue expectations at Family Dollar. We are tightening our full-year GAAP EPS outlook to a range of $5.81 to $6.01, including the $0.12 legal reserve we took in the first quarter. We still expect selling square footage to grow by 3% to 3.5% for the year and new store growth to be back-end weighted.  \n Other considerations in our 2023 outlook include the following: No incremental share repurchases. Depreciation and amortization should be in the range of $840 million to $845 million. Net interest expense should be approximately $30 million for the fourth quarter or approximately $110 million for the full year. We are assuming an effective tax rate of approximately 24% for the fourth quarter and approximately 23.5% for the full year.\n We expect 218.4 million diluted shares for the fourth quarter and 220 million diluted shares for the full year. We expect capital expenditures will total approximately $2 billion, with approximately 40% allocated towards maintenance CapEx and the balance toward growth initiatives.\n Finally, our Q4 and full-year outlook does not include any potential impact from the optimization review of the Family Dollar portfolio that Rick outlined in his remarks. We expect the review process will take several months, and we will update you on our progress no later than our Q4 call in March.  \n Now, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for closing remarks. I appreciate your question. The first part of your question regarding the longer-term outlook, the economic environment that we're in today, we believe that we're managing through. You see the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar continue to take market share, they're doing well across consumables. \n We believe that many of the actions that we're still sort of developing and will be put into action as we go through the fourth quarter into next year will help improve our top line, especially with a customer who is looking for additional value opportunities. \n This is -- we're early in the transformation. We believe that the actions we're taking that we feel strongly will continue to move us forward to our longer-term outlook. There's a lot that's going to happen between now and 2026, and there really isn't a real crystal ball there, but we remain resolute in our outlook. \n As it relates to 2024, I think that the way you're thinking about this from a standpoint on a sort of pro forma no growth, no incremental basis, yes, $7 of EPS when you take all the puts and takes between our forecast for this year. Remember, you've got to back up the 53rd week, which is about $0.30 in that. But we feel that that's a good starting point as you think about our 2024 outlook. \n We remain very confident in our ability to pick up the additional dollar in freight and EPS. There may be some additional upside to that, based upon what we're currently trending. And the actions that we're taking and the returns that we believe we will get from the initiatives that we've started this year will continue to develop as we move forward, that's a good starting point for you. Want to take the first part? Very good. I think, and the way I was trying to respond to Michael's point from a standpoint of what's the starting point for FY '24 as he was kind of putting together the components, if you assume once again -- I think the view is looking at -- assuming a no growth, no incremental investment year, you would be starting off with a point that would be roughly $6.80 to $7 of EPS, assuming where we believe we'll end this year plus the additional dollar of freight and then once again, the other puts and takes around the 53rd week, which comes off as well as some of those discrete items we had this year as it relates to West Memphis, OTC and general liability. \n But we believe that we will have the opportunity to grow our business from there. We're not giving guidance for 2024 as of yet. But I think that people are focused on the right components that get you to a starting point and then what your assumptions are based upon how you think our initiatives will continue to take hold and grow from there. Paul, I guess the way we think about it, we really -- the balance of the comp has really been between ticket and traffic. It's been pretty consistent in its makeup. It's been around 50-50. What we've seen here more recently is ticket has dropped off as that customer has been a little more challenged. \n We're continuing to see that going into the fourth quarter, thus our guidance of down 1% to plus 1%. We're not prepared to start getting into AUR and other further -- [ by-section ] of it. But as we think about traffic and ticket, it's going to -- we think we're going to have traffic probably driving more of the comp, offset by some ticket pressure. And Ed, just to add, in the prepared comments, we had mentioned the fact that a lot of the growth that's happening in Dollar Tree is actually coming from that higher-income customer, where we're attracting 4.3 million new customers on a year-over-year basis. A lot of these customers are in that income demographic of $125,000 or greater, and we're capturing that basket. There was a question regarding the Family Dollar comps. The Family Dollar comps during the course of the quarter, they softened as we went through the quarter. We started off with a nice pace. \n October was the most challenged month of the quarter. And you'll see that, that was across all retail. We were essentially flat in that particular month. And our guidance for Q4 was reflecting the fact that, that has continued to soften for us, and that's the guidance of down 1% to plus 1% for the entire quarter. I reflect back on this, for Dollar Tree, had a very strong consumable performance but also better than a 1% comp in discretionary and still showing growth on a -- it's a sizable growth on a year-over-year basis in discretionary.\n The lower-end customer -- lower-income customer, we're probably seeing more of their dollar in consumables, which is good because we're continuing to capture units and share there.\n The higher-income customers supporting us in that discretionary as well as in consumable areas with respect to the multi-price also. So it's a combination of both those customers as Thanksgiving has a strong performance across the Dollar Tree banner. Just to add one final point. With respect to the work that Larry and his team is doing in private brands is something that's really important for us. The ability to drive greater value for that customer, give [ her ] other options, this is something that we're really just fully getting implemented here in the fourth quarter, going into '24. \n So we believe that as that customer is looking for greater value, they have more options within our private brands. It's an opportunity for us to improve our margins. And to the extent that there is sort of price deflation, there's opportunity that can actually provide even more value as we think about how we assort that particular product line. And then, Chuck, I think your question is around Q4 and as we think about gross margins, let me take it Dollar Tree first. We would expect our margins to continue to expand in gross margins in the fourth quarter, largely driven by additional freight, the mix shift, a stronger mix of discretionary as you would normally have more seasonally. \n The other impact there is that as we had mentioned, we've taken approximately 90% of our inventories, we have the remaining 10%. While we don't expect that remaining 10% to have any different outcomes than we had in the past, the impact on the quarter is much less because you're only talking about a small portion of your inventories on a much larger portion of your overall performance. So our expectation is for further gross margin expansion for Dollar Tree in the fourth quarter. \n We also believe that, that opportunity is there for Family Dollar also for many of the same reasons as it relates to freight, less of an impact of shrink on the quarter as well as some opportunities that we have within distribution. So we'd expect margin expansion -- gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter also for Family Dollar. It also gives the opportunity for that customer to take those dollars. And our customer today is limiting their purchases, maybe more in consumables, less in discretionary. The additional disposable income that they would have would allow them to pick up an additional discretionary that they didn't have before."

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Bob LaFleur, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRobert LaFleur: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Dollar Tree's second quarter results.

Given the number of callers who would like to participate in today's session, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. I'd now like to turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thanks, Bob. I'd like to welcome all of you that have joined our call this morning. I am sure that many of you had a chance to attend our investor conference in June. I hope the information we presented was valuable to you and that you left the event with a better understanding of the key growth strategies that we have in place to deliver $10 or more EPS by 2026.  \n I am confident that the team has identified the right levers to unlock the true value of our business. We are making good progress and continue to act with urgency to accelerate the pace of improvement in our merchandising, store operations, supply chain and IT infrastructure. Our renewed merchandising efforts represent a major opportunity to unlock value. We outlined our multi-price journey at Dollar Tree, detailed our real estate and merchandising initiatives at Family Dollar and reviewed our plans to improve store standards across the enterprise.  \n We have also launched efforts to drive sales productivity and increase operating efficiency like simplifying the truck unloading process and improving in-stock levels. You heard me say many times that retail is all about growing units, growing transactions and growing sales per square foot. When these retail fundamentals move in the right direction, everything else follows.  \n I am pleased to report that all 3 are heading in the right direction for us. For the past 2 quarters, both segments posted positive unit growth in consumables, while the market has been negative. Second quarter traffic was up over 3% at Family Dollar and nearly 10% at Dollar Tree. The fourth consecutive quarter of growth at Family Dollar and the second for Dollar Tree. And finally, sales per square foot is up 4% at Family Dollar and 6% at Dollar Tree.  \n When it comes to our momentum in these key retail fundamentals, our ongoing merchandising efforts and the investments in labor and stores are paying dividends and setting the stage for everything else to follow. \n Now let me review some of our second quarter highlights. A little later, Jeff will provide a more detailed review of our results and update you on our outlook for the balance of the year.  \n For the quarter, on a consolidated basis, we delivered an 8.2% increase in sales to $7.3 billion, with 6.9% enterprise comp growth and $287.8 million of operating income, which led to EPS of $0.91. In our Dollar Tree segment, our 7.8% comp was driven by 9.6% more traffic, with a modest offset from average ticket. Dollar Tree's momentum remained strong with this quarter's comp coming in on top of a 7.5% comp last year.  \n Meanwhile, the Family Dollar segment continues to make good progress in its operational turnaround. The second quarter comp of 5.8% was nicely balanced between 3.4% more traffic and 2.3% average ticket growth with the strong comp trends being supported by our improved price position and merchandising efforts. While the challenging macro environment continues to pressure our sales mix in both segments, I am pleased with the gains in traffic, new customers and market share.  \n Regarding the industry-wide shift in consumer purchasing behaviors to consumables, we believe this is reflective of the current macroeconomic environment and continuing rotation to a prepandemic balance after years of elevated spending across discretionary categories. We believe we are winning in consumables as more customers come to see Dollar Tree and Family Dollar as the compelling destinations for value.  \n At Dollar Tree, our multi-price strategy provides flexibility to respond to changing customer needs. At Family Dollar, our improved price image and wide range of merchandising initiatives are clearly resonating with consumers. In this environment, consumers from all income levels are increasingly seeking value.  \n We are well positioned to capture incremental share of wallet when higher income consumers respond to our strong price value proposition and when lower income customers concentrate their spending on needs-based consumables. This is particularly true across food and other consumables where value-oriented retailers are taking unit and dollar share. As a result, food categories are disproportionately driving sales momentum across the value retail landscape.  \n Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are no exception. Our food business is especially well positioned in the current environment, and we are seeing extremely high volume growth across our frozen and center store food categories. There is also growing evidence that consumers are seeking value through private brands, expanding and improving our private brand assortment will be a significant growth vehicle for us going forward.  \n To this end, the private brand expansion program at Family Dollar remains on track. This year, we launched over 125 private brand items, which we will further accelerate when our new family wellness and vitamin products hit store shelves in the fourth quarter. \n We are already seeing encouraging results across our private brands with second quarter penetration expanding by 55 basis points, units sold growing by 4% and private brand comps increasing over 15%. New customers are the lifeblood of retail and a critical part of driving traffic and market share.  \n In the past year, we have added nearly 5 million new customers across both segments with 2.6 million of these customers having a household income over $125,000. Importantly, our research tells us that a very high percentage of these new customers come back visiting an average of 5x in the year following their initial trip. In fact, we now rank in the top 10 retailers measured by annual new customer activations. These positive traffic and new customer trends are leading to strong market share gains.  \n For the second quarter in a row, both segments gained market share in consumables as our unit volume grew while the market's unit volume shrink. According to Nielsen data, our second quarter consumable unit volume growth outpaced the market by over 1,100 basis points at Dollar Tree and 530 basis points at Family Dollar, with both segments extending their margin of outperformance from last quarter.  \n Shifting from our recent sales performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on several key initiatives across our company. In merchandising, we have increased our Dollar Tree Plus target to 4,900 stores by year-end, up from 4,300 stores that we articulated in June. At the end of the second quarter, our Dollar Tree Plus assortment was available in over 3,600 locations and the $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated assortment was available in nearly 5,600 stores.  \n At Family Dollar, we are on track to complete planogram resets at all of our stores by November, and we are pleased with the sales lift from these resets so far. In real estate, we remain on pace to hit our target of 600 to 650 new store openings this year with roughly 2/3 of those coming in the back half of the year. We also continue to make progress with our emerging formats at Family Dollar.  \n We completed 271 H2.5 renovations bringing the total number of 2.5 locations to 830. We opened or converted 90 Family Dollar stores under our rural combo format. \n Overall, we are on track to complete at least 1,000 Family Dollar renovations by year-end. In supply chain, Mike Kindy and his team are investing in temperature control, across our distribution center network. Adding full temperature control to our DCs improves the work environment for our associates and drives improved operating performance. It also drives efficiency by reducing cross-stocking expenses and increasing flexibility to store the full range of OTC HBA products. We recently expanded temperature controls at 2 additional DCs, which brings us to 4 in total. By year-end, we expect to upgrade 8 additional DCs with the balance rolled out by the end of 2024.  \n While still in its early days, we continue to make good progress on our roto cart rollout. Beta testing on roto cart deliveries is currently underway, and we are on track for our D.C. and Matthews, North Carolina to be roto cart enabled by the end of this year.  \n Moving on to IT. We're also making good progress on needed upgrades to our infrastructure, particularly our new store and inventory management systems. Meanwhile, our new warehouse and transportation management systems are progressing through their development stages with rollouts anticipated to begin early next year.  \n With the continued focus on our people, we saw double-digit improvements during the second quarter in employee turnover and store vacancy levels across both segments as the investments we are making in store level wages, benefits and elevated standards begin to yield clear intangible results. As I mentioned at our investor conference, we had a significant number of stores that don't open on time or close early due to staffing shortages.  \n I'm happy to report that we saw a measurable improvement in this area during the second quarter at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. If we eliminated all 8 openings and early closings, it could add 1.5 points to our overall comp. In summary, when it comes to the factors that we can control, we continue to execute at a high level. As our recent sales performance shows, consumers are clearly responding to our merchandising initiatives.  \n At the same time, Mike Creedon and his team are acting with urgency to upgrade our store conditions and improve operational consistency across our store fleet. We are making the investments we need to make to accelerate our top line performance, generate greater operating efficiencies and improve profitability. We've built a strong cultural foundation as an organization, and we are focused on delivering better results for all our key constituents including our more than 200,000 associates.  \n And speaking of our associates, we've just spent the last 2 weeks meeting with our field leadership at our headquarters here in Virginia. A team of more than 1,300 leaders who represent more than 200,000 associates and the energy coming out of those sessions was amazing. Our people are the key to a great customer experience, and I am so grateful for the progress we've made in our turnaround efforts over such a short period of time.  \n I will now turn the call over to Jeff to review our financial results and outlook for the balance of the year. \nJeffrey Davis: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we continued to generate strong top line results across both segments, driven by growth in customer traffic, unit volume and an accelerating market share. We continue to have a favorable view of the current operating environment. Our top line performance was not driven by any material increase in promotional intensity.  \n While our sales mix continues to shift towards consumables, we generated more gross profit dollars in the second quarter than we did last year. We also remain resolute in our strategy to make the necessary investments in stores, IT, supply chain and our people.  \n On a consolidated level, operating income declined 43.1% to $287.8 million and operating margin compressed by 360 basis points. This was driven by a 220 basis point decrease in gross margin and a 130 basis point increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin contracted primarily from lower merchandise margin as we lap the margin benefit from last year's $1.25 rollout and from unfavorable sales mix, product cost inflation and elevated shrink.  \n SG&A expenses expanded primarily from wage investments, incentive compensation, general liability claims, and repairs and maintenance costs from improving store conditions. These were partially offset by leverage from increased comp sales and lower stock compensation expense.  \n Notably, the impact of general liability claims was $0.07 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 24% versus 24.2% last year as higher work opportunity tax credits were partially offset by higher nondeductible expenses. Net income was $200.4 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.91 versus $1.60 a year ago.  \n At a business segment level, Dollar Tree's operating income declined 27.8% to $397.8 million and operating margin compressed 510 basis points. This was driven by a 400 basis point decline in gross margin and a 110 basis point increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin contracted primarily from lower merchandise margin as we lapped the margin benefit from last year's $1.25 rollout and from unfavorable sales mix, product cost inflation and elevated shrink.  \n These were partially offset by comp sales leverage against occupancy costs. SG&A expenses expanded principally from wage investments, minimum wage increases, general liability claims, utility costs and repair and maintenance costs for improving store conditions. These were partially offset by sales comp leverage.  \n Family Dollar's operating income declined 78.5% to $11.8 million and operating margin compressed 140 basis points. This was led by a 30 basis point decrease in gross margin and 110 basis point increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin contracted primarily from elevated shrink with a partial offset from leveraging occupancy costs.  \n SG&A expenses also increased principally from wage investments, minimum wage increases, utility costs and repairs and maintenance costs from improving store conditions. These were partially offset by sales comp leverage.  \n Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. As a reminder, my comments reflect balance sheet comparisons between Q2 2023 and Q2 2022. Inventory decreased by 1.7%. While inventory was below last year's level, it was elevated due to early receipts of imports. With the rapid recovery across our supply chain, seasonal imports from Asia arrived well ahead of our scheduled third quarter receipts.  \n Moving forward, we will continue to manage our inventory and related trade accounts payable to improve free cash flow generation. Capital expenditures were $425.4 million in the second quarter versus $276.2 million last year. reflecting elevated investment levels in new store openings and renovations, supply chain and information systems.  \n For fiscal 2023, we expect capital expenditures will total approximately $2 billion, with approximately 40% allocated to maintenance CapEx and the balance towards growth initiatives. Free cash flow improved $40.5 million versus the second quarter of last year. This represents the third consecutive quarterly improvement in free cash flow generation, even as we make significant investments to support the long-term growth of the business.  \n For the first 6 months of 2023, free cash flow improved $157 million versus the same period last year, led largely by lower merchandise inventories with a partial offset from lower net income adjusted for noncash items, increased CapEx and the timing of accounts payable. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares for $99.9 million, including applicable excise tax. At quarter end, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.  \n Cash and cash equivalents totaled $512.7 million compared to $688.9 million a year ago. In July, we established a new commercial paper program to issue unsecured notes with maturities up to 397 days with an aggregate face amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion. We expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The notes will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Our revolving credit facility will serve as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of outstanding notes under this program.  \n This new program provides additional flexibility to manage our working capital needs and at current rates, it provides short-term borrowing at lower rates than our credit facility. There are no notes issued and outstanding as of the end of the quarter. Now let me provide some additional visibility into our sales and EPS expectations for the third quarter and the balance of 2023.  \n At a high level, we are reiterating the center point of the full year outlook we gave last quarter and bringing in the high and low end to better reflect the balance of opportunities and risks we see in the current operating environment. Our outlook takes into consideration the following factors: continued shift in sales mix and unfavorable shrink trends over the balance of the year, our utility and repairs and maintenance costs related to the national heat down, higher diesel fuel prices.  \n On the Plus side, we expect improved sales performance and incremental ocean freight savings. That all said, we see nothing systemic or structural in the current environment that would have a lasting negative implications for the multiyear outlook that we shared in June.  \n So against that backdrop, we expect consolidated net sales for the third quarter will be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion. Based on a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales for the enterprise in each of the segments. We estimate third quarter diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $0.94 to $1.04.  \n For the full fiscal year, which includes a 53rd week this year, we are raising our 2023 sales expectations to a range of $30.6 billion to $30.9 billion, driven by a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales across both segments and the full enterprise. Based on better visibility into the margin headwinds I just detailed, we are narrowing our full year diluted GAAP earnings per share outlook to a range of $5.78 to $6.08, including the $0.12 legal reserve we talked in the first quarter.  \n We still expect selling square footage to grow between 3% and 3.5% for the year and new store growth to be back-end weighted. Other considerations in our 2023 outlook include the following: We have not included any assumptions for incremental share repurchases; depreciation and amortization should be in the range of $845 million to $850 million; net interest expense should be approximately $25 million for the third quarter and approximately $110 million for the full year.\n We are assuming an effective tax rate of approximately 23% and for the third quarter and approximately 24% for the full year. We expect 220.6 million diluted shares for the third quarter and 221 million diluted shares for the full year. Our outlook reflects continued margin pressures that we expect to persist through the back half of the year. Based on our continued market share gains at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we are in a good position to generate higher levels of rebates and promotional allowances.  \n We also continue to be disciplined in managing our cost structure, even as we make investments necessary to meet our stated long-term growth objective of $10 or more of EPS by 2026. Now I'll turn the call back over to Rick for closing remarks. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Jeff. We remain very pleased with the progress of our transformation in these early stages and remain confident in the 3-year road map outlined in June. For those of you familiar with my operating philosophy, the immediate focus of any retail turnaround is growing sales. From that perspective, we are succeeding. \n We are providing a new experience to the next generation of customers across both our segments and seeing strong repeat purchase activity from these new shoppers. Our goal is to provide the consumer with convenience, value, variety and a great shopping experience. Our stores are already conveniently located. 87% of the population of the Continental United States lives within a 5-mile radius of one of our stores. \n As we grow our footprint, we will be closer and more convenient to an even greater number of customers. I remain confident that our long-term earnings potential can be realized within the time frame we have communicated. Our improving top line performance places us in a position of strength and the combined impact of our merchandising, real estate, supply chain, IT and people initiatives should put us in an even stronger position relative to the competition. Operator, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mike Lasser from UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So with the knock on the transformation at Dollar Tree has been that it's just going to take a lot more heavy lifting, a lot more investment than what was originally anticipated. And the fact that your sales are trending better than what was expected is a good sign, but it does not seem like the profitability is flowing through. So, a, do you have a good handle right now on all of the ins and outs of the different considerations with the profitability. And b, as you look towards the next 12 months, there's going to be a benefit from lower supply chain costs. Is that going to flow through? Or will you use that as a source of further savings to then reinvest that back in the business to drive the $10 of earnings several years out. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, Mike, 3 really good questions. First off, is the lift heavier than we thought it was going to be. I would say no. When we all got in on this, we knew what we were facing. I do think what we're trying to do, because of what has to be done, we are moving much faster than I thought we would. And when you move fast, it takes a little more expense, it takes a little more effort, it takes a little more push. And so is the lift heavier? No, it's the same. But what we're trying to do is move as fast as we possibly can. \n In regards to the drop-through, I think we are learning to do a lot of things, flexing a lot of muscles that we have not used in the past. The Family Dollar side is all about the commitment you make to the vendor community. And Jeff called out the potential for increased rebates and allowances that's all driven by retail execution. And the Family Dollar people are doing a really terrific job on that. What has happened on the Dollar Tree side, the Dollar Tree people have responded to the change in patterns that the consumer is exhibiting in our store, buying more consumables. \n So I think and I always have subscribed to the fact that when top line starts moving, everything else catches up. I remain incredibly bullish on our margin targets and where we're going. And I do not see any trouble to getting to more realistic margin levels. In regards to the improvements in the supply chain, that will be a combination of both. As you know, we've got massive changes taking place on the supply chain side. Some of that will make it to the bottom line and some of it will invest. And Jeff, I don't know if you have anything you want to add? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. There's a couple of additional items, Michael. We -- as it relates to the flow-through, and we tried to call us out -- it's really a situation where our sales mix is an area that, as you see across the retail landscape, people are moving more into consumables, and that we're not immune to that. The other area that we talked about was shrink and the ongoing progression there. Those are the 2 more significant items from a gross margin basis that are really impacting us and addressing the flow-through or restricting the flow through. \n The other thing that it's kind of muted in our comments, but this past quarter, we had about $0.07 related to an accrual adjustment that we needed to make for the progression of certain general liability claims that really dated back to 2019 and 2020 during the pandemic period. Once again, something that we needed to take care of, but it also restricted the flow through and the tremendous sales that we were driving over the course of the year. So I think that we're seeing right now, we've called out in the past and reason for our adjustment in the overall guidance that we gave last quarter, which was around sales and shrink. And then it was just further exacerbated, unfortunately, with this accrual adjustment we need to make. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: I wanted to dig in on the core Dollar Tree gross margin this quarter. If we think about the 33.4%, it's obviously a step back versus where you were in Q1. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about the incremental pressures? And then how we think about the back half, you had previously talked about a 36%, 37% gross margin for the year. Obviously, that's coming down. So thoughts there. \n And then just as it relates to all of that, how does this inform the longer-term target of 35.5%, 37.5%. It looks like this year, you maybe even below the low end of that range. What does it take to get to the middle end of that range? Do you need the backdrop to normalize demand, obviously you got freight coming in, but I'm not sure shrink is bottomed. Just thoughts around all of that, I think would really be helpful. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Great question again. What's happening in Dollar Tree as we were responding to the needs of the consumer. You go back a year ago, we did not have nearly the number of consumable SKUs that we now have in the store. Saying all that, our discretionary business on the Dollar Tree side was slightly up. But what -- when I think about quarter 3, particularly or quarter 4, we're going to be in a much stronger position on the margin due because of the change in the mix, we think is going to happen. And that's because quarter 4 is a very seasonal quarter for us with Christmas and Halloween and all of that. So I remain bullish on it. I do believe, Ed, that we are responding to the customer and sales takes care of everything eventually, and the 2-year stack in Dollar Tree is just outstanding. So I remain very, very bullish on where we're going with the margin. \nJeffrey Davis: And Ed, the other thing I would add to that, hopefully, I hope don't sound like a broken record here, but -- unfortunately, the headwinds we're having in shrink are muting our margins right now. When you get a chance, you have an opportunity to take a look at the supplemental presentation that we have, you'll see that shrink is continuing to be -- restrict our margins by about 75 to 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We are taking the appropriate actions, we believe in the organization to start to address that. As you know, shrink is a sort of a trailing indication because stores are shrinking over the course of the year. And as you're adding new actions to reduce it, it takes time for those things to actually take hold. But between the sales mix and the shrink once again, this is one of the things that have been muting the margin. \n The other thing that while we are seeing less frequency of product cost increases and maybe the magnitude of those are not as significant. They are still in the marketplace. And Rick McNeely and his team are freeing our ways to work through those through a number of different merchandising actions. So we still have a little bit of headwind there on product cost pressures, which as we move forward, depending on consumer demands, we believe that those will start to -- should start to abate over time. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. \nJohn Heinbockel: Rick, my question is multipart, really revolved around the $3, $4, $5, right, frozen and cooler. So can you maybe talk about the experience you're seeing because that clearly has to be lifting consumable comps. Your thought on the rollout, not just to all stores, but then expanding doors, right, getting to more than 3 doors today. But on the rollout and then the impact that that's having on traffic, that is hitting discretionary, right? And then ultimately, do you think that, that should -- it should hurt gross but the increased ticket, right, should positively impact expense control over time. So maybe your thought on that as it impacts the Dollar Tree P&L? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Another effort that we're working really, really hard on. In regards to the number of cooler doors, we're going to go from 3, I believe, 10 or 12 is the plan. We'll have a door that is a $1.25, couple of doors will be $3, $4, $5, and we're actually looking as we look at the multi-price point to expand that even more. The interesting thing is when a frozen food item goes into the basket, the basket actually gets larger. So your point about driving traffic, driving transactions is spot on. The other interesting thing, when we went to $3, $4 and $5, that allowed us to offer a family serving versus at $1.25, where it's just a single serve. So again, much more appealing to the actual -- to the consumer. \n The other thing, John, the fact that we went to multiple price points allowed us to put ice back in the stores. And ice is always a big seller. When we were locked in on the dollar, we had to take it out and we went to a larger bag, 7 pounds, took it to $2. And again, we're back in the ice business. I also agree that what will happen is we will keep growing sales and allow us to leverage our SG&A down in the stores. \n And then I also want you to think about the fact as we roll roto carts out, that we'll be delivering to the Dollar Tree stores and those also. So all of that time that it takes to unload a truck will be invested in putting more multi-price point items out on the shelves. \nOperator: Next question is coming from Paul Lejuez from Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious if you could talk about the monthly trend for each segment. Also curious to hear about performance in urban versus suburban and rural locations. And anything that you would say in terms of the competitive landscape that you see changing out there from a pricing perspective? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Great question. As I look at the flow across both banners through the quarter, it was pretty consistent all the way through. We started off strong, and it remained strong through the balance of the quarter. \n There -- in terms of performance, I think it's pretty even, but I will make this observation. It appears that the trade down from a higher income customer it's coming more in the urban environment than in the rural environment. So that's -- it's an interesting spin, but it's pretty even all the way across. In regards to the competitive environment out there in regards to pricing, the way I see it, it's very rational right now. Nothing significant is going on. I would say the ad collateral is basically the same it's always been. Everybody's kind of -- I think everybody is on the same playing field right now. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. So maybe a 2-part question, Rick, at the Dollar Tree banner, could you elaborate on the traffic trends? It seems like that's the real positive progression here. Any change in momentum that you've seen in August? And maybe just speak to market share trends that you're seeing by category at Dollar Tree. And then, Jeff, on the expense front, I guess, is there a way to think about the progression of the foundational investments that you've been putting in place as we think maybe beyond this year? It seems like store standards and wages, maybe 2 of the more stickier initiatives. Or maybe just ask differently, what do you see as the comp that we need to leverage fixed costs maybe next year in the model? \nRichard Dreiling: I'll take the first part, Jeff. Matt, the traffic is steadily increasing in Dollar Tree. Our traffic was up 9% in quarter 2. Really, really pleased with that. Your other question is discretionary was still up in Dollar Tree. It was up 3.9%. The consumables though, were up over 11%, which is our way -- and remember, consumables drive that traffic. And we have, by unlocking that price point -- and as we continue to unlock the price point, it's going to open up more opportunities for us to bring in really powerful value items. So pleased with customer traffic. In fact, I'll throw this in. Customer traffic was up 3.4% on the Family Dollar side. So we are seeing movement now with the customer base. \nJeffrey Davis: And as it relates to the investments that we're making, they're really twofold. So you have expense mix investments as well as CapEx. As we think about the expense investments, I think you're spot on with respect to the wage and store standard elements. There's a few elements that also transcend into our supply chain as we need to increase and improve the standards in our DCs. We're right on track with respect to how we thought they would play out over the course of this year and then as we think about going into next year. \n From a CapEx perspective, you kind of layer on top of that, then the work that we're going to be doing with our roto cart rollout and what we need to do with trailers and lift gates in the actual to other parts as well as what we're going to be doing from an IT perspective in adding additional capabilities with systems. \n As you think about what's the level of comp that we're going to need to deliver. There's going to be a number of factors that you have to take into account and quite honestly, we are working through that right now as we look out. One is going to be what's going to be rate of inflation as it relates to our cost in the marketplace, especially in labor, which is one of our more significant areas. \n The other piece, of course, is going to be in sales mix. The comp, you need a little higher level of comp when your sales mix is more weighted towards consumables versus discretionary. We believe, over time, we're going to see this mix balance out and then be not as significant a shift on a year-over-year basis, which you're seeing right now. Once again, that's over the long term. We had talked a little bit about this in the Investor Day, where we think that both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree will kind of average out over the period of time. So I'm not going to give you a comp number that we need to meet in order to leverage expenses at this point in time because there's a number of factors that we need to give a little more thought to and quite honestly, depending on what the economy does. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Wanted to just clarify and then ask the follow-up, all in one. The higher expenses this quarter, parsing it out between inflationary pressures being a little bit higher? Or are you spending more than planned or than you thought? And then bigger picture, the $10 in 2026, a long way to get there gives you flexibility. I don't think you've said it's ratable in any way. It may not be linear. What happened with expenses show that you're not afraid to spend back into the business. So curious where you're tracking. I'm sure you have your own plan and where '24, I know it's an early look, may land in terms of that run rate of expenses? \nJeffrey Davis: Great question. And I'm glad that I got this question finally. One of the things that if you take a look at this quarter and the pace that we're on, we are right on our outlook that we had anticipated with respect to the level of spend in the transformation. And we are actually leveraging against our original forecast, given this strong sales performance. This is also taking into account once again, unfortunately, this accrual adjustment that we just needed to make. \n So as we move forward, we continue to be disciplined in our spend. We look, as Rick has said, in some situations, an opportunity to pull forward a few items if we believe that we're going to be able to get the returns that much sooner. But the rate at which we are investing is according to our original outlook that we were we said at the beginning of this year. There are some modest inflationary components, as you can imagine, predominantly in utilities, and it is, as a result of the heat down that we're seeing on a national basis. The other area we're seeing a little more inflation would be in fuel, particularly in diesel fuel. And we've seen that here most recently and is reflected in -- both of these items are reflected in our guidance for the back half of this year. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. \nKelly Bania: I just wanted to go back to the shrink and mix and just be clear about the magnitude that is maybe coming in different or the same versus your expectations. And also how those 2 factors are planned for the second half. And also just related to the shrink, what kind of margin investment at all do you see necessary to combat the shrink headwind? And is that in your long-term plan? \nJeffrey Davis: Great. Thank you, Kelly. There's a few things here. As we think about shrink and mix, it has definitely advanced a little further than what we had anticipated in our guidance that we had given last quarter. Having said that, we believe that there are other more favorable items that are helping to offset against that. One, in our sales momentum; Two, we are seeing additional freight opportunity as it relates from an ocean perspective. But as it relates to shrink and mix, we had mentioned earlier that we had about $0.55 in total expected as an adjustment to our comp -- to our earnings, and that was going to be spread pretty evenly between shrink and mix. Of that $0.55, about $0.15 of that was actually incurred in the first quarter. So that remains -- that gives you a $0.40 for the back for Q2 through Q4. \n In Q2, against our original forecast, shrink and mix advanced another $0.08 on us. All of this is included in our forecast and as we're thinking about the back half, to the extent that there is any further acceleration, how we're thinking about offsetting that through other margin opportunities as we think about once again from additional freight favorability and/or other options that we have through the P&L. \nRichard Dreiling: So -- and I'd like to add 1 thing, if I can, Jeff. We are now taking a very defensive approach to shrink. And it's taken us a quarter, but we have several new shrink formats that we'll introduce in the back half of the year. And it goes everything from moving certain SKUs to behind the check stand. It has to do with some cases being locked up. And even to the point where we have some stores that can't keep a certain SKU on the shelf just discontinuing the item. So we have a lot of things in the works that's going to roll forward. You had a question about the mix. Is that correct? \nKelly Bania: And what's in the back half assumption? \nJeffrey Davis: She's asking specifically what's in the back half assumption, which I have not provided. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Okay. Fair enough. \nJeffrey Davis: So let me -- what I gave was a pretty widespread answer. If you think about the balance of the year, in Q3, what we've said and really in the back half of the year, Q3 sales mix and shrink continues to be a headwind for us. We've taken approximately 70% to 75% of our stores and inventories. So we'll be through the balance of most of those stores by the end of the third quarter. So sales mix and shrink continues to be a little bit of a headwind for us. \n Freight as far as diesel fuel continues to be a little bit of a headwind for us. And then once again, I said from utilities and this heat down back on this to be a little bit of a headwind for us. Offsetting that is going to be certain tailwinds. We've got sales momentum that we are projecting. We know that we believe that we have opportunities in additional freight from an ocean freight perspective. And also, we are starting to lap many of the SG&A investments that we started last year. As you go further into the back half of the year, we have less impact of sales mix and shrink because once again, we've taken all of our inventory. Fourth quarter is a much stronger quarter for us from a seasonal perspective, and it's focused on discretionary. \n And then the tailwinds in the back half or in the fourth quarter. Once again, we have the 53rd week, which we'll make an adjustment for continued sales momentum in our projection, ocean freight. And then once again, we can further along in lapping those SG&A investments that we started in the back half of last year. So as we progress through the quarters, the fourth quarter, we believe, will be one of our strongest quarters because we have less headwinds from shrink and mix, as well as the sales momentum and continued oceanic freight opportunity. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: My question is on Family Dollar. I was wondering if you could speak to the progress on rolling out the higher shelf freights across the chain? And then just one for Jeff. On that $0.07, which banner was that in? Or was that in the corporate line? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. In regards to the 78-inch profile, we hope to have that complete towards the end of the year. I would say we're probably maybe 40% or 50% done. While we're doing the Family Dollar side, we're also going to do the Dollar Tree side. So we're making progress on it. And the H2.5 remodels, all of those have the new shelf profile in. And by the way, the shelf profile raise allows us to add more cooler doors and refrigerated. \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. And on the journal liability claims, it was across both banners, and the best way to think about it was pretty evenly split. \nOperator: We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. \nRichard Dreiling: No, thank you all for your time and look forward to talking to you soon. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Dreiling",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. I'd like to welcome all of you that have joined our call this morning. I am sure that many of you had a chance to attend our investor conference in June. I hope the information we presented was valuable to you and that you left the event with a better understanding of the key growth strategies that we have in place to deliver $10 or more EPS by 2026.  \n I am confident that the team has identified the right levers to unlock the true value of our business. We are making good progress and continue to act with urgency to accelerate the pace of improvement in our merchandising, store operations, supply chain and IT infrastructure. Our renewed merchandising efforts represent a major opportunity to unlock value. We outlined our multi-price journey at Dollar Tree, detailed our real estate and merchandising initiatives at Family Dollar and reviewed our plans to improve store standards across the enterprise.  \n We have also launched efforts to drive sales productivity and increase operating efficiency like simplifying the truck unloading process and improving in-stock levels. You heard me say many times that retail is all about growing units, growing transactions and growing sales per square foot. When these retail fundamentals move in the right direction, everything else follows.  \n I am pleased to report that all 3 are heading in the right direction for us. For the past 2 quarters, both segments posted positive unit growth in consumables, while the market has been negative. Second quarter traffic was up over 3% at Family Dollar and nearly 10% at Dollar Tree. The fourth consecutive quarter of growth at Family Dollar and the second for Dollar Tree. And finally, sales per square foot is up 4% at Family Dollar and 6% at Dollar Tree.  \n When it comes to our momentum in these key retail fundamentals, our ongoing merchandising efforts and the investments in labor and stores are paying dividends and setting the stage for everything else to follow. \n Now let me review some of our second quarter highlights. A little later, Jeff will provide a more detailed review of our results and update you on our outlook for the balance of the year.  \n For the quarter, on a consolidated basis, we delivered an 8.2% increase in sales to $7.3 billion, with 6.9% enterprise comp growth and $287.8 million of operating income, which led to EPS of $0.91. In our Dollar Tree segment, our 7.8% comp was driven by 9.6% more traffic, with a modest offset from average ticket. Dollar Tree's momentum remained strong with this quarter's comp coming in on top of a 7.5% comp last year.  \n Meanwhile, the Family Dollar segment continues to make good progress in its operational turnaround. The second quarter comp of 5.8% was nicely balanced between 3.4% more traffic and 2.3% average ticket growth with the strong comp trends being supported by our improved price position and merchandising efforts. While the challenging macro environment continues to pressure our sales mix in both segments, I am pleased with the gains in traffic, new customers and market share.  \n Regarding the industry-wide shift in consumer purchasing behaviors to consumables, we believe this is reflective of the current macroeconomic environment and continuing rotation to a prepandemic balance after years of elevated spending across discretionary categories. We believe we are winning in consumables as more customers come to see Dollar Tree and Family Dollar as the compelling destinations for value.  \n At Dollar Tree, our multi-price strategy provides flexibility to respond to changing customer needs. At Family Dollar, our improved price image and wide range of merchandising initiatives are clearly resonating with consumers. In this environment, consumers from all income levels are increasingly seeking value.  \n We are well positioned to capture incremental share of wallet when higher income consumers respond to our strong price value proposition and when lower income customers concentrate their spending on needs-based consumables. This is particularly true across food and other consumables where value-oriented retailers are taking unit and dollar share. As a result, food categories are disproportionately driving sales momentum across the value retail landscape.  \n Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are no exception. Our food business is especially well positioned in the current environment, and we are seeing extremely high volume growth across our frozen and center store food categories. There is also growing evidence that consumers are seeking value through private brands, expanding and improving our private brand assortment will be a significant growth vehicle for us going forward.  \n To this end, the private brand expansion program at Family Dollar remains on track. This year, we launched over 125 private brand items, which we will further accelerate when our new family wellness and vitamin products hit store shelves in the fourth quarter. \n We are already seeing encouraging results across our private brands with second quarter penetration expanding by 55 basis points, units sold growing by 4% and private brand comps increasing over 15%. New customers are the lifeblood of retail and a critical part of driving traffic and market share.  \n In the past year, we have added nearly 5 million new customers across both segments with 2.6 million of these customers having a household income over $125,000. Importantly, our research tells us that a very high percentage of these new customers come back visiting an average of 5x in the year following their initial trip. In fact, we now rank in the top 10 retailers measured by annual new customer activations. These positive traffic and new customer trends are leading to strong market share gains.  \n For the second quarter in a row, both segments gained market share in consumables as our unit volume grew while the market's unit volume shrink. According to Nielsen data, our second quarter consumable unit volume growth outpaced the market by over 1,100 basis points at Dollar Tree and 530 basis points at Family Dollar, with both segments extending their margin of outperformance from last quarter.  \n Shifting from our recent sales performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on several key initiatives across our company. In merchandising, we have increased our Dollar Tree Plus target to 4,900 stores by year-end, up from 4,300 stores that we articulated in June. At the end of the second quarter, our Dollar Tree Plus assortment was available in over 3,600 locations and the $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated assortment was available in nearly 5,600 stores.  \n At Family Dollar, we are on track to complete planogram resets at all of our stores by November, and we are pleased with the sales lift from these resets so far. In real estate, we remain on pace to hit our target of 600 to 650 new store openings this year with roughly 2/3 of those coming in the back half of the year. We also continue to make progress with our emerging formats at Family Dollar.  \n We completed 271 H2.5 renovations bringing the total number of 2.5 locations to 830. We opened or converted 90 Family Dollar stores under our rural combo format. \n Overall, we are on track to complete at least 1,000 Family Dollar renovations by year-end. In supply chain, Mike Kindy and his team are investing in temperature control, across our distribution center network. Adding full temperature control to our DCs improves the work environment for our associates and drives improved operating performance. It also drives efficiency by reducing cross-stocking expenses and increasing flexibility to store the full range of OTC HBA products. We recently expanded temperature controls at 2 additional DCs, which brings us to 4 in total. By year-end, we expect to upgrade 8 additional DCs with the balance rolled out by the end of 2024.  \n While still in its early days, we continue to make good progress on our roto cart rollout. Beta testing on roto cart deliveries is currently underway, and we are on track for our D.C. and Matthews, North Carolina to be roto cart enabled by the end of this year.  \n Moving on to IT. We're also making good progress on needed upgrades to our infrastructure, particularly our new store and inventory management systems. Meanwhile, our new warehouse and transportation management systems are progressing through their development stages with rollouts anticipated to begin early next year.  \n With the continued focus on our people, we saw double-digit improvements during the second quarter in employee turnover and store vacancy levels across both segments as the investments we are making in store level wages, benefits and elevated standards begin to yield clear intangible results. As I mentioned at our investor conference, we had a significant number of stores that don't open on time or close early due to staffing shortages.  \n I'm happy to report that we saw a measurable improvement in this area during the second quarter at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. If we eliminated all 8 openings and early closings, it could add 1.5 points to our overall comp. In summary, when it comes to the factors that we can control, we continue to execute at a high level. As our recent sales performance shows, consumers are clearly responding to our merchandising initiatives.  \n At the same time, Mike Creedon and his team are acting with urgency to upgrade our store conditions and improve operational consistency across our store fleet. We are making the investments we need to make to accelerate our top line performance, generate greater operating efficiencies and improve profitability. We've built a strong cultural foundation as an organization, and we are focused on delivering better results for all our key constituents including our more than 200,000 associates.  \n And speaking of our associates, we've just spent the last 2 weeks meeting with our field leadership at our headquarters here in Virginia. A team of more than 1,300 leaders who represent more than 200,000 associates and the energy coming out of those sessions was amazing. Our people are the key to a great customer experience, and I am so grateful for the progress we've made in our turnaround efforts over such a short period of time.  \n I will now turn the call over to Jeff to review our financial results and outlook for the balance of the year. Thank you, Jeff. We remain very pleased with the progress of our transformation in these early stages and remain confident in the 3-year road map outlined in June. For those of you familiar with my operating philosophy, the immediate focus of any retail turnaround is growing sales. From that perspective, we are succeeding. \n We are providing a new experience to the next generation of customers across both our segments and seeing strong repeat purchase activity from these new shoppers. Our goal is to provide the consumer with convenience, value, variety and a great shopping experience. Our stores are already conveniently located. 87% of the population of the Continental United States lives within a 5-mile radius of one of our stores. \n As we grow our footprint, we will be closer and more convenient to an even greater number of customers. I remain confident that our long-term earnings potential can be realized within the time frame we have communicated. Our improving top line performance places us in a position of strength and the combined impact of our merchandising, real estate, supply chain, IT and people initiatives should put us in an even stronger position relative to the competition. Operator, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions. Yes, Mike, 3 really good questions. First off, is the lift heavier than we thought it was going to be. I would say no. When we all got in on this, we knew what we were facing. I do think what we're trying to do, because of what has to be done, we are moving much faster than I thought we would. And when you move fast, it takes a little more expense, it takes a little more effort, it takes a little more push. And so is the lift heavier? No, it's the same. But what we're trying to do is move as fast as we possibly can. \n In regards to the drop-through, I think we are learning to do a lot of things, flexing a lot of muscles that we have not used in the past. The Family Dollar side is all about the commitment you make to the vendor community. And Jeff called out the potential for increased rebates and allowances that's all driven by retail execution. And the Family Dollar people are doing a really terrific job on that. What has happened on the Dollar Tree side, the Dollar Tree people have responded to the change in patterns that the consumer is exhibiting in our store, buying more consumables. \n So I think and I always have subscribed to the fact that when top line starts moving, everything else catches up. I remain incredibly bullish on our margin targets and where we're going. And I do not see any trouble to getting to more realistic margin levels. In regards to the improvements in the supply chain, that will be a combination of both. As you know, we've got massive changes taking place on the supply chain side. Some of that will make it to the bottom line and some of it will invest. And Jeff, I don't know if you have anything you want to add? Yes. Great question again. What's happening in Dollar Tree as we were responding to the needs of the consumer. You go back a year ago, we did not have nearly the number of consumable SKUs that we now have in the store. Saying all that, our discretionary business on the Dollar Tree side was slightly up. But what -- when I think about quarter 3, particularly or quarter 4, we're going to be in a much stronger position on the margin due because of the change in the mix, we think is going to happen. And that's because quarter 4 is a very seasonal quarter for us with Christmas and Halloween and all of that. So I remain bullish on it. I do believe, Ed, that we are responding to the customer and sales takes care of everything eventually, and the 2-year stack in Dollar Tree is just outstanding. So I remain very, very bullish on where we're going with the margin. Yes. Another effort that we're working really, really hard on. In regards to the number of cooler doors, we're going to go from 3, I believe, 10 or 12 is the plan. We'll have a door that is a $1.25, couple of doors will be $3, $4, $5, and we're actually looking as we look at the multi-price point to expand that even more. The interesting thing is when a frozen food item goes into the basket, the basket actually gets larger. So your point about driving traffic, driving transactions is spot on. The other interesting thing, when we went to $3, $4 and $5, that allowed us to offer a family serving versus at $1.25, where it's just a single serve. So again, much more appealing to the actual -- to the consumer. \n The other thing, John, the fact that we went to multiple price points allowed us to put ice back in the stores. And ice is always a big seller. When we were locked in on the dollar, we had to take it out and we went to a larger bag, 7 pounds, took it to $2. And again, we're back in the ice business. I also agree that what will happen is we will keep growing sales and allow us to leverage our SG&A down in the stores. \n And then I also want you to think about the fact as we roll roto carts out, that we'll be delivering to the Dollar Tree stores and those also. So all of that time that it takes to unload a truck will be invested in putting more multi-price point items out on the shelves. Yes. Great question. As I look at the flow across both banners through the quarter, it was pretty consistent all the way through. We started off strong, and it remained strong through the balance of the quarter. \n There -- in terms of performance, I think it's pretty even, but I will make this observation. It appears that the trade down from a higher income customer it's coming more in the urban environment than in the rural environment. So that's -- it's an interesting spin, but it's pretty even all the way across. In regards to the competitive environment out there in regards to pricing, the way I see it, it's very rational right now. Nothing significant is going on. I would say the ad collateral is basically the same it's always been. Everybody's kind of -- I think everybody is on the same playing field right now. I'll take the first part, Jeff. Matt, the traffic is steadily increasing in Dollar Tree. Our traffic was up 9% in quarter 2. Really, really pleased with that. Your other question is discretionary was still up in Dollar Tree. It was up 3.9%. The consumables though, were up over 11%, which is our way -- and remember, consumables drive that traffic. And we have, by unlocking that price point -- and as we continue to unlock the price point, it's going to open up more opportunities for us to bring in really powerful value items. So pleased with customer traffic. In fact, I'll throw this in. Customer traffic was up 3.4% on the Family Dollar side. So we are seeing movement now with the customer base. So -- and I'd like to add 1 thing, if I can, Jeff. We are now taking a very defensive approach to shrink. And it's taken us a quarter, but we have several new shrink formats that we'll introduce in the back half of the year. And it goes everything from moving certain SKUs to behind the check stand. It has to do with some cases being locked up. And even to the point where we have some stores that can't keep a certain SKU on the shelf just discontinuing the item. So we have a lot of things in the works that's going to roll forward. You had a question about the mix. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. Fair enough. Yes. In regards to the 78-inch profile, we hope to have that complete towards the end of the year. I would say we're probably maybe 40% or 50% done. While we're doing the Family Dollar side, we're also going to do the Dollar Tree side. So we're making progress on it. And the H2.5 remodels, all of those have the new shelf profile in. And by the way, the shelf profile raise allows us to add more cooler doors and refrigerated. No, thank you all for your time and look forward to talking to you soon."

            "name": "Jeffrey Davis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we continued to generate strong top line results across both segments, driven by growth in customer traffic, unit volume and an accelerating market share. We continue to have a favorable view of the current operating environment. Our top line performance was not driven by any material increase in promotional intensity.  \n While our sales mix continues to shift towards consumables, we generated more gross profit dollars in the second quarter than we did last year. We also remain resolute in our strategy to make the necessary investments in stores, IT, supply chain and our people.  \n On a consolidated level, operating income declined 43.1% to $287.8 million and operating margin compressed by 360 basis points. This was driven by a 220 basis point decrease in gross margin and a 130 basis point increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin contracted primarily from lower merchandise margin as we lap the margin benefit from last year's $1.25 rollout and from unfavorable sales mix, product cost inflation and elevated shrink.  \n SG&A expenses expanded primarily from wage investments, incentive compensation, general liability claims, and repairs and maintenance costs from improving store conditions. These were partially offset by leverage from increased comp sales and lower stock compensation expense.  \n Notably, the impact of general liability claims was $0.07 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 24% versus 24.2% last year as higher work opportunity tax credits were partially offset by higher nondeductible expenses. Net income was $200.4 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.91 versus $1.60 a year ago.  \n At a business segment level, Dollar Tree's operating income declined 27.8% to $397.8 million and operating margin compressed 510 basis points. This was driven by a 400 basis point decline in gross margin and a 110 basis point increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin contracted primarily from lower merchandise margin as we lapped the margin benefit from last year's $1.25 rollout and from unfavorable sales mix, product cost inflation and elevated shrink.  \n These were partially offset by comp sales leverage against occupancy costs. SG&A expenses expanded principally from wage investments, minimum wage increases, general liability claims, utility costs and repair and maintenance costs for improving store conditions. These were partially offset by sales comp leverage.  \n Family Dollar's operating income declined 78.5% to $11.8 million and operating margin compressed 140 basis points. This was led by a 30 basis point decrease in gross margin and 110 basis point increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin contracted primarily from elevated shrink with a partial offset from leveraging occupancy costs.  \n SG&A expenses also increased principally from wage investments, minimum wage increases, utility costs and repairs and maintenance costs from improving store conditions. These were partially offset by sales comp leverage.  \n Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. As a reminder, my comments reflect balance sheet comparisons between Q2 2023 and Q2 2022. Inventory decreased by 1.7%. While inventory was below last year's level, it was elevated due to early receipts of imports. With the rapid recovery across our supply chain, seasonal imports from Asia arrived well ahead of our scheduled third quarter receipts.  \n Moving forward, we will continue to manage our inventory and related trade accounts payable to improve free cash flow generation. Capital expenditures were $425.4 million in the second quarter versus $276.2 million last year. reflecting elevated investment levels in new store openings and renovations, supply chain and information systems.  \n For fiscal 2023, we expect capital expenditures will total approximately $2 billion, with approximately 40% allocated to maintenance CapEx and the balance towards growth initiatives. Free cash flow improved $40.5 million versus the second quarter of last year. This represents the third consecutive quarterly improvement in free cash flow generation, even as we make significant investments to support the long-term growth of the business.  \n For the first 6 months of 2023, free cash flow improved $157 million versus the same period last year, led largely by lower merchandise inventories with a partial offset from lower net income adjusted for noncash items, increased CapEx and the timing of accounts payable. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares for $99.9 million, including applicable excise tax. At quarter end, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.  \n Cash and cash equivalents totaled $512.7 million compared to $688.9 million a year ago. In July, we established a new commercial paper program to issue unsecured notes with maturities up to 397 days with an aggregate face amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion. We expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The notes will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Our revolving credit facility will serve as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of outstanding notes under this program.  \n This new program provides additional flexibility to manage our working capital needs and at current rates, it provides short-term borrowing at lower rates than our credit facility. There are no notes issued and outstanding as of the end of the quarter. Now let me provide some additional visibility into our sales and EPS expectations for the third quarter and the balance of 2023.  \n At a high level, we are reiterating the center point of the full year outlook we gave last quarter and bringing in the high and low end to better reflect the balance of opportunities and risks we see in the current operating environment. Our outlook takes into consideration the following factors: continued shift in sales mix and unfavorable shrink trends over the balance of the year, our utility and repairs and maintenance costs related to the national heat down, higher diesel fuel prices.  \n On the Plus side, we expect improved sales performance and incremental ocean freight savings. That all said, we see nothing systemic or structural in the current environment that would have a lasting negative implications for the multiyear outlook that we shared in June.  \n So against that backdrop, we expect consolidated net sales for the third quarter will be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion. Based on a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales for the enterprise in each of the segments. We estimate third quarter diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $0.94 to $1.04.  \n For the full fiscal year, which includes a 53rd week this year, we are raising our 2023 sales expectations to a range of $30.6 billion to $30.9 billion, driven by a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales across both segments and the full enterprise. Based on better visibility into the margin headwinds I just detailed, we are narrowing our full year diluted GAAP earnings per share outlook to a range of $5.78 to $6.08, including the $0.12 legal reserve we talked in the first quarter.  \n We still expect selling square footage to grow between 3% and 3.5% for the year and new store growth to be back-end weighted. Other considerations in our 2023 outlook include the following: We have not included any assumptions for incremental share repurchases; depreciation and amortization should be in the range of $845 million to $850 million; net interest expense should be approximately $25 million for the third quarter and approximately $110 million for the full year.\n We are assuming an effective tax rate of approximately 23% and for the third quarter and approximately 24% for the full year. We expect 220.6 million diluted shares for the third quarter and 221 million diluted shares for the full year. Our outlook reflects continued margin pressures that we expect to persist through the back half of the year. Based on our continued market share gains at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we are in a good position to generate higher levels of rebates and promotional allowances.  \n We also continue to be disciplined in managing our cost structure, even as we make investments necessary to meet our stated long-term growth objective of $10 or more of EPS by 2026. Now I'll turn the call back over to Rick for closing remarks. Yes. There's a couple of additional items, Michael. We -- as it relates to the flow-through, and we tried to call us out -- it's really a situation where our sales mix is an area that, as you see across the retail landscape, people are moving more into consumables, and that we're not immune to that. The other area that we talked about was shrink and the ongoing progression there. Those are the 2 more significant items from a gross margin basis that are really impacting us and addressing the flow-through or restricting the flow through. \n The other thing that it's kind of muted in our comments, but this past quarter, we had about $0.07 related to an accrual adjustment that we needed to make for the progression of certain general liability claims that really dated back to 2019 and 2020 during the pandemic period. Once again, something that we needed to take care of, but it also restricted the flow through and the tremendous sales that we were driving over the course of the year. So I think that we're seeing right now, we've called out in the past and reason for our adjustment in the overall guidance that we gave last quarter, which was around sales and shrink. And then it was just further exacerbated, unfortunately, with this accrual adjustment we need to make. And Ed, the other thing I would add to that, hopefully, I hope don't sound like a broken record here, but -- unfortunately, the headwinds we're having in shrink are muting our margins right now. When you get a chance, you have an opportunity to take a look at the supplemental presentation that we have, you'll see that shrink is continuing to be -- restrict our margins by about 75 to 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We are taking the appropriate actions, we believe in the organization to start to address that. As you know, shrink is a sort of a trailing indication because stores are shrinking over the course of the year. And as you're adding new actions to reduce it, it takes time for those things to actually take hold. But between the sales mix and the shrink once again, this is one of the things that have been muting the margin. \n The other thing that while we are seeing less frequency of product cost increases and maybe the magnitude of those are not as significant. They are still in the marketplace. And Rick McNeely and his team are freeing our ways to work through those through a number of different merchandising actions. So we still have a little bit of headwind there on product cost pressures, which as we move forward, depending on consumer demands, we believe that those will start to -- should start to abate over time. And as it relates to the investments that we're making, they're really twofold. So you have expense mix investments as well as CapEx. As we think about the expense investments, I think you're spot on with respect to the wage and store standard elements. There's a few elements that also transcend into our supply chain as we need to increase and improve the standards in our DCs. We're right on track with respect to how we thought they would play out over the course of this year and then as we think about going into next year. \n From a CapEx perspective, you kind of layer on top of that, then the work that we're going to be doing with our roto cart rollout and what we need to do with trailers and lift gates in the actual to other parts as well as what we're going to be doing from an IT perspective in adding additional capabilities with systems. \n As you think about what's the level of comp that we're going to need to deliver. There's going to be a number of factors that you have to take into account and quite honestly, we are working through that right now as we look out. One is going to be what's going to be rate of inflation as it relates to our cost in the marketplace, especially in labor, which is one of our more significant areas. \n The other piece, of course, is going to be in sales mix. The comp, you need a little higher level of comp when your sales mix is more weighted towards consumables versus discretionary. We believe, over time, we're going to see this mix balance out and then be not as significant a shift on a year-over-year basis, which you're seeing right now. Once again, that's over the long term. We had talked a little bit about this in the Investor Day, where we think that both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree will kind of average out over the period of time. So I'm not going to give you a comp number that we need to meet in order to leverage expenses at this point in time because there's a number of factors that we need to give a little more thought to and quite honestly, depending on what the economy does. Great question. And I'm glad that I got this question finally. One of the things that if you take a look at this quarter and the pace that we're on, we are right on our outlook that we had anticipated with respect to the level of spend in the transformation. And we are actually leveraging against our original forecast, given this strong sales performance. This is also taking into account once again, unfortunately, this accrual adjustment that we just needed to make. \n So as we move forward, we continue to be disciplined in our spend. We look, as Rick has said, in some situations, an opportunity to pull forward a few items if we believe that we're going to be able to get the returns that much sooner. But the rate at which we are investing is according to our original outlook that we were we said at the beginning of this year. There are some modest inflationary components, as you can imagine, predominantly in utilities, and it is, as a result of the heat down that we're seeing on a national basis. The other area we're seeing a little more inflation would be in fuel, particularly in diesel fuel. And we've seen that here most recently and is reflected in -- both of these items are reflected in our guidance for the back half of this year. Great. Thank you, Kelly. There's a few things here. As we think about shrink and mix, it has definitely advanced a little further than what we had anticipated in our guidance that we had given last quarter. Having said that, we believe that there are other more favorable items that are helping to offset against that. One, in our sales momentum; Two, we are seeing additional freight opportunity as it relates from an ocean perspective. But as it relates to shrink and mix, we had mentioned earlier that we had about $0.55 in total expected as an adjustment to our comp -- to our earnings, and that was going to be spread pretty evenly between shrink and mix. Of that $0.55, about $0.15 of that was actually incurred in the first quarter. So that remains -- that gives you a $0.40 for the back for Q2 through Q4. \n In Q2, against our original forecast, shrink and mix advanced another $0.08 on us. All of this is included in our forecast and as we're thinking about the back half, to the extent that there is any further acceleration, how we're thinking about offsetting that through other margin opportunities as we think about once again from additional freight favorability and/or other options that we have through the P&L. She's asking specifically what's in the back half assumption, which I have not provided. So let me -- what I gave was a pretty widespread answer. If you think about the balance of the year, in Q3, what we've said and really in the back half of the year, Q3 sales mix and shrink continues to be a headwind for us. We've taken approximately 70% to 75% of our stores and inventories. So we'll be through the balance of most of those stores by the end of the third quarter. So sales mix and shrink continues to be a little bit of a headwind for us. \n Freight as far as diesel fuel continues to be a little bit of a headwind for us. And then once again, I said from utilities and this heat down back on this to be a little bit of a headwind for us. Offsetting that is going to be certain tailwinds. We've got sales momentum that we are projecting. We know that we believe that we have opportunities in additional freight from an ocean freight perspective. And also, we are starting to lap many of the SG&A investments that we started last year. As you go further into the back half of the year, we have less impact of sales mix and shrink because once again, we've taken all of our inventory. Fourth quarter is a much stronger quarter for us from a seasonal perspective, and it's focused on discretionary. \n And then the tailwinds in the back half or in the fourth quarter. Once again, we have the 53rd week, which we'll make an adjustment for continued sales momentum in our projection, ocean freight. And then once again, we can further along in lapping those SG&A investments that we started in the back half of last year. So as we progress through the quarters, the fourth quarter, we believe, will be one of our strongest quarters because we have less headwinds from shrink and mix, as well as the sales momentum and continued oceanic freight opportunity. Yes. And on the journal liability claims, it was across both banners, and the best way to think about it was pretty evenly split."

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. As many of you are aware, Dollar Tree will be hosting its investor conference in 4 weeks on June 21 in Norfolk, Virginia, near our corporate headquarters. The conference will be webcast, and I hope to see many of you at this important event. Our investor conference has been overdue, and we understand the level of anticipation for many investors. I hope next month's gathering will provide each of you a better understanding of the transformation taking shape and the speed with which we are making these changes to increase both our productivity and profitability at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.\n We have been hard at work building the team we need to drive the transformation of this business. The more we dig in, the more historically clear the opportunity becomes, and we are on our way to most fully realize upon it. Our stores are of comparable size to those of our closest peers, but they generate far less revenue per store. We understand why, and we know how to close the gap. There are no structural impediments to our progressing towards this goal. As we do, we will drive growth and gain market share. With the operating leverage embedded in the retail model, accelerating growth in revenue per store will translate into higher margins, and higher margins will increase our return on capital and fueling accelerated store growth. We've gone down this road before, and we know the way. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve both of our segments, and we are pursuing that with vigor.\n While our enterprise-wide transformation is still in the early stages, we are already seeing results. Our early initiatives have begun to deliver growth and market share gains. We are driving this transformation in the most dynamic retail environment I have seen in my career. While this volatility is real and will generate bumps along the way, it will not affect where this great adventure ends.\n In addition to the historic levels of inflation and labor market challenges, retailers have seen in just the past quarter, elevated levels of shrink and even further pressure on the consumers' willingness to spend on discretionary goods, shrink and the mix shift from discretionary goods have pressured margins throughout retail. We are no exception. Ultimately, shrink will either be resolved through defensive merchandising, store closures and/or through government action at the local level. Regarding the near-term unfavorable impact of consumables mix, we believe consumer shopping behavior will normalize over time and the margin profile will rebound.\n We are acutely attuned to each of these bumps. In the end, none will materially affect our delivering on the promise of this transformation unless we allow them to distract us from what we know we have to do, and we will not allow that to happen.\n We bench our top line sales performance primarily on 3 specific metrics. Sales per square foot growth, growth in transaction count and unit sales or volume growth. Based on these 3 metrics, I am pleased with our quarter 1 performance and the direction we are headed. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong. Most significantly, we continue to gain market share, and our traffic and unit volume growth are driving strong top line momentum. The market share gains are a clear validation of the actions that we have taken on pricing and wages and the ongoing improvements we have made in our merchandise assortment, service level and store standards.\n Now, despite our commercial success and building momentum, we are experiencing near-term margin pressures from the macro factors impacting sales mix and elevated shrink. But the most important message that I want to convey today is that we remain completely focused on delivering on our full potential and are executing on our transformation investments at full speed.\n I will now review the highlights for quarter 1. Following my remarks, Jeff will provide a detailed overview of our financial performance and our updated 2023 outlook. For the quarter, we delivered $7.32 billion in sales, an increase of 6.1%, with enterprise comp growth of 4.8% and operating income of $419.7 million, leading to EPS of $1.35 and adjusted EPS of $1.47, when adjusting for a $30 million accrual related to pending legal matters regarding our West Memphis distribution center. Our merchandising and execution remain strong, with comp increases of 3.4% at Dollar Tree and 6.6% at Family Dollar. The underlying sales strength was concentrated in consumables and driven by meaningful transaction growth across both segments.  \n Results were even more impressive in the context of Dollar Tree's 11.2% comp increase from a year ago. After fully cycling the $1.25 price point in February, customer traffic remained very favorable at Dollar Tree as comparable traffic count increased by 5.5%. Notably, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in comps at Family Dollar, with comp traffic up 4.3%.\n For nearly all of 2022 comp traffic counts trends in both segments were negative, so quarter 1 was an important inflection point for the company, with traffic increasing both sequentially and year-over-year.\n The turnaround at Family Dollar is gaining meaningful traction. In addition to the improving traffic, Family Dollar's comp was driven by a 2.2% increase in average ticket. At Family Dollar, we increased our private brand penetration by approximately 80 basis points. Moving forward, we expect to continue growing private brands penetration as we further improve merchandise, presentation, packaging and quality control standards. For example, we recently opened a new test kitchen here in Chesapeake and are excited about our growing pipeline of private brand products across consumables, health and beauty and other high-growth categories. We are also encouraged by the margin opportunities associated with expanding our private brands business.\n Last year, we took pricing actions at Family Dollar to bring us more in line with our most direct competition. These price investments strengthen our value offering at Family Dollar and followed our transition to the $1.25 price point at Dollar Tree, along with investments in wages and store standards, the steps we have taken on pricing across both segments are critical to improving our long-term financial and operating performance. As I mentioned earlier, the consumer continues to be under pressure. There are simply fewer dollars available to them, and those dollars are not going as far as they did a year or 2 ago. We are past the multiple rounds of government stimulus. SNAP dollars have been reduced and tax refunds are running lower. These impacts, combined with persistent inflation, have more families prioritizing needs over wants.\n Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are part of the solution for shoppers buying for need and close to need as they look to stretch their paychecks. Our stores are nearby, easy to shop, and provide tremendous value. While these factors are contributing to the mix shift and pressuring our gross margins, they are also driving more shoppers into our stores with increased frequency. We will continue to respond to the needs of the consumer across both consumables and discretionary categories by offering tremendous value and a great selection. While this mix shift towards consumables is clearly a margin headwind, it is worth noting that the promotional environment remains rational and is not driving any additional margin pressure.\n At Dollar Tree, we made great strides with our multi-price strategy, and we remain on track to add $3 and $5-plus items to another 1,800 stores this year. In quarter 1, we added Dollar Tree Plus assortments to more than 400 stores and anticipate accelerating the pace of this rollout over the balance of the year. Additionally, we have aggressively expanded our product assortment at Dollar Tree stores with $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated products, adding 3,500 stores last year alone on this initiative.\n During the first quarter, we added multi-price frozen and refrigerated doors and more than 400 Dollar Tree stores. Both our Dollar Trees Plus and our multi-price frozen assortments drive incremental sales, with average ticket more than doubling its stores that we have added this expanded offering. Consumers are clearly responding, and the sales driving initiatives are already having a measurable impact on our results.\n Family Dollar, we are on track to add 16,000 new cooler doors in 2023. This is helping drive Family Dollar to its highest market share in close to 4 years as measured by quarter 1 dollar volume. On a unit volume basis, Family Dollar's quarter 1 share of industry growth was the highest in more than 3 years. We continue to improve the in-store experience at Family Dollar and completed more than 250 store renovations in the quarter.\n On last quarter's call, I shared the strategic rationale for our increased SG&A spending in 2023. These investments should be pursued as rapidly as our management bandwidth will allow. The sooner each is implemented, the sooner we will enjoy the benefits and the greater impact of our other investments. All of this is ultimately connected and interdependent. Many of our investments will be ongoing, including those on our associates and store conditions, and again, the results are starting to come in. We have already seen meaningful improvements in sales momentum and reduced associate turnover.\n In closing, we have a plan. I'm confident this plan will drive meaningful top line growth, increase productivity and improve profitability. We are vigorously executing on it. We will not allow bumps in the road to distract us or slow us down, and it's clear it's starting to work. Our investments in price, our stores, our merchandise and our associates have already begun delivering results.\n We will get to where we're going, but how we get there matters as well. I firmly believe that investments in our people and the communities we serve are the cornerstones of a successful retailer. We have taken a comprehensive approach to improve wages and benefits for our people and to increase associate engagement to make Dollar Tree and Family Dollar great places to work and grow. It is vital for the continued success of our organization to have a strong culture. While there is work to be done, we are pleased that our culture efforts are taking root and building the foundation for a thriving future.\n Finally, I am so very proud of the tremendous efforts of our 200,000-plus associates, each of whom has contributed to the great progress we are making and each of whom deserves our collective thanks.\n While Jeff will cover our outlook in more detail, I want to emphasize that we remain confident in the outlook for our business and our continued sales momentum. Our go-to-market strategies at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are working and clearly resonating with consumers. I look forward to sharing more detail on our long-term vision and our multiyear outlook next month at our investor conference.\n I will now turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffrey Davis: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, our top line performance was strong in both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. It was driven by meaningful growth in customer traffic, continued market share gains and an increase in underlying unit growth. Total sales increased 6.1% to $7.3 billion based on comp store sales growth of 4.8%. Traffic increased 5% on a consolidated basis, and average ticket was down slightly. Across the enterprise, our sales mix of consumables increased approximately 200 basis points as customer purchase behavior responded to deteriorating macro conditions.\n Our service levels were particularly strong in Q1. In-stock positions improved by 400 basis points in the Dollar Tree segment and by 200 basis points at Family Dollar. Our DC service levels also improved for both segments by nearly 1,600 basis points at Dollar Tree and approximately 500 basis points at Family Dollar.\n Operating income decreased by 43% to $419.1 million. Adjusted operating income decreased by 39% to $449.7 million. Recall that in Q1, we cycled the first full quarter of the $1.25 price point transition at Dollar Tree, which resulted in unfavorable margin comparisons given the outsized benefit we saw in Q1 last year. The variance between operating income and adjusted operating income came from a $30 million accrual related to previously disclosed legal proceedings associated with our Family Dollar distribution center in West Memphis, Arkansas.\n Gross profit decreased by 4.7% to $2.23 billion as gross margin contracted by 340 basis points. The biggest driver of the gross margin decline was merchandise cost. In Q1 last year, we benefited from the rollout of the $1.25 price point at Dollar Tree. In the current period, our sales mix shifted approximately 200 basis points towards lower-margin consumable merchandise. The impact of higher cost of goods and unfavorable sales mix were partially offset by lower freight costs and markdowns as we cycled the impact of our West Memphis DC closure last year.\n As Rick noted, elevated levels of shrink represent a persistent challenge. In Q1, shrink negatively impacted gross margin by 60 basis points and EPS by an incremental $0.14 per share compared to last year. On a business segment basis, Dollar Tree gross margin declined by approximately 530 basis points, primarily from lower merchandise margin based on the higher consumable mix and cycling the initial transition to the $1.25 price point, elevated shrink expense and increased distribution costs.\n We benefited modestly from lower spot rates for ocean freight relative to last year. But to date, this is only impacting a small portion of our shipments with a larger impact of savings from freight rate declines to come in the second half and into the years ahead.\n Family Dollar's gross margin decreased by approximately 100 basis points, with largely the same factors contributing to the decline as Dollar Tree. Specifically, gross margin was negatively impacted by mix, product cost increases, higher shrink and higher distribution costs, partially offset by lower markdowns and lower freight expenses.\n SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased 150 basis points to 24.8%. The biggest driver was wage investments for store and distribution center associates. We also experienced higher store facility costs as we continue to focus on improving store conditions as well as higher professional and marketing expenses.\n Corporate, support and other expenses were 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 10 basis points from last year. Net income was $299 million, and EPS was $1.35 in comparison to $2.37 a year ago. Adjusted net income was $325.1 million and adjusted EPS was $1.47. The $0.12 adjustment was related to the West Memphis legal accrual. Our effective tax rate was 24.1% versus 23.1% last year, reflecting lower stock-based compensation deductions and higher nondeductible expenses, partially offset by higher work opportunity tax credits. Adjusted for the impact of the West Memphis accrual, the Q1 implied tax rate for this year was 23.3% or 20 basis points higher than Q1 last year.\n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, my comments will reflect balance sheet comparisons at the end of Q1 2023 versus Q1 2022. Inventory increased 6.5% primarily from an increase in merchandise costs, DC unit volume growth, the continued rollout of our Dollar Tree multi-price inventory and new store growth. The quality of our inventory remains high and manageable. Q1 capital expenditures were $350.4 million versus $253.4 million. For fiscal 2023, we continue to expect capital expenditures to total approximately $2 billion, with approximately 40% dedicated to business continuity and the balance directed towards growth, optimization and productivity improvement.\n In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $151.1 million, of which $7.7 million did not settle until after quarter end. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $872.8 million compared to $1.2 billion. Our cash position increased $230 million in Q1 from the end of fiscal 2022 led by working capital improvements, partially offset by capital expenditures and share repurchases. Free cash flow improved to $402 million from $285 million last year.\n Moving to our sales and EPS outlook. The company expects consolidated net sales for the second quarter will range from $7 billion to $7.2 billion, based on a mid-single digit increase in comp store sales for the enterprise and for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Diluted EPS for the second quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.89. As a reminder, the bulk of our ocean freight savings for the year will fall in the second half, as previously mentioned.\n With respect to full year fiscal 2023 guidance, recall that fiscal 2023 has a 53rd week. Consolidated sales for the full fiscal year are now expected to range from $30 billion to $30.5 billion. The company expects to deliver a low to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase for the year, comprised of a low to mid-single digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a mid-single digit increase in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow by 3% to 3.5% for the year, with new store growth back-end weighted.\n While we modestly raised the midpoint of our top line guidance, we are incrementally more cautious on our margin outlook, given the growing industry-wide challenges of accelerating shrink, the unfavorable shift in sales mix and their impact on our near-term profitability. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, the impact of these 2 factors on our financial results has intensified.\n We expect that over time, our mix of discretionary will normalize and that we will also improve our performance on shrink through defensive merchandising efforts, real estate optimization and perhaps higher prices to compensate for areas of systematically higher shrink. We expect the combined and continuing full year earnings impact of unfavorable consumables mix and higher shrink is expected to be approximately $0.55 per share in 2023.\n Our modeling considerations for 2023 outlook include the following. We expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $845 million to $850 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million in Q2 and $110 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.1% to 24.3% for the second quarter and 23.9% to 24.1% for fiscal 2023. While our share repurchases are not included in our outlook, we had $1.7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of April 29. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 221.4 million shares for Q2 and 221.6 million shares for the full year.\n For the balance of 2023, we  will work diligently to offset potential margin pressures that could come from elevated levels of discretionary inventory. We are taking actions to mitigate the potential impact of these cost pressures such as further optimizing our promotional spending and vendor allowances, identifying opportunities to further reduce inbound freight costs and managing repairs and maintenance costs. We continue to see full year earnings benefit of $1 per share from lower ocean freight costs this year, which could be significantly weighted towards the back half of the year, and an additional $1 per share benefit in 2024 and beyond.\n As a result of the factors I just outlined, we are revising our diluted GAAP EPS outlook for fiscal 2023 to a range of $5.73 to $6.13, which includes the expected contribution from the 53rd week and the $0.12 legal reserve taken in Q1.\n I will now turn the call back over to Rick for closing remarks. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, Jeff. We are continuing to execute at a high level and acting with urgency around our business transformation, and I am pleased with our solid start to 2023. We are looking forward to our investor conference next month, where we expect to provide our investors and analysts with a multiyear outlook for the business, including a substantive and comprehensive overview of the key elements of our business. Our team has identified multiple levers to unlock value, and we have strong underlying business momentum that positions us favorably in the current retail and economic environment. We see a path to greater earnings power over the next 3 years and look forward to sharing our plans in more detail next month.\n I also want to take this opportunity to welcome our new Supply Chain Officer, Mike Kindy. I have worked with Mike in previous organizations, and he is a proven subject matter expert and thought leader in supply chain and logistics. I am very confident that Mike will demonstrate continued success at Dollar Tree based on his past record. I also want to thank John Flanagan for his contributions, which helped us get to where we are today. While John communicated to us at the outset is desired to serve only for a short period, over the past year, john has led our supply chain strategy and has overseen the early stages of the process to optimize our distribution network and he's had a tremendous impact.\n We are moving at a fast pace in our journey to fundamentally reposition our combined retailing operations for sustainable long-term growth. Our efforts are already paying off in the form of significant market share gains at both segments. Both formats have a clear runway for accelerated growth in productivity and profitability. Our leaders have complete ownership over the factors that will shape our outlook for the next 3 to 5 years. We have a winning team of more than 200,000 associates who are highly motivated and eager to succeed. I look forward to sharing more next month at our conference.\n And one last note. Before we go to Q&A, I want to share some IR news with you. Several months ago, Randy Guiler communicated with us his retirement plans. This advanced notification provided us with ample opportunity to seek Randy's replacement. I want to thank Randy for his 9 years of dedicated service leading the IR function at Dollar Tree. I am pleased to share that [ Bob LaFleur ] joined Dollar Tree on Monday of this week as our new SVP of Investor Relations. Randy will be with us at our upcoming investor conference and is continuing in his current role with the company through the month of June to help facilitate a smooth transition. Please join me in congratulating Randy on his impending retirement, and Bob on his new role at Dollar Tree.\n Operator, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. \nJohn Heinbockel: So Rick, it's more of a strategic question, right? If I think about your initiatives and then the consumer, do you think that consumable penetration, right, that mix not only will remain elevated, maybe the consumables mix goes higher over time. What's your thought on that? And then mitigating the impact of mix on margin. Private label will help, but maybe talk about where do you think that goes and the opportunity to do sort of ultimately a DG Fresh like distribution initiative, right, to bring down COGS in that area. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you, John. Great question. There's a lot of meat answering that question. The first thing I'd like to say is the strength that we are experiencing consumables has nothing to do with weakness in our discretionary. The fact that we are responding to the needs of the consumer, which is the shift towards consumables, is a really significant step forward for us and that we're introducing consumable products, especially on the Dollar Tree side, that the consumer is responding to.\n Now when I talk about our discretionary, I think it's also important for everyone in this call to realize that our discretionary is a little bit different than what you'd see out in the marketplace. Our discretionary tends to be high-value items that you can compare to another operator, another retailer, and see a significant difference in the retail price point. So that's part of the reason I'm still very bullish on where we are with discretionary.\n Now as this shift continues, the advantage for us is twofold. Number one, private brands, and the amount of work that's being done on private brands. And what I'd like to say is not just on the consumable side. Our private brand effort includes HVAC or HBC and all of the higher-margin private label products. So that's another way for us to accelerate the margin on the consumable side. And let's not forget shrink, when you think about the pressure that we're experiencing, shrink tends to be cyclical. And what happens with shrink is we all work to mitigate it. If you can't, all costs that can't be taken out it passed on the consumer eventually. So we're keeping an eye on it.\n And I would say, John, again, as we talk about margin, the shrink issue, we have 4 classes of shrink stores, with 4 being the highest. The shrink impact is pretty uniform through all 4 classes which I've never seen that in my career, which is truly fascinating. So in regards to the fresh concept, right now, we are committed to frozen food and refrigerated, which is one of the highest growing categories with our particular consumer. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I wanted to ask about Dollar Tree Plus, I also wanted to ask about the $1.25 price point at Dollar Tree. Can you talk about, I guess, the trade-off here of maybe accelerating a move to higher price points given some of the higher cost pressures, given some of the margin headwinds? Just the trade-off, given how the consumer is behaving and then maybe speeding up Dollar Tree Plus rollout to more stores? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, 2 good questions there. We are very excited what we're seeing with Dollar Tree Plus, and our intent is to move that along as fast as we can. The same thing with the $3, $4, $5 frozen food. The change in the basket when those items goes in is significant.\n The price point thing, Rick McNeely, our Chief Merchant, is actually experimenting with a couple more price points in certain stores, and there has been no consumer resistance. I think once we broke the dollar, I think that any backlash on that is behind us. And what Rick is doing, incrementally priced SKUs are not a repetition of what we already have. So we're creating a bigger basket and a broader shopping experience. \nJeffrey Davis: If I could just add to that. One of the things that the merchant team is really focused on the whole situation is always making sure that they're giving more value in relation to the market at every price. And while some of our prices in relation to where we were previously embracing the dollar at a higher price point, continue to have that price separation and value separation against other competitors in the marketplace. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: So first on shrink. Just quickly, could you just walk us through the surprise there? I would think that shrink would be tied to, like, a year in inventory count, so I'm just curious as to what happened there.\n And then Rick, for you. Big picture, we all see the potential here and we hear you that nothing changes with all this. But the base that we're looking at as a starting point has been going down. And I'm sure you joined because you saw potential for significantly higher earnings than you're going to be at $6 this year. But I guess the question is the timing around the inflection. And you mentioned sort of 3 years, but like how quickly do you think we can begin to see that acceleration? \nJeffrey Davis: This is Jeff. I'll take the first part of the question regarding shrink. When we gave our guidance for the year, we had approximately less than 10% of our stores have taken their inventories for the year. And while we did see some elevation in that shrink, that was embedded in our guidance for the year. As we move through the course of the quarter, we saw a pretty rapid increase in the level of shrink that was being experienced by the stores. And as Rick has said, we were seeing that across all strength classes, which was really out of the normal for us. That's the reason why we needed to make the adjustment.\n So through this period of time, we only have a little less than 40% of our stores that have taken their inventories. We are anticipating that what we're seeing today could accelerate even further because we still have a number of our higher shrink class stores still left, and that's what's being reflected in the adjustment that we had for the year. But based upon what we know today, based upon some other leading indicators, we believe that the adjustment we make is most appropriate. This is not unlike what you're seeing in many other retailers across the industry. Some of this is societal, some of it is economic, some of it, of course, is particular to us. And we're taking all the appropriate steps that we can to control and mitigate this where we can. \nRichard Dreiling: Then, Ed, on the second part of your question, the first thing I'd like to say is we intend to highlight a lot of that question at the Investor Day, which will give you a little more clarity to how it's going to shake down and how quick it's going to come.\n A couple of comments, though, prior to that. Number one, I am very bullish on the opportunity here. And I do think if we are realistic, this consumable shift and the shrink impact are transitory. I do not believe we're going to be living with them forever, and that is all accretive to what we're doing. And then you throw in -- and all of this, Ed, is in motion now, the move to the [ 78-inch ] profile. We're going to add almost 1,000 new SKUs. The work on Dollar Tree Plus, the expanded coolers, the expanded frozen food, the improvement in the physical store facilities. We're reducing our turnover. There's already proof of that by the wage investments we've made, which is going to help us in so many other areas.\n So what I'd like to say, there's a lot in motion, I am incredibly confident and optimistic, and we'll lay this out for you in more detail at the Investor Day. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. \nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli. A lot of your initiatives like expanding cooler doors and frozen foods have been focused on driving consumable sales, and that's obviously the driver to the transaction growth, as you've highlighted. But Rick, like as the consumer behavior starts to stabilize, how do you shift consumers back to buying more discretionary goods? Because in theory, your consumable sales gain should be sustainable. And if we look at Dollar General as an example, like their consumable sales spiked during the great recession, but then consumables continue to become a bigger part of their sales pie every year up until the pandemic. So like, how do you actually change that trend once the consumer starts to normalize? \nRichard Dreiling: Another great question. And I would say this, and no offense to anybody prior to me. Somewhere along the line, we have confused value and cheap. Our consumer is looking for value, and value means that -- it's the classic story I can remember years ago, people -- somebody bought a rake in one of our stores, took it home, used it 1 day and it was broken. Well, that was cheap, but that's not value. And how we are going to manage this, we're doing a better job of procuring products and bringing the right selection in.\n The people at Dollar Tree are making their first trip to China in over 3 years, and we're really excited. Now, they'll be able to stand face-to-face with the manufacturer and the vendor and be able to see and hold and feel what they're going to bring into the store. And then the other thing, Scot, to be frank, the consumer is going to make that choice. If we have the right products, the right selection and we promote value, the consumer is going to gravitate there anyway. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. \nPeter Keith: So the transaction comps are pretty impressive and nice to see. I'm curious with the economic backdrop, what type of trade-in/track-down benefit you're seeing? Obviously, you're getting more customers in stores. Is this repeat behavior? Or are you starting to see new customers that you can track behavior on? \nRichard Dreiling: We're actually seeing new customers. Our core customer is coming more frequently. Now when they come, they don't spend any more, but they come more often. And what we're now seeing is the trade down in that $80,000 income range, and we're actually beginning to target that consumer, and that consumer is more wrapped up in the consumable business.\n And one of the things that Jeff highlighted, I hope that everybody caught was the improvement in our service level to the stores, which is significant. And that service level improvement is become -- comes from giving the stores what they want when they order it, and they're drawing consumables at a much higher rate down. And then what happens, when that higher income consumer comes in, they're used to a certain in-stock level, and we're now able to do a better job of satisfying that, which is why we're seeing that trade down. \nJeffrey Davis: And Peter, just to give you a little more dimensionalization. Across both banners, they are averaging about $3 million net new customers over a trailing 12-month period. So you are seeing that customer -- a new customer coming to us. We're seeing that customer shop across the entire store across consumables and discretionary. And as Rick has mentioned, our ability to make sure that we have the right store environment such that they want to come back is an important element for us. That's the reason why we want to continue improving our store standards and delivery and service to those stores. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Karen Short from Credit Suisse. \nKaren Short: Look forward to seeing you in a few weeks. I just wanted to ask a couple of things. So on overall margin structure within the Dollar Tree banner, so is it fair to say as we get through the year, you'll have more benefit from freight? So what we're looking at right now is not necessarily the run rate, but there is a mix shift and then that will be offset a little more impactfully in the second half of the year on freight.\n But then the second bigger thing I wanted to ask is I know you're doing a test on consolidating a distribution center and wondering if you could give some updates on that as it relates to what that could look like as a much bigger rollout as we go forward. \nRichard Dreiling: I'll take the second. \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. So on the first portion of the question with respect to margins at Dollar Tree, we had stated earlier that our expectation is we'd be able to manage that business over the course of the year to a 36% to 37% gross margin rate. And there's lots that goes into that, of course, not only product costs but shrink markdowns on some other elements.\n Today, as we look in our guidance, I would say that we would be at the lower end of that range, but we feel comfortable that we will be able to continue managing the business based upon our product offering and how the customer behaviors have been in that 36%, 37% range, so at the lower end of that. There's just a number of elements we believe that we still have to work to from a product offering basis as we look at the introduction of new price points and able to capture a little more margin where previously we weren't able to do so at some of the lower price points. \nRichard Dreiling: Then in regards to the question concerning combined warehouses, we're opening on the process of building one in Florida. We had one in Utah, and we actually converted it to Family Dollar only. It's one of those propositions that sounds easy, makes sense but it tends to be a little more difficult to execute. And what John and Mike have done for us is we've have done -- and which we'll share at the Investor Day, we've done a total analysis of the system. And at the end of the day, this really boils down to stem miles and how far away the distribution center is from the stores.\n And I have no opinion, I'm not sold that we need to do it, but I'm not sold that we don't need to do it. But we need to spend a little more time with it. And we're going to give you our thoughts on a more broader base at the investor conference. And then we'll probably have an answer in the next 6 or 7 months where we would go ultimately on a combined warehouse. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Matthew Boss. \nMatthew Boss: So Rick, at the Dollar Tree banner, could you speak to the economy that you're seeing between the traffic improvement, which obviously is a nice positive, relative to the average ticket decline that you're experiencing? And then just what are you seeing with recent trends to support the sequential comp acceleration that you embedded in your second quarter guidance at the Dollar Tree banner? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. I don't want to give a mid-quarter guidance here. It's we're only 3 weeks -- 3.5 weeks into the quarter. But I will tell you, I am very pleased with the trends and the transaction counts have not changed.\n I -- Matt, when I look at this, we always want to look at the basket, and I've always believed that footsteps ultimately drive the basket. And I am very pleased with what we're seeing with transactions, and I think the transaction growth we have is leading to the comp sales that we're driving at Dollar Tree. So I remain very, very bullish on both banners at this stage of the game. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe Feldman. \nJoseph Feldman: I guess I wanted to go back on the consumables mix, I guess, we all kind of understand the environment we're in. And I guess I'm a little curious as to what was different in the quarter than you expected. It seems like it did accelerate the mix pressure. And you also made reference to an earlier question that you were still -- the discretionary business sounded like it wasn't that bad from your perspective. And I wanted a little more color on performance of discretionary, I guess, if you could share it? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Maybe we'll tag team that, if that's okay, and I'll start. \nJeffrey Davis: Yes, yes. \nRichard Dreiling: If you go back to the last earnings call, we did call out that we were starting to see a shift in shrink and the drive towards consumables. Now there's absolutely no doubt over the last 12, 15 weeks that call out has accelerated. And I think the consumer is feeling the real pressure now of a lot of things that have taken place. We've had change in SNAP benefits, tax returns are smaller than this time last year, all the stimulus is out of the system, and all of that is taking root. And the consumer now is more focused on needs and buying to those needs as close as they can versus wants, and that's the shift we've seen. Now we think that shift is going to continue for a while. We don't particularly believe it's going to get any worse. I can't remember the second part of the question. \nJoseph Feldman: I was just asking discretionary. Yes. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. The reason I bring up discretionary, I think it's really important. Really important. Our discretionary business is still good, and the fact is we've strengthened the consumables side. So we shouldn't be making the assumption that our low-cost pertinent discretionary items are no longer wanted or needed by the customer. It's that they're buying more consumables.\n Jeffrey, I don't know if you have anything to add? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. I was just going to add a little -- provide a little dimension on the acceleration of consumables. \n So in the fourth quarter, you may recall that for Dollar Tree, on a year-over-year basis, they were flat in their mix, and Family Dollar was about 120 basis point shift into consumables. If you fast forward to the first quarter of this year, Dollar Tree is now 180 basis points shift into consumables and Family Dollar was 200 basis points, so you saw a pretty significant, on a year-over-year basis, shift more into the consumables. And that's what our financials have reflected, but that should hopefully give you a indication of just the quantum of what that shift is.\n And if you think on a margin basis, what that does for you is that there's about a full 20-point differential in your gross and your initial margins between discretionary and consumables. So when that dollar shifts from discretionary into consumables on average, you're losing 20 points of initial margin. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Lasser from UBS. \nMichael Lasser: One of the hallmarks of your and your team tenure in the previous retail situation is that you would consistently underpromise and overdeliver and generate consistent and reliable performance. This experience has been colored by surprises due to factors like reinvestment and unanticipated costs such as shrink and mix. At what point do you think Dollar Tree is going to get into the cycle of greater consistency? Is it realistic that, that could happen in the second half of this year?\n Also, as part of this question, I'm going to put in a second one. The market was focused on Dollar Tree's ability to earn $8 in '24 and potentially $10 in '25. Given these factors that you've outlined today, is it realistic that the market should push off those expectations in light of everything you know?\n And then lastly, you've alluded to this incremental price points above $1.25, presumably, that's above $1.25, but below $3. Can you give us more detail on that? It sparked a lot of interest so far this morning. \nRichard Dreiling: So I'll take the first part, let Jeff handle the second. Underpromise, overdeliver, I think, has been the mantra of my career, and I cannot deny that. But I will make a couple of comments.\n Number one, when we started the journey at my previous employer, we were priced. We did not do it in the public arena. And what you're seeing is a lot of the maturations we went through a long, long time ago. I do believe we are on the right path. I do believe all the things we're doing are right, and I do believe there's a payoff coming. And what we will do at the Investor Day is we're going to show you that map. And what I'd like to do is hold on until that time, Michael. So I can -- so we can stand up there with charts and graphs and show you the journey.\n But I think we are getting this level set now. Every day, we find something new we didn't know about, and we're going to have to go out and get it fixed. And this is a journey, and I've got the right people around me. I've got 200,000 people that are excited, that are dying to be led. And we just need a little bit of time, and we're going to lay it all out for you in about 4 weeks.\n Jeffrey, I'll let you handle that. \nJeffrey Davis: The only thing I would add to that is that we are very confident that we will be able to deliver double-digit EPS. And the actions to get there, we are embarked upon currently. As Rick has said, we are confident in what we're doing. You're starting to see some of the results from a top line perspective. The components of how we get there and the time frame that we get there would be best illustrated when we get to the Investor Day, and we don't want to take anything away from that period of time. But we are confident the double-digit EPS is in our near-term horizon. \nMichael Lasser: I think on the price point, [indiscernible]? \nRichard Dreiling: Multi-price. \nJeffrey Davis: I'm sorry. The specific question on multi-price? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Could you say it again, sir? \nMichael Lasser: Yes. So you have alluded to testing several times on this call, incremental price point. The interpretation is that those are above $1.25, but below the Dollar Tree Plus price point of $3 and $5 items. So if you could elaborate on that test, it will be super helpful. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. To answer your question, at this stage of the game, north of $1.25 and less than $5. That is a correct assumption. That doesn't mean that's where we're going to land when this is all said and done. But yes, we are -- that was -- that's very fair, between $1.25 and $5 is where we're at right now with no duplication of the SKU. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: Just wanted to quickly follow up on some of the increased pressure points on margins. Could you just talk about how you see the promotional environment evolve from here? And I know you said that currently, it's still very rational. But in case some of the larger players do pick up price investments, can you just talk about how much you can potentially lean on to your vendors, better source? And I think, Rick, you said that you view shrink as something that is cyclical. But can you just talk about some of the steps that you can take right now to mitigate it? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. I'll talk about the promotional environment. I'll reinforce that it's very stable right now. And I will also tell you this, we are generating, on the Family Dollar side, vendor relationships we have not had in a very, very long time in this banner. And those vendor relationships are driven by our ability to execute on the commitments we make to the vendor and the manufacturer. And it is -- and that's how you get the incremental support for incremental markdowns in case you have to go to battle in print.\n However, I do not see that. I think the market is as rational as I have ever seen.\n Anything you want to take, Jeff? \nJeffrey Davis: Yes. On shrink, it's a multifaceted sort of approach. You definitely start off with a sense of merchandising, where there's opportunities for us in some situations to how you display items, what restrictions you have and how that banner is displayed. And those are the types of things that we don't particularly care for because we know that, that impacts sales, but it's an inevitable portion. We introduced new technologies within the store, how we monitor and alerts. We take such steps quite honestly in working more closely with local law enforcement to the extent that there is elevated levels with systemic communities.\n But also, as we have been really focused on our turnover and getting certain key positions filled and continue to be in position, that also helps us from a turnover perspective, which is -- also helps afford some of the internal elements of our shrink. So once again, very multifaceted, and we will work all across that.\n In the eventuality that this is something that we -- is at elevated levels, and we're going to have to pass some element of this on to our consumer, we'll ultimately have to think about how we will price this into some of our merchandise. \nRichard Dreiling: Krisztina, I'd add one last thing, too. Shrink tends to fall into certain categories. And in our higher shrink stores we're actually exploring, do we need the same assortment as a low shrink category store? So those are the kinds of things we're looking forward. To Jeff's point, we're looking at everything right now to mitigate the problem. \nOperator: Now, I will hand over back to Randy Guiler. Please go ahead, sir. \nRandy Guiler: Thank you for joining us today, and we hope to see you at our investor conference on June 21. Have a good day. \nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Dreiling",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. As many of you are aware, Dollar Tree will be hosting its investor conference in 4 weeks on June 21 in Norfolk, Virginia, near our corporate headquarters. The conference will be webcast, and I hope to see many of you at this important event. Our investor conference has been overdue, and we understand the level of anticipation for many investors. I hope next month's gathering will provide each of you a better understanding of the transformation taking shape and the speed with which we are making these changes to increase both our productivity and profitability at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.\n We have been hard at work building the team we need to drive the transformation of this business. The more we dig in, the more historically clear the opportunity becomes, and we are on our way to most fully realize upon it. Our stores are of comparable size to those of our closest peers, but they generate far less revenue per store. We understand why, and we know how to close the gap. There are no structural impediments to our progressing towards this goal. As we do, we will drive growth and gain market share. With the operating leverage embedded in the retail model, accelerating growth in revenue per store will translate into higher margins, and higher margins will increase our return on capital and fueling accelerated store growth. We've gone down this road before, and we know the way. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve both of our segments, and we are pursuing that with vigor.\n While our enterprise-wide transformation is still in the early stages, we are already seeing results. Our early initiatives have begun to deliver growth and market share gains. We are driving this transformation in the most dynamic retail environment I have seen in my career. While this volatility is real and will generate bumps along the way, it will not affect where this great adventure ends.\n In addition to the historic levels of inflation and labor market challenges, retailers have seen in just the past quarter, elevated levels of shrink and even further pressure on the consumers' willingness to spend on discretionary goods, shrink and the mix shift from discretionary goods have pressured margins throughout retail. We are no exception. Ultimately, shrink will either be resolved through defensive merchandising, store closures and/or through government action at the local level. Regarding the near-term unfavorable impact of consumables mix, we believe consumer shopping behavior will normalize over time and the margin profile will rebound.\n We are acutely attuned to each of these bumps. In the end, none will materially affect our delivering on the promise of this transformation unless we allow them to distract us from what we know we have to do, and we will not allow that to happen.\n We bench our top line sales performance primarily on 3 specific metrics. Sales per square foot growth, growth in transaction count and unit sales or volume growth. Based on these 3 metrics, I am pleased with our quarter 1 performance and the direction we are headed. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong. Most significantly, we continue to gain market share, and our traffic and unit volume growth are driving strong top line momentum. The market share gains are a clear validation of the actions that we have taken on pricing and wages and the ongoing improvements we have made in our merchandise assortment, service level and store standards.\n Now, despite our commercial success and building momentum, we are experiencing near-term margin pressures from the macro factors impacting sales mix and elevated shrink. But the most important message that I want to convey today is that we remain completely focused on delivering on our full potential and are executing on our transformation investments at full speed.\n I will now review the highlights for quarter 1. Following my remarks, Jeff will provide a detailed overview of our financial performance and our updated 2023 outlook. For the quarter, we delivered $7.32 billion in sales, an increase of 6.1%, with enterprise comp growth of 4.8% and operating income of $419.7 million, leading to EPS of $1.35 and adjusted EPS of $1.47, when adjusting for a $30 million accrual related to pending legal matters regarding our West Memphis distribution center. Our merchandising and execution remain strong, with comp increases of 3.4% at Dollar Tree and 6.6% at Family Dollar. The underlying sales strength was concentrated in consumables and driven by meaningful transaction growth across both segments.  \n Results were even more impressive in the context of Dollar Tree's 11.2% comp increase from a year ago. After fully cycling the $1.25 price point in February, customer traffic remained very favorable at Dollar Tree as comparable traffic count increased by 5.5%. Notably, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in comps at Family Dollar, with comp traffic up 4.3%.\n For nearly all of 2022 comp traffic counts trends in both segments were negative, so quarter 1 was an important inflection point for the company, with traffic increasing both sequentially and year-over-year.\n The turnaround at Family Dollar is gaining meaningful traction. In addition to the improving traffic, Family Dollar's comp was driven by a 2.2% increase in average ticket. At Family Dollar, we increased our private brand penetration by approximately 80 basis points. Moving forward, we expect to continue growing private brands penetration as we further improve merchandise, presentation, packaging and quality control standards. For example, we recently opened a new test kitchen here in Chesapeake and are excited about our growing pipeline of private brand products across consumables, health and beauty and other high-growth categories. We are also encouraged by the margin opportunities associated with expanding our private brands business.\n Last year, we took pricing actions at Family Dollar to bring us more in line with our most direct competition. These price investments strengthen our value offering at Family Dollar and followed our transition to the $1.25 price point at Dollar Tree, along with investments in wages and store standards, the steps we have taken on pricing across both segments are critical to improving our long-term financial and operating performance. As I mentioned earlier, the consumer continues to be under pressure. There are simply fewer dollars available to them, and those dollars are not going as far as they did a year or 2 ago. We are past the multiple rounds of government stimulus. SNAP dollars have been reduced and tax refunds are running lower. These impacts, combined with persistent inflation, have more families prioritizing needs over wants.\n Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are part of the solution for shoppers buying for need and close to need as they look to stretch their paychecks. Our stores are nearby, easy to shop, and provide tremendous value. While these factors are contributing to the mix shift and pressuring our gross margins, they are also driving more shoppers into our stores with increased frequency. We will continue to respond to the needs of the consumer across both consumables and discretionary categories by offering tremendous value and a great selection. While this mix shift towards consumables is clearly a margin headwind, it is worth noting that the promotional environment remains rational and is not driving any additional margin pressure.\n At Dollar Tree, we made great strides with our multi-price strategy, and we remain on track to add $3 and $5-plus items to another 1,800 stores this year. In quarter 1, we added Dollar Tree Plus assortments to more than 400 stores and anticipate accelerating the pace of this rollout over the balance of the year. Additionally, we have aggressively expanded our product assortment at Dollar Tree stores with $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated products, adding 3,500 stores last year alone on this initiative.\n During the first quarter, we added multi-price frozen and refrigerated doors and more than 400 Dollar Tree stores. Both our Dollar Trees Plus and our multi-price frozen assortments drive incremental sales, with average ticket more than doubling its stores that we have added this expanded offering. Consumers are clearly responding, and the sales driving initiatives are already having a measurable impact on our results.\n Family Dollar, we are on track to add 16,000 new cooler doors in 2023. This is helping drive Family Dollar to its highest market share in close to 4 years as measured by quarter 1 dollar volume. On a unit volume basis, Family Dollar's quarter 1 share of industry growth was the highest in more than 3 years. We continue to improve the in-store experience at Family Dollar and completed more than 250 store renovations in the quarter.\n On last quarter's call, I shared the strategic rationale for our increased SG&A spending in 2023. These investments should be pursued as rapidly as our management bandwidth will allow. The sooner each is implemented, the sooner we will enjoy the benefits and the greater impact of our other investments. All of this is ultimately connected and interdependent. Many of our investments will be ongoing, including those on our associates and store conditions, and again, the results are starting to come in. We have already seen meaningful improvements in sales momentum and reduced associate turnover.\n In closing, we have a plan. I'm confident this plan will drive meaningful top line growth, increase productivity and improve profitability. We are vigorously executing on it. We will not allow bumps in the road to distract us or slow us down, and it's clear it's starting to work. Our investments in price, our stores, our merchandise and our associates have already begun delivering results.\n We will get to where we're going, but how we get there matters as well. I firmly believe that investments in our people and the communities we serve are the cornerstones of a successful retailer. We have taken a comprehensive approach to improve wages and benefits for our people and to increase associate engagement to make Dollar Tree and Family Dollar great places to work and grow. It is vital for the continued success of our organization to have a strong culture. While there is work to be done, we are pleased that our culture efforts are taking root and building the foundation for a thriving future.\n Finally, I am so very proud of the tremendous efforts of our 200,000-plus associates, each of whom has contributed to the great progress we are making and each of whom deserves our collective thanks.\n While Jeff will cover our outlook in more detail, I want to emphasize that we remain confident in the outlook for our business and our continued sales momentum. Our go-to-market strategies at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are working and clearly resonating with consumers. I look forward to sharing more detail on our long-term vision and our multiyear outlook next month at our investor conference.\n I will now turn the call over to Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. We are continuing to execute at a high level and acting with urgency around our business transformation, and I am pleased with our solid start to 2023. We are looking forward to our investor conference next month, where we expect to provide our investors and analysts with a multiyear outlook for the business, including a substantive and comprehensive overview of the key elements of our business. Our team has identified multiple levers to unlock value, and we have strong underlying business momentum that positions us favorably in the current retail and economic environment. We see a path to greater earnings power over the next 3 years and look forward to sharing our plans in more detail next month.\n I also want to take this opportunity to welcome our new Supply Chain Officer, Mike Kindy. I have worked with Mike in previous organizations, and he is a proven subject matter expert and thought leader in supply chain and logistics. I am very confident that Mike will demonstrate continued success at Dollar Tree based on his past record. I also want to thank John Flanagan for his contributions, which helped us get to where we are today. While John communicated to us at the outset is desired to serve only for a short period, over the past year, john has led our supply chain strategy and has overseen the early stages of the process to optimize our distribution network and he's had a tremendous impact.\n We are moving at a fast pace in our journey to fundamentally reposition our combined retailing operations for sustainable long-term growth. Our efforts are already paying off in the form of significant market share gains at both segments. Both formats have a clear runway for accelerated growth in productivity and profitability. Our leaders have complete ownership over the factors that will shape our outlook for the next 3 to 5 years. We have a winning team of more than 200,000 associates who are highly motivated and eager to succeed. I look forward to sharing more next month at our conference.\n And one last note. Before we go to Q&A, I want to share some IR news with you. Several months ago, Randy Guiler communicated with us his retirement plans. This advanced notification provided us with ample opportunity to seek Randy's replacement. I want to thank Randy for his 9 years of dedicated service leading the IR function at Dollar Tree. I am pleased to share that [ Bob LaFleur ] joined Dollar Tree on Monday of this week as our new SVP of Investor Relations. Randy will be with us at our upcoming investor conference and is continuing in his current role with the company through the month of June to help facilitate a smooth transition. Please join me in congratulating Randy on his impending retirement, and Bob on his new role at Dollar Tree.\n Operator, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions. Thank you, John. Great question. There's a lot of meat answering that question. The first thing I'd like to say is the strength that we are experiencing consumables has nothing to do with weakness in our discretionary. The fact that we are responding to the needs of the consumer, which is the shift towards consumables, is a really significant step forward for us and that we're introducing consumable products, especially on the Dollar Tree side, that the consumer is responding to.\n Now when I talk about our discretionary, I think it's also important for everyone in this call to realize that our discretionary is a little bit different than what you'd see out in the marketplace. Our discretionary tends to be high-value items that you can compare to another operator, another retailer, and see a significant difference in the retail price point. So that's part of the reason I'm still very bullish on where we are with discretionary.\n Now as this shift continues, the advantage for us is twofold. Number one, private brands, and the amount of work that's being done on private brands. And what I'd like to say is not just on the consumable side. Our private brand effort includes HVAC or HBC and all of the higher-margin private label products. So that's another way for us to accelerate the margin on the consumable side. And let's not forget shrink, when you think about the pressure that we're experiencing, shrink tends to be cyclical. And what happens with shrink is we all work to mitigate it. If you can't, all costs that can't be taken out it passed on the consumer eventually. So we're keeping an eye on it.\n And I would say, John, again, as we talk about margin, the shrink issue, we have 4 classes of shrink stores, with 4 being the highest. The shrink impact is pretty uniform through all 4 classes which I've never seen that in my career, which is truly fascinating. So in regards to the fresh concept, right now, we are committed to frozen food and refrigerated, which is one of the highest growing categories with our particular consumer. Yes, 2 good questions there. We are very excited what we're seeing with Dollar Tree Plus, and our intent is to move that along as fast as we can. The same thing with the $3, $4, $5 frozen food. The change in the basket when those items goes in is significant.\n The price point thing, Rick McNeely, our Chief Merchant, is actually experimenting with a couple more price points in certain stores, and there has been no consumer resistance. I think once we broke the dollar, I think that any backlash on that is behind us. And what Rick is doing, incrementally priced SKUs are not a repetition of what we already have. So we're creating a bigger basket and a broader shopping experience. Then, Ed, on the second part of your question, the first thing I'd like to say is we intend to highlight a lot of that question at the Investor Day, which will give you a little more clarity to how it's going to shake down and how quick it's going to come.\n A couple of comments, though, prior to that. Number one, I am very bullish on the opportunity here. And I do think if we are realistic, this consumable shift and the shrink impact are transitory. I do not believe we're going to be living with them forever, and that is all accretive to what we're doing. And then you throw in -- and all of this, Ed, is in motion now, the move to the [ 78-inch ] profile. We're going to add almost 1,000 new SKUs. The work on Dollar Tree Plus, the expanded coolers, the expanded frozen food, the improvement in the physical store facilities. We're reducing our turnover. There's already proof of that by the wage investments we've made, which is going to help us in so many other areas.\n So what I'd like to say, there's a lot in motion, I am incredibly confident and optimistic, and we'll lay this out for you in more detail at the Investor Day. Another great question. And I would say this, and no offense to anybody prior to me. Somewhere along the line, we have confused value and cheap. Our consumer is looking for value, and value means that -- it's the classic story I can remember years ago, people -- somebody bought a rake in one of our stores, took it home, used it 1 day and it was broken. Well, that was cheap, but that's not value. And how we are going to manage this, we're doing a better job of procuring products and bringing the right selection in.\n The people at Dollar Tree are making their first trip to China in over 3 years, and we're really excited. Now, they'll be able to stand face-to-face with the manufacturer and the vendor and be able to see and hold and feel what they're going to bring into the store. And then the other thing, Scot, to be frank, the consumer is going to make that choice. If we have the right products, the right selection and we promote value, the consumer is going to gravitate there anyway. We're actually seeing new customers. Our core customer is coming more frequently. Now when they come, they don't spend any more, but they come more often. And what we're now seeing is the trade down in that $80,000 income range, and we're actually beginning to target that consumer, and that consumer is more wrapped up in the consumable business.\n And one of the things that Jeff highlighted, I hope that everybody caught was the improvement in our service level to the stores, which is significant. And that service level improvement is become -- comes from giving the stores what they want when they order it, and they're drawing consumables at a much higher rate down. And then what happens, when that higher income consumer comes in, they're used to a certain in-stock level, and we're now able to do a better job of satisfying that, which is why we're seeing that trade down. I'll take the second. Then in regards to the question concerning combined warehouses, we're opening on the process of building one in Florida. We had one in Utah, and we actually converted it to Family Dollar only. It's one of those propositions that sounds easy, makes sense but it tends to be a little more difficult to execute. And what John and Mike have done for us is we've have done -- and which we'll share at the Investor Day, we've done a total analysis of the system. And at the end of the day, this really boils down to stem miles and how far away the distribution center is from the stores.\n And I have no opinion, I'm not sold that we need to do it, but I'm not sold that we don't need to do it. But we need to spend a little more time with it. And we're going to give you our thoughts on a more broader base at the investor conference. And then we'll probably have an answer in the next 6 or 7 months where we would go ultimately on a combined warehouse. Yes. I don't want to give a mid-quarter guidance here. It's we're only 3 weeks -- 3.5 weeks into the quarter. But I will tell you, I am very pleased with the trends and the transaction counts have not changed.\n I -- Matt, when I look at this, we always want to look at the basket, and I've always believed that footsteps ultimately drive the basket. And I am very pleased with what we're seeing with transactions, and I think the transaction growth we have is leading to the comp sales that we're driving at Dollar Tree. So I remain very, very bullish on both banners at this stage of the game. Yes. Maybe we'll tag team that, if that's okay, and I'll start. If you go back to the last earnings call, we did call out that we were starting to see a shift in shrink and the drive towards consumables. Now there's absolutely no doubt over the last 12, 15 weeks that call out has accelerated. And I think the consumer is feeling the real pressure now of a lot of things that have taken place. We've had change in SNAP benefits, tax returns are smaller than this time last year, all the stimulus is out of the system, and all of that is taking root. And the consumer now is more focused on needs and buying to those needs as close as they can versus wants, and that's the shift we've seen. Now we think that shift is going to continue for a while. We don't particularly believe it's going to get any worse. I can't remember the second part of the question. Yes. The reason I bring up discretionary, I think it's really important. Really important. Our discretionary business is still good, and the fact is we've strengthened the consumables side. So we shouldn't be making the assumption that our low-cost pertinent discretionary items are no longer wanted or needed by the customer. It's that they're buying more consumables.\n Jeffrey, I don't know if you have anything to add? So I'll take the first part, let Jeff handle the second. Underpromise, overdeliver, I think, has been the mantra of my career, and I cannot deny that. But I will make a couple of comments.\n Number one, when we started the journey at my previous employer, we were priced. We did not do it in the public arena. And what you're seeing is a lot of the maturations we went through a long, long time ago. I do believe we are on the right path. I do believe all the things we're doing are right, and I do believe there's a payoff coming. And what we will do at the Investor Day is we're going to show you that map. And what I'd like to do is hold on until that time, Michael. So I can -- so we can stand up there with charts and graphs and show you the journey.\n But I think we are getting this level set now. Every day, we find something new we didn't know about, and we're going to have to go out and get it fixed. And this is a journey, and I've got the right people around me. I've got 200,000 people that are excited, that are dying to be led. And we just need a little bit of time, and we're going to lay it all out for you in about 4 weeks.\n Jeffrey, I'll let you handle that. Multi-price. Yes. Could you say it again, sir? Yes. To answer your question, at this stage of the game, north of $1.25 and less than $5. That is a correct assumption. That doesn't mean that's where we're going to land when this is all said and done. But yes, we are -- that was -- that's very fair, between $1.25 and $5 is where we're at right now with no duplication of the SKU. Yes. I'll talk about the promotional environment. I'll reinforce that it's very stable right now. And I will also tell you this, we are generating, on the Family Dollar side, vendor relationships we have not had in a very, very long time in this banner. And those vendor relationships are driven by our ability to execute on the commitments we make to the vendor and the manufacturer. And it is -- and that's how you get the incremental support for incremental markdowns in case you have to go to battle in print.\n However, I do not see that. I think the market is as rational as I have ever seen.\n Anything you want to take, Jeff? Krisztina, I'd add one last thing, too. Shrink tends to fall into certain categories. And in our higher shrink stores we're actually exploring, do we need the same assortment as a low shrink category store? So those are the kinds of things we're looking forward. To Jeff's point, we're looking at everything right now to mitigate the problem."

            "name": "Jeffrey Davis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, our top line performance was strong in both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. It was driven by meaningful growth in customer traffic, continued market share gains and an increase in underlying unit growth. Total sales increased 6.1% to $7.3 billion based on comp store sales growth of 4.8%. Traffic increased 5% on a consolidated basis, and average ticket was down slightly. Across the enterprise, our sales mix of consumables increased approximately 200 basis points as customer purchase behavior responded to deteriorating macro conditions.\n Our service levels were particularly strong in Q1. In-stock positions improved by 400 basis points in the Dollar Tree segment and by 200 basis points at Family Dollar. Our DC service levels also improved for both segments by nearly 1,600 basis points at Dollar Tree and approximately 500 basis points at Family Dollar.\n Operating income decreased by 43% to $419.1 million. Adjusted operating income decreased by 39% to $449.7 million. Recall that in Q1, we cycled the first full quarter of the $1.25 price point transition at Dollar Tree, which resulted in unfavorable margin comparisons given the outsized benefit we saw in Q1 last year. The variance between operating income and adjusted operating income came from a $30 million accrual related to previously disclosed legal proceedings associated with our Family Dollar distribution center in West Memphis, Arkansas.\n Gross profit decreased by 4.7% to $2.23 billion as gross margin contracted by 340 basis points. The biggest driver of the gross margin decline was merchandise cost. In Q1 last year, we benefited from the rollout of the $1.25 price point at Dollar Tree. In the current period, our sales mix shifted approximately 200 basis points towards lower-margin consumable merchandise. The impact of higher cost of goods and unfavorable sales mix were partially offset by lower freight costs and markdowns as we cycled the impact of our West Memphis DC closure last year.\n As Rick noted, elevated levels of shrink represent a persistent challenge. In Q1, shrink negatively impacted gross margin by 60 basis points and EPS by an incremental $0.14 per share compared to last year. On a business segment basis, Dollar Tree gross margin declined by approximately 530 basis points, primarily from lower merchandise margin based on the higher consumable mix and cycling the initial transition to the $1.25 price point, elevated shrink expense and increased distribution costs.\n We benefited modestly from lower spot rates for ocean freight relative to last year. But to date, this is only impacting a small portion of our shipments with a larger impact of savings from freight rate declines to come in the second half and into the years ahead.\n Family Dollar's gross margin decreased by approximately 100 basis points, with largely the same factors contributing to the decline as Dollar Tree. Specifically, gross margin was negatively impacted by mix, product cost increases, higher shrink and higher distribution costs, partially offset by lower markdowns and lower freight expenses.\n SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased 150 basis points to 24.8%. The biggest driver was wage investments for store and distribution center associates. We also experienced higher store facility costs as we continue to focus on improving store conditions as well as higher professional and marketing expenses.\n Corporate, support and other expenses were 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 10 basis points from last year. Net income was $299 million, and EPS was $1.35 in comparison to $2.37 a year ago. Adjusted net income was $325.1 million and adjusted EPS was $1.47. The $0.12 adjustment was related to the West Memphis legal accrual. Our effective tax rate was 24.1% versus 23.1% last year, reflecting lower stock-based compensation deductions and higher nondeductible expenses, partially offset by higher work opportunity tax credits. Adjusted for the impact of the West Memphis accrual, the Q1 implied tax rate for this year was 23.3% or 20 basis points higher than Q1 last year.\n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, my comments will reflect balance sheet comparisons at the end of Q1 2023 versus Q1 2022. Inventory increased 6.5% primarily from an increase in merchandise costs, DC unit volume growth, the continued rollout of our Dollar Tree multi-price inventory and new store growth. The quality of our inventory remains high and manageable. Q1 capital expenditures were $350.4 million versus $253.4 million. For fiscal 2023, we continue to expect capital expenditures to total approximately $2 billion, with approximately 40% dedicated to business continuity and the balance directed towards growth, optimization and productivity improvement.\n In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $151.1 million, of which $7.7 million did not settle until after quarter end. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $872.8 million compared to $1.2 billion. Our cash position increased $230 million in Q1 from the end of fiscal 2022 led by working capital improvements, partially offset by capital expenditures and share repurchases. Free cash flow improved to $402 million from $285 million last year.\n Moving to our sales and EPS outlook. The company expects consolidated net sales for the second quarter will range from $7 billion to $7.2 billion, based on a mid-single digit increase in comp store sales for the enterprise and for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Diluted EPS for the second quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.89. As a reminder, the bulk of our ocean freight savings for the year will fall in the second half, as previously mentioned.\n With respect to full year fiscal 2023 guidance, recall that fiscal 2023 has a 53rd week. Consolidated sales for the full fiscal year are now expected to range from $30 billion to $30.5 billion. The company expects to deliver a low to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase for the year, comprised of a low to mid-single digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a mid-single digit increase in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow by 3% to 3.5% for the year, with new store growth back-end weighted.\n While we modestly raised the midpoint of our top line guidance, we are incrementally more cautious on our margin outlook, given the growing industry-wide challenges of accelerating shrink, the unfavorable shift in sales mix and their impact on our near-term profitability. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, the impact of these 2 factors on our financial results has intensified.\n We expect that over time, our mix of discretionary will normalize and that we will also improve our performance on shrink through defensive merchandising efforts, real estate optimization and perhaps higher prices to compensate for areas of systematically higher shrink. We expect the combined and continuing full year earnings impact of unfavorable consumables mix and higher shrink is expected to be approximately $0.55 per share in 2023.\n Our modeling considerations for 2023 outlook include the following. We expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $845 million to $850 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million in Q2 and $110 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.1% to 24.3% for the second quarter and 23.9% to 24.1% for fiscal 2023. While our share repurchases are not included in our outlook, we had $1.7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of April 29. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 221.4 million shares for Q2 and 221.6 million shares for the full year.\n For the balance of 2023, we  will work diligently to offset potential margin pressures that could come from elevated levels of discretionary inventory. We are taking actions to mitigate the potential impact of these cost pressures such as further optimizing our promotional spending and vendor allowances, identifying opportunities to further reduce inbound freight costs and managing repairs and maintenance costs. We continue to see full year earnings benefit of $1 per share from lower ocean freight costs this year, which could be significantly weighted towards the back half of the year, and an additional $1 per share benefit in 2024 and beyond.\n As a result of the factors I just outlined, we are revising our diluted GAAP EPS outlook for fiscal 2023 to a range of $5.73 to $6.13, which includes the expected contribution from the 53rd week and the $0.12 legal reserve taken in Q1.\n I will now turn the call back over to Rick for closing remarks. If I could just add to that. One of the things that the merchant team is really focused on the whole situation is always making sure that they're giving more value in relation to the market at every price. And while some of our prices in relation to where we were previously embracing the dollar at a higher price point, continue to have that price separation and value separation against other competitors in the marketplace. This is Jeff. I'll take the first part of the question regarding shrink. When we gave our guidance for the year, we had approximately less than 10% of our stores have taken their inventories for the year. And while we did see some elevation in that shrink, that was embedded in our guidance for the year. As we move through the course of the quarter, we saw a pretty rapid increase in the level of shrink that was being experienced by the stores. And as Rick has said, we were seeing that across all strength classes, which was really out of the normal for us. That's the reason why we needed to make the adjustment.\n So through this period of time, we only have a little less than 40% of our stores that have taken their inventories. We are anticipating that what we're seeing today could accelerate even further because we still have a number of our higher shrink class stores still left, and that's what's being reflected in the adjustment that we had for the year. But based upon what we know today, based upon some other leading indicators, we believe that the adjustment we make is most appropriate. This is not unlike what you're seeing in many other retailers across the industry. Some of this is societal, some of it is economic, some of it, of course, is particular to us. And we're taking all the appropriate steps that we can to control and mitigate this where we can. And Peter, just to give you a little more dimensionalization. Across both banners, they are averaging about $3 million net new customers over a trailing 12-month period. So you are seeing that customer -- a new customer coming to us. We're seeing that customer shop across the entire store across consumables and discretionary. And as Rick has mentioned, our ability to make sure that we have the right store environment such that they want to come back is an important element for us. That's the reason why we want to continue improving our store standards and delivery and service to those stores. Yes. So on the first portion of the question with respect to margins at Dollar Tree, we had stated earlier that our expectation is we'd be able to manage that business over the course of the year to a 36% to 37% gross margin rate. And there's lots that goes into that, of course, not only product costs but shrink markdowns on some other elements.\n Today, as we look in our guidance, I would say that we would be at the lower end of that range, but we feel comfortable that we will be able to continue managing the business based upon our product offering and how the customer behaviors have been in that 36%, 37% range, so at the lower end of that. There's just a number of elements we believe that we still have to work to from a product offering basis as we look at the introduction of new price points and able to capture a little more margin where previously we weren't able to do so at some of the lower price points. Yes, yes. Yes. I was just going to add a little -- provide a little dimension on the acceleration of consumables. \n So in the fourth quarter, you may recall that for Dollar Tree, on a year-over-year basis, they were flat in their mix, and Family Dollar was about 120 basis point shift into consumables. If you fast forward to the first quarter of this year, Dollar Tree is now 180 basis points shift into consumables and Family Dollar was 200 basis points, so you saw a pretty significant, on a year-over-year basis, shift more into the consumables. And that's what our financials have reflected, but that should hopefully give you a indication of just the quantum of what that shift is.\n And if you think on a margin basis, what that does for you is that there's about a full 20-point differential in your gross and your initial margins between discretionary and consumables. So when that dollar shifts from discretionary into consumables on average, you're losing 20 points of initial margin. The only thing I would add to that is that we are very confident that we will be able to deliver double-digit EPS. And the actions to get there, we are embarked upon currently. As Rick has said, we are confident in what we're doing. You're starting to see some of the results from a top line perspective. The components of how we get there and the time frame that we get there would be best illustrated when we get to the Investor Day, and we don't want to take anything away from that period of time. But we are confident the double-digit EPS is in our near-term horizon. I'm sorry. The specific question on multi-price? Yes. On shrink, it's a multifaceted sort of approach. You definitely start off with a sense of merchandising, where there's opportunities for us in some situations to how you display items, what restrictions you have and how that banner is displayed. And those are the types of things that we don't particularly care for because we know that, that impacts sales, but it's an inevitable portion. We introduced new technologies within the store, how we monitor and alerts. We take such steps quite honestly in working more closely with local law enforcement to the extent that there is elevated levels with systemic communities.\n But also, as we have been really focused on our turnover and getting certain key positions filled and continue to be in position, that also helps us from a turnover perspective, which is -- also helps afford some of the internal elements of our shrink. So once again, very multifaceted, and we will work all across that.\n In the eventuality that this is something that we -- is at elevated levels, and we're going to have to pass some element of this on to our consumer, we'll ultimately have to think about how we will price this into some of our merchandise."

Given the number of callers who would like to participate in today's session, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Creedon: Thanks, Bob, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to today's call. This is my first time speaking to you as Interim CEO, following our recent leadership transition. I'm honored that the Board has named me to this role at a critical time in our transformation. To all our stakeholders, please know that I take this responsibility very seriously and with great humility. I also want to thank Rick Dreiling for his leadership and the support he provided to all our associates and leaders. From all of us at Dollar Tree, we wish him the very best. As an organization, our top priorities remain accelerating the growth of Dollar Tree and finalizing the strategic review to identify the optimal ownership structure for Family Dollar. Executing against these objectives is the first priority for this leadership team and our Board. Throughout the strategic review process, we have maintained our operational focus and driven meaningful improvements in Family Dollar sales productivity and profitability. Our ultimate goal remains positioning both banners for long-term success and unlocking value for Dollar Tree shareholders. At the Dollar Tree banner, we're converting stores to our in-line multi-price 3.0 format, opening new stores and improving the in-store experience through renovations and customer service enhancements. We believe there is ample runway ahead for Dollar Tree to meaningfully grow its square footage over a multiyear horizon. Value always resonates with the customer and that is why our business model has stood the test of time across decades and multiple economic cycles. We have made good progress on store conditions and operations, but there is more work to be done. At the end of the day, retail fundamentals are the key to unlocking value at Dollar Tree and I'm confident that we have the right team in place to deliver improved merchandising execution and store standards. One of the things that originally attracted me to Dollar Tree was its culture and clear understanding of what we do and who we serve. We offer unparalleled value and convenience for our customers and our scale provides us with a unique competitive advantage through our procurement power and distribution reach. We empower our associates and support their career aspirations or as we like to say, this is a career not a job. And it is my responsibility to ensure that every aspect of our culture supports this goal. From the many stores in DCs that I've visited in my two plus years at Dollar Tree and from the time I've spent here at home in the store support center, it is clear to me that our leadership team and dedicated associates are aligned and our objectives are in focus, position Dollar Tree for sustainable growth and create value for our fellow shareholders. While I've already talked to many of you in the investment community, I look forward to getting to know many more of you in the days and months ahead. With that, I'd like to share our third quarter highlights and update you on several of our key initiatives. As a reminder, we said that third quarter results were in line with expectations when we announced our leadership transition in early November. In Q3, our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar merchandising efforts produced tangible results and sales came in at the high end of our outlook range. Total net sales got a big boost from our non-comp stores with Dollar Tree non-comp sales contributing over three times more revenue this year. This reflects the increased pace of Dollar Tree store openings overall and the especially strong out-of-the-gate performance of the $0.99 only portfolio. Dollar Tree's comp improved sequentially over Q2 driven by market share gains and positive trends in both traffic and ticket. Family Dollar's comp also improved sequentially with its first positive discretionary comp since 2022. Turning to the current environment and tone of business, customers continue to seek value and many are focused on buying for need and buying closer to the time of that need. We continue to see evidence of belt-tightening, particularly among lower income customers and to a lesser extent among middle and higher income families with young children. While this dynamic remains a discretionary headwind, it does create some opportunities across both banners in consumables as consumption data shows lower and middle income households are increasingly shifting more of their spending toward food at home. Given these trends, it's worth reminding everyone of the strong value proposition we offer at Dollar Tree. A customer that walks in to a typical Dollar Tree store will find over 90% of the products in the store priced at a $1.25. So we offer a powerful solution for customers looking to stretch their dollar. Moving onto Dollar Tree's multi-price rollout, we converted another 720 stores to the 3.0 format in the quarter, bringing the total number of converted stores to approximately 2,300. The converted stores produced approximately 30% of Dollar Tree's total net sales in Q3 and continue to produce comps nicely above our portfolio average. The multi-price 3.0 stores in aggregate produced a 3.3 comp in the quarter with a strong 6.6 consumables comp and a modestly positive discretionary comp. Importantly, comps at these stores are being driven by traffic and ticket in roughly equal proportion. Focusing in on some Q3 category highlights at our 3.0 stores, we saw seven comp across our full seasonal assortment, including a 10 comp for Halloween specific products. Looking out to the balance of the year, we expect to convert an additional 300 to 400 stores to the 3.0 format by the end of Q4. This will put us a bit below the 2,800 figure we provided last quarter, but we are taking our time to ensure that each store is ready for conversion before we give it the final green light. To reiterate what I said last quarter, it's better to get the conversion done right than to get them done fast. That being said, including converted and newly opened stores, we will have approximately 3,000 multi-price 3.0 stores open and operating by year-end, including most of the former $0.99 only stores. And speaking of the former $0.99 only stores, we are just about done with the integration of this portfolio. To-date, we've converted and reopened 158 stores as Dollar Tree's and should finish up the remaining handful of stores by the end of this month. The strong initial sales performance of these stores confirms our original optimism about the quality of these assets and their locations across California and the Southwest. Stepping back and looking at our real estate efforts more broadly, we are well on our way towards meeting our full year goal of opening 600 to 650 new stores. Through the end of Q3, we've opened 567 new stores with over 85% of those coming under the Dollar Tree banner. Year-over-year, we have increased our Dollar Tree store base by over 7% and still see a long growth runway ahead of us given the growing market resonance of multi-price. In supply chain, our team continues to do outstanding work in the face of challenges related to our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma that was destroyed by a tornado. The biggest challenge is elevated stem miles across our network. On top of that absorbing a 158 new $0.99 only stores within a relatively concentrated geography required additional resource allocation. While our newly reopened DC and West Memphis has helped to relieve some of the network pressure, additional measures are needed to restore the network to peak efficiency. To this end, we are working to add new capacity to our network, including replacing the capacity we lost in Marietta. Unload times continue to improve at the stores using rotacarts out of our DCs in West Memphis, Matthews, North Carolina and here in Chesapeake. In Q3, our proactive steps to reduce shrink delivered year-over-year improvements at both banners, particularly Family Dollar. While the expansion of multi-price at Dollar Tree has necessitated some stepped up shrink mitigation efforts, we still saw modest reduction in shrink during the quarter. Now, let me recap some of the operational highlights from the quarter. On a consolidated basis, net sales increased 3.5% to $7.6 billion and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.12. Looking at performance by banner, Dollar Tree segment comp increased 1.8% on a 1.5% increase in traffic and a 0.3% increase in average ticket. This was Dollar Tree's first positive ticket comp since Q4 of 2022. Dollar Tree's Q3 consumable mix was 49.9%, a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points. Mix had been shifting towards consumables by over 200 basis points in each of the previous four quarters. So this is clearly a step in the right direction. Consumable comp was 6.2%, which came on top of an 11.1% comp. Snacks, beverages and candy were the best performing categories. Discretionary comp declined 1.8%, reflecting consumers ongoing focus on needs based purchases. Discretionary comp was modestly positive at the multi-price 3.0 stores in the quarter. Hardware, electronics, healthcare and personal care were our best performing discretionary categories, with additional strength seen in Halloween and textiles at the 3.0 stores. Our soft discretionary demand was consistent with trends we saw across the broader retail industry during the quarter. Based on Nielsen data, Dollar Tree's consumables market share gain accelerated in the quarter, with growth in dollar volume outpacing the industry by 480 basis points and unit volume outpacing by 280 basis points. Before moving onto Family Dollar, let me take a moment to comment on Dollar Tree's recent performance in the context of broader market trends. Given Dollar Tree's particular consumer product and price point mix, its comps are running below our long-term run rate expectations. We attribute this to the unique challenges our customers are facing at this point in the economic cycle, which might not necessarily be aligned with the cycle timing at other retailers. Whether looking at comps or store growth, we believe our multi-year results stack up well against any retailer in the country. With a two-year comp stack of 17%, our consumable business is as strong as ever, but that is only half of Dollar Tree's business. The other half is discretionary. And these are the categories where shoppers have pulled back the most given the cumulative impact of the economic pressures they feel. Moving onto the Family Dollar segment, comp increased 1.9% with the gain driven almost entirely by traffic. Average ticket was flat after three consecutive quarters of declines. Consumables comp increased 1.3%, which came on top of a 6.2% comp increase last year. Discretionary comp increased 3.7%, which was a 540 basis points sequential improvement over Q2. More importantly, Q3 was Family Dollar's first positive discretionary comp since Q4, 2022. Children's apparel, electronics and hardware were the best performing discretionary categories. We believe Family Dollar's positive discretionary results are the direct result of our targeted merchandising efforts. In recent quarters, we adjusted our pricing strategy with more emphasis on value and higher frequency purchase items like everyday home essentials. As part of this strategy, we increased the number of items priced at or below $5. We updated our in-store signage and shelf strips to better communicate our price value image. And we identified additional ways to optimize our planograms to drive sales and space productivity. These initiatives are clearly resonating with our core Family Dollar customer and we are seeing the positive results at the cash register. We are also pleased to report that Family Dollar's renovation and store conversion program is generating positive results. Since the beginning of the program in 2022, we have completed over 1500 projects and year-to-date comps are up by high-single-digits at our H2.5 format stores and by double-digits at our urban extra small box format stores. As a reminder, these formats feature customized product assortments that better meet the needs of our diverse customer base. For example, H2.5 stores include additional coolers, expanded seasonal offerings and an enhanced shopping experience with customized end-caps and space optimization that drive better unit economics. Lastly, on Family Dollar, we estimate reduced SNAP benefits were 30 basis point comp headwind in the quarter. While overall SNAP payments were down by 5% nationally in Q3, we think the comp headwinds from SNAP will continue to moderate over the balance of the year. Shifting gears, we have received questions about the potential impact of tariffs in the new administration. While the situation remains fluid and the exact nature, scope and eventual timing of any new tariffs is not yet clear, we are prepared to act on multiple fronts. Rick McNeely and his team of merchants have many years of experience successfully navigating a variety of tariff landscapes. Back in 2018 and 2019, when we last dealt with this issue, we were able to mitigate the majority of the potential impact by negotiating lower costs with our suppliers, changing product specs or pack sizes or dropping non-economical items. Today, all three of those options are still at our disposal. On top of those, we now have detailed plans in place to shift supply sources for most of our products to alternate countries and multi-price gives us additional flexibility on our product assortment. Based on our scale and our past history of navigating through similar challenges, we believe there is a wide range of potential actions that we can take to help mitigate additional tariffs if and when they materialize. With respect to freight, markets continue to be relatively stable, particularly in relation to domestic freight. On ocean freight, we continue to manage through a fluid environment despite disruptions over the past year in the Red Sea and Panama Canal, as well as the strikes at North American ports. Regarding potential strikes, we are proactively managing our seasonal imports in the event that the East and Gulf Coast ports workers don't approve their tentative contract by the current January deadline. I also want to comment briefly on the proposed Department of Labor overtime rule. Last month, a US District Court in Texas struck down the proposed rule in a decision that applied nationwide. The court invalidated both phases of the threshold increase, the one from this past July and the pending one for next month. We absorb the first increase back in July and won't reverse that change. It remains to be seen whether the current administration will appeal the ruling in its waning days or if the incoming administration will revisit the issue, but we are prepared for various scenarios. We remain committed to completing the formal review of strategic alternatives for Family Dollar, which could include a potential sale, spinoff or other disposition of the business among others. The process is moving forward as planned. While good progress is being made by the team, there remains no set deadline or definitive timeline for completion and at this time we can't comment on any specific outcome. We will continue to share updates when we have new public information. The guideposts of the review remain as always to maximize shareholder value through finding the optimal structure for each banner. We have made solid operational progress at Family Dollar over the past few years, even as our core customer was navigating their way through an extremely challenging macro landscape. We're proud of the work we've accomplished to-date and we look forward to the next steps in the review and for the business. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to offer a few high level comments about the current tone of business and our outlook for the balance of the year. Jeff will cover this in greater detail in his remarks. Our merchandising teams have laid the foundation for a successful year-end holiday season. We're especially excited by our expanded Christmas assortment at Dollar Tree and our ability to deliver exceptional value to consumers at a wider range of price points. While the response to our expanding multi-price assortment continues to be positive, the fourth quarter got off to a softer start given the election and later than usual Thanksgiving timing. That said, we remain optimistic about December. While there are five fewer selling days in total between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, we should get some extra help from Christmas falling in the middle of the week. Our merchant and operation teams have done an excellent job preparing for the holidays. The stores look great and our merchandise assortment is more compelling than it's ever been. Even with these moving pieces, we are confident in our ability to deliver low-single-digit comps in the fourth quarter at both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners. Before I wrap up, I am sure you saw our announcement earlier this morning that Jeff Davis will be stepping down as Chief Financial Officer. The company has launched an external search and to facilitate a smooth transition, Jeff has agreed to remain on board through the filing of our 10-K. Ideally, we plan to announce a successor prior to his departure. We thank Jeff for his service and appreciate the contributions he has made to the business during his time with Dollar Tree. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Davis: Thank you, Mike and good morning. Before I discuss the details of our third quarter results, I want to extend my thanks to our Interim CEO, Mike Creedon; our former Chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling, my finance team and the extended Dollar Tree management team. During my time here I've had the privilege of working with talented colleagues, navigating exciting challenges and celebrating many milestones along the way. I'm proud of what we've accomplished together and I'm confident in this management team and the business strategies that are in place. I remain energized about the future possibilities for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. With that, let's get back to business. As usual, I'll start with a discussion of our quarterly results, and then I'll provide our outlook for the balance of 2024. Where applicable, I will focus on our adjusted results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in our earnings release. Third quarter adjusted EPS increased 16% to $1.12. Overall results benefited from sequential top line improvement at both banners and positive discretionary trends at Family Dollar. Turning to the business results, on a consolidated basis, adjusted operating income was $343 million, a 14% increase from last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by approximately 40 basis points to 4.5%, reflecting a 120 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 80 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.8% compared to 21.8%, reflecting lower workers opportunity tax credits in the current year. Adjusted net income increased 13% to $241 million. Now let's move to our business segment results. At Dollar Tree, adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $466 million. Adjusted operating margin decreased 140 basis points, driven by a 60 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 180 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin improved primarily from lower freight costs, partially offset by markdowns and higher distribution costs. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher depreciation and temporary labor for the 3.0 rollout. At Family Dollar adjusted operating income was $10 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $66 million last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 220 basis points on a 130 basis point increase in gross margin and a 90 basis point decrease in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin increased primarily from lower freight costs, lower markdowns from the OTC recall last year and lower shrink. Adjusted SG&A rate decreased primarily from lower payroll and lower store supplies. Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Total inventory was $5.5 billion flat to last year. With cash and cash equivalents of $698 million and senior notes of $3.4 billion our balance sheet remains strong. Our bank defined leverage at quarter-end stood at approximately 2.4 times. On the cash flow statement, we generated $786 million from operating activities compared to $506 million last year. Capital expenditures were $426 million versus $541 million last year. Our free cash flow improved by $395 million over last year. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our revolver and no commercial paper outstanding. Year-to-date, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock for approximately $404 million which is consistent with our year-to-date free cash flow generation of $389 million. At quarter-end, we had approximately $952 million remaining under our existing share repurchase program. Now let me provide some perspective on our fourth quarter and full year expectations. The current outlook reflects the following. As Mike mentioned, November comps got off to a slow start. We believe part of this was the so-called CNN Effect something we've seen in prior cycles where customers defer shopping trips to closely follow the ins and outs of a national election. Also Thanksgiving fell in the 4th week of November this year versus the 3rd week of last year. As such customers didn't start their Thanksgiving shopping until later in the month. There are also five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. However, Christmas falls on a Wednesday this year versus Monday last year, which does help extend the selling season. All of this was factored into our plans and we feel good about our position leading into the Christmas home stretch. With that as a background for the fourth quarter, we expect net sales will be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion based on low-single-digit comp sales growth for the enterprise and both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Adjusting for stores closed as part of the portfolio optimization and the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect fourth quarter net sales for Family Dollar to decline by 10% to 12% on a year-over-year basis. We expect adjusted EPS will be in the range of $2.10 to $2.30. For the full year, we expect net sales to be in the range of 30.7 billion to $30.9 billion based on low-single-digit comp sales growth for the enterprise and both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Adjusted for stores closed as part of the portfolio optimization and the extra week in the fiscal 2023, we expect full year net sales for Family Dollar to decline by 3.5% to 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS for the full year is expected to be in the range of $5.31 to $5.51. In the interest of time, I will direct you to our supplemental financial presentation, which is available on our IR website for the remaining details to support our current outlook. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.\nRobert LaFleur: Before I go, I want to acknowledge our associates who were affected by hurricanes Helene and Milton. Those in the affected areas face significant challenges and many of them were personally and directly impacted by the storms. While rightly concerned about themselves and their families, they nonetheless stepped up to serve others. The two storms closed over 1800 of our stores, but within a day or two, two-thirds of those stores were back open and serving their communities. The resilience, dedication and commitment of our associates to their communities is inspiring. By quickly reopening these stores to provide essential services to those in need, our associates truly demonstrated what it means to live our values. Finally, I also want to take the opportunity to thank all of our associates and team leaders during this especially important holiday season. In the face of a challenging and rapidly changing landscape, I am extremely proud of the contributions made by each and every one of our associates. As a result of all your hard work, we expect to turn in a very good year-end and a very bright future lies ahead for our business. With that, we're ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now live.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. I have a two-part question on your earnings outlook moving forward. The first part is you obviously had some one-time items this year that should come back next year. So as you see today, is there anything that should stand in the way for us to simply add the impact of these one-time items to your base earnings next year? And the second part of that question is the two wildcards might be anything that happens with Family Dollar. So how should we think about that potentially impacting your earnings outlook? And then tariffs, what's the downside case to your earnings for next year in tariffs? Thank you so much.\nMichael Creedon: Thanks, Michael. I'll let Jeff handle the one-time and the FD and then I'll jump in on the tariffs. But Jeff?\nJeff Davis: Yes. Good morning, Michael. On the one-time, as we had discussed last quarter, those items would be added back to sort of a base level for going into FY'25. And then as it relates to the second part, which was around Family Dollar. As it relates to Family Dollar and a strategic review, we're not giving any guidance as to what that might, how that might impact us in 2025 at this point in time. There are a number of factors that you had mentioned, we'd have to work through, but it would be inappropriate for us to make any discussions or points of adjustment at this point in time.\nMichael Creedon: And Michael, on the tariffs, it's still unclear what will make its way to policy. But we managed through this before. Rick McNeely and his team in 2018 and 2019. They did a very good job of mitigating the vast majority of the impact with only a few levers to pull. Back then, the choices were they could change some of the specs on the product, they could negotiate furiously with our suppliers or they can eliminate the product altogether. They still have all three of those levers to pull. And yet we add to it now, we've done a tremendous amount of work over the years looking at alternative countries of origin. Our China Plus One strategy basically backs up our key categories so that we could move if we needed to. And then finally, we've got multi-price. Multi-price gives us the ability to flex where we need to if a certain product becomes something that we've got to move in the market to be competitive.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nEdward Kelly: Hi. Good morning everyone. Mike, I was hoping, can you talk a little bit more about the softness that you mentioned in November. I know you started the year, you're pretty optimistic around Q4, and I think a lot of that was around the seasonal product for holiday. So have you seen that bounce post-Thanksgiving? And I guess the question I'm really trying to get at is how much optimism is in the forecast for an improvement off of November. Can you just provide a little bit more help related to all that?\nMichael Creedon: Sure, Ed. One of the keys we're seeing is, and I mentioned it earlier, our customer is focusing on their needs and we see that in our consumables. I mean, it's an incredible, the growth we've seen in our consumables, both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And when you look at the multi-price, I mean, we ran a 6.6 in consumables on Dollar Tree multi-price. So the customer is clearly buying for need and she's also buying what we call closer to need. So we saw this in Q3 as you saw a cadence built as we got to Halloween, which occurred at the end of the quarter, you could see the strength with which she showed up in terms of buying at the end. We ran a multi-price, we ran a 10 comp for Halloween specific products. So that buying for need and then buying closer to need. And then as you look at Q4 and how it unfolds, we saw it with Thanksgiving. I mean it was -- it came at the end. I always take the foil pans, which are such a key component of Thanksgiving for us. The last week was just incredible. So we see her getting closer and closer to the need. And then what we're trying to do in terms of the balance for the rest of the quarter is really balancing that, okay, there's five fewer days, yes. But there are also, you've got more days before Christmas when you move it to the middle of the week. And so we have a wide range in the fourth quarter, but that contemplates that balance of her buying for need and then buying closer to the need and how that unfolds, especially with the five fewer days. But the set is fantastic, especially when you look at the holiday set, what we're seeing, what we're seeing in toys, what we're seeing in trimming hard, trimming gift, trimming tree. We really like the cadence we're seeing of the customer as she navigates through this holiday.\nEdward Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Boss: Great, thanks. So Mike maybe could you speak to customer demand trends across income cohorts best you can decipher out. Any notable trends you're seeing between consumables and discretionary? And just for perspective, were comps at the Dollar Tree banner positive in November? And then, Jeff, on the conversions, I guess, is there a way to elaborate maybe on top line and margin performance versus your initial plan? And just a mindset for further slowing the rollout this year and what the expansion looks like for next year?\nMichael Creedon: Yes, I'll take the first part and Jeff to take the margin. When you look at the customer cohort, our low-end customer is definitely pressured. We see that. We see that she is clearly focused on consumables. We see a rise in the eat at home, which helps us, and you see that in our consumables comp. And then the low -- the middle income and even the higher income is still feeling some pressure. And basically, when you look at a year ago, they were cutting out big purchases. TV, things like that. If you look at the early part of this year, they started eating more at home and cutting going out. Now they're reducing some parties, and we see that or the party is not as big, they don't invite as many people as they did. So we're seeing that throughout. But I think when you look at the share we're taking and you look at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar as an answer for this customer as they're pursuing need and closer to need, we like what we're seeing from that customer. The shift is tough. It is really tough to start the year when you have Thanksgiving later and all those days are comping against days from last year that are different in the calendar. Look, it happens every six years. It's one of the things that we have to deal with. And it definitely is a reason for the soft start. But when we double-click and we look into fall in Thanksgiving sell-through. When we double-click on some of the early subcategories for Christmas. We believe that we're set up really well for the fourth quarter and our guidance implies that we'll hit that low-single-digit in both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.\nJeff Davis: Matt, as it relates to the conversions, we've talked about this in prior quarters. But if you think about our stores as being a little bit of a bell curve, we've got the stores that are far exceeding our expectation with respect to multi-price across not only consumables, but discretionary and some of those that are laggards. But as we think about on the quantum of the business, it is absolutely meeting our expectation. What we're really excited about and Mike has been talking about it is as we've been transitioning now into the time of the year where discretionary is a much more important complex for our customer purchases. We're actually seeing a customer really lean into our multi-price and that's something else that's very attractive to us. The merchant teams have done an extraordinary job of going out and sourcing and determining how to bring good value to our customers. From a margin perspective, in the third quarter, we actually saw the impact of multiprice being more muted than what we thought it would be, meaning that the margins came in stronger for us. And a lot of that is, once again, that mix and the discretionary versus the consumables is what we're seeing.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nErica Eiler: Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our question. So I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into Family Dollar. So traffic picked up. You talked a lot about the positive inflection discretionary. So can you talk about your confidence in being able to sustain the momentum on both these fronts?\nMichael Creedon: Sure. Yes, it was a really nice quarter at Family Dollar. And one of the things I mentioned in my remarks earlier is that we feel that, yes, you've got some of the SNAP that you're sunsetting over time, but it's still an impact. We feel the actions we took and the team took to really improve the discretionary, move a little bit on the discretionary side to the, if you will, the consumable side of discretionary. The things that people will buy more often and buy each year or each quarter within the discretionary. We feel that, that's set and the resets that we've done to the stores, targeted end-caps that really provide the customer with what they need. We believe those are long lived. We believe that the actions we're taking today help us as we go through. And then the changes to the stores, when you, over 1,500 renovations now. Our 2.5s, which is our latest and greatest format. I mean the comps are fantastic and really fueling it. And then the XSBs which is this urban smaller footprint store is resonating incredibly well with the customer. Those changes are long lasting. Those are the ones that really help us.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Zhihan Ma from Bernstein. Your line is now live.\nZhihan Ma: Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the multi-price side of things. I think last quarter, you mentioned more mid-single-digit comp lift for the Q1 and Q2 conversions. Can you talk about the cadence of the multi-price rollout, how the Q3 conversions compared to the Q1 and Q2? Has there been some sort of a deceleration given that we're seeing a more low-single-digit comp sales lift this quarter? Thank you.\nMichael Creedon: Sure. First of all, the customer response has been incredibly positive to multi-price. If you look the basket has five more units in it. It's nearly double the value of a traditional Dollar Tree basket and we're seeing more trips from the customer in terms of our typical customer, which means they're really embracing that treasure hunt of what they'll find on the next visit via multi-price. In terms of the cadence, not all conversions are created equal. When you're going, if you look at Q1, the vast majority of those stores were going from what we call a 1.0. So just $1.25, they don't have Dollar Tree Plus, they don't have the three, four, five coolers. And so they're going from a 1.0 all the way to a 3.0. And we look at Q2 that was kind of balanced across the two cohorts going from a 1.0 to a 3.0 versus a 2.0 to 3.0. When I look at the Q3, and this is where the decal comes in, we were 75% coming from 2.0 to 3.0. And as we look out, we have to convert them by distribution center. And so when you pick a distribution center that's heavily geographically weighted on Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, you also tend to hit maybe some of our harder geographies and you hit stores that already have Dollar Tree Plus. So what we've done is we look out over next year as we're really trying to balance that out. So that we keep a perspective of that 1.0 to 3.0 and 2.0 to 3.0 in terms of the balance. One of the things I'm most encouraged by, though, is as multi-price unfolds, the stores from Q1 continue to be our strongest. Q2, second strongest, and then Q3. So the longer they're on multi-price, the more the customer finds it and the more the customer shops it and the better the experience is. And then finally one of the -- when you look at some of the geographies of going from 1.0 to 3.0 as we did in Q1, they got the very best of the learnings of Dollar Tree Plus from the last couple of years. And so as we go back we now take those Dollar Tree Plus learnings and we revisit other Dollar Tree Plus stores and we're upgrading. We're taking some categories out or some SKUs out and we're adding in ones that resonate better. Categories that were a bigger hit or SKUs that really resonated with our customer and help them. So this is -- we're nine months into this. This is still test and learn, but we like what we're learning and we love what the customer is experiencing and the feedback that they're giving us.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\nJohn Heinbockel: Hey, Mike, a couple of things, you didn't talk about the performance of the non-3.0, right? So I think they comped about one, which is a little bit better than last quarter. And that gap versus the 3.0, right, is the -- which maybe like 200 plus bps. Is that -- is the gap -- if you segregate it, is it entirely multi-price point items that are driving that gap and then the last thing, right, it's working as well as it is. How can you accelerate the process, right, of without letting execution slip, right? Because you'd like to get chain-wide done here probably in the next 18 months, no.\nMichael Creedon: Yes. So, John, it's -- first in terms of the non- 3.0 performance. It's not just about the base stores. We'll get to those, we'll convert them. I think one of the keys in accelerating the non-3.0 is in what we're doing going back to Dollar Tree Plus, which has been in place for several years now and refreshing that. We take whole sections and refresh them and really like the results that we're seeing. In terms of the \u2013 and, yes, we did see one of the -- we always measure our gap in terms of how are multi-price comparing to the chain. And one of the reasons that gap closed is the chain got better. Dollar Tree Plus, definitely, those base stores got closer to multi-price, which is encouraging. And then there's two ways to accelerate, the first is in the conversions themselves. And you'll see we slowed that conversion. Part of that is just from an execution standpoint. We introduced some milestones where we said our district manager has to sign off in a store four weeks before we go live and then a regional director, our next level up, has to sign off on a store two weeks before. And they have the power to say, no, yes. They have the power to say we need some support to make sure we're ready or change or whatever reason they might have. And so it does slow us, but we believe that done right is better than done fast there. And that's not our only means of accelerating. We also have the opportunity to go back in and look at the SKUs that are working for us. We're several years into Dollar Tree Plus. We're only nine months into multi-price 3.0. Going back and looking at what resonated with the customer and how do we change going forward? How do we change a season? How do we change in every day. And then finally and this kind of goes to the rollout cadence. Yes, we leverage third-party. You see that in our SG&A, but there's also an org capacity that we're managing through. And one of the reasons we slowed in Q3 is we had all those $0.99 onlys that opened in Q3. That taps on a lot of the same resources in terms of our store setup crews, the leadership that goes out and works these stores. And so we shifted rightly. We wanted to get those $0.99 only stores converted as quickly as we could so that we didn't let a customer forget about us. If we can flip those in 30 days or 60 days, that's far better than 90 days or 120 days. The longer you're close, the more likelihood is the customer will change their habit. We put a ton of focus on getting those stores open. As you saw, we have almost all of them now open and converted and now we can kind of put some resources back towards that multi-price rollout in '25.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, good morning, everyone. Mike, I have a follow-up on multi-price. The 5.1 that we talked about the prior quarter versus the 3.3. Are you saying those are apples-to-apples or not necessarily given timing of 1.0s and 3.0s. If it is apples-to-apples, is it because some of the old 1.0s that got converted are seeing inherent or slowing or is it that the new 3.0s are not as impactful as they were when they were initially rolled out?\nMichael Creedon: Yes. So the 5.1 was just how did the Q1 conversions perform in Q2. That's what that was. And as I roll that out to Q3, Simeon, those Q1 conversions continue to be the strongest performing then Q2 and then Q3 in that order. So the longer they're on, the better they perform. And going from a 1.0 to a 3.0 to use our parlance, $1.25 is a 1.0, $1.3 plus is a 2.0, multi-price in-line is a 3.0. The stores that went from 1.0 to 3.0 have the biggest bang. We see them because they're getting everything, if you will. And so then we go back to stores that just have Dollar Tree Plus and we take the learnings of what's working what's resonating the most and we go upgrade those stores. And physically the cost we have for resetting the store, we get that once. Yes, it plays out because of the conversions over 18 months or two years. But we don't have to go back and change hardware in that store. We don't have to add steel. We do that once. And then Rick and his team can go and make sure we have the best assortment that's resonating the most with the customer. And so as you look at that cadence, yes, our Q3 were the softest. They had the fewest amount of 1.0 all the way to 3.0. And I also think there's some geography mix in there. If you look, I mentioned in the Q2 call, we saw California really resonate well with multi-price. Florida, we expect to resonate well. We did have some execution issues. I was really pleased to see them kind of have a stronger Q2. And now as we look at the Q3 sets, we're more in our kind of Midwest area and it doesn't have the same pop that we saw in California and now in Florida.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nKate McShane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Mike, just given your new position, I wondered if you could talk to anything that you might want to accelerate or change with the investments or the strategy and can you talk about some of the leadership changes you announced recently for Chief of Dollar Tree stores and President of Family Dollar stores?\nMichael Creedon: Sure. Yes, I've been here more than two years now. My family and I absolutely love the area. It is a great community to be a part of. I've gotten to know the founders here of Dollar Tree, gotten to know a lot of people, our kids go to school together, those types of things. So I'm really embraced this company, this culture and its future. And so that has been just amazing and very humbling. So I'm excited about that. In terms of the changes, our focus is on the successful execution of the Family Dollar strategic review and setting up Dollar Tree for a multiyear kind of next chapter if you will. That's my focus. That's what the Board's charged me with. And when we look at the pluses and minuses of that, we're going to continue to test and learn. We're going to continue to make enhancements to the business and what resonates the most with our customer. And we're always going to start with our customer and work our way back that doesn't change. So multi-price is a perfect example of that. It's amazing what resonates and what doesn't. And we'll continue to kind of work that to make sure we're relevant for the customer. But it's exciting what we see. The increased trips, the bigger basket really like to see how the customer is responding to it. And then in terms of the leadership changes both Jocy Konrad and Jason Nordin have been here a year now, have both had a big impact on store standards, big impact with our associates. And it's just as I looked at the next chapter, as I look at the next five years for Family Dollar, the next five years for Dollar Tree, I wanted to make sure we had the folks that were best suited to that role. So Jason's prior role at Pilot Flying J fits really well with Family Dollar, the convenience element of it. The high consumables element of it. Jocy Konrad is the first to say. She's one of our biggest customer. She's a crafter. She resonates incredibly well with the team. And so I think these changes position us really well for that next chapter of Family Dollar post review and Dollar Tree go forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now live.\nRyan Bulger: Hey, guys. This is Ryan Bulger on for Chuck here. I just wanted to ask on -- it didn't come up this quarter, but there's been the general liability claims a couple of times in the past. Is that something that you'd expect to see going forward in FY'25? And just sort of how that may progress going forward? Thank you.\nMichael Creedon: Jeff, I'll let you handle that.\nJeff Davis: Yes. Maybe that's a little bit of a sore spot for us here because we've spoken about it so many different times. Hey, listen, we believe that the adjustments that we've taken this year addresses the portfolio of claims and the progression of those claims. We do an evaluation twice a year, once in April and then a second time in October timeframe. We believe we're well positioned based upon the adjustments that we've taken. As we move forward into the future years, it all depends on number of claims and the severity of claims. And what we're doing from a safety and security basis with our stores, how we're helping train our associates how to deal with different situations should help mitigate some of the challenges that we've had in the past. But at this point, it would be, I think, inappropriate for me to start talking about 2025. But as we think about what the claims that we have on the books today and how they've progressed that the reserves that we've taken adequately reflect what that liability would be.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nKrisztina Katai: Hi. Good morning, Mike and Jeff. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask on margin. Obviously -- we saw nice gross margin improvement, but SG&A saw deleverage and you cited higher depreciation on some of the temporary labor associated with the 3.0 rollout. So maybe can you quantify the impact of these two? And when do you expect these temporary labor costs to normalize? And what is the long-term SG&A leverage opportunity as the 3.0 rollout matures? Thank you.\nMichael Creedon: Jeff, why don't you take the first one.\nJeff Davis: Yes. So there's a couple of elements to this. If we think about, first of all, from a temporary labor perspective, the temporary labor is associated with the multi-price rollout this year being the first year and then over the next 18 to 24 months, we'll complete that. So you would expect that, that would be a headwind on a declining basis over the next 18 months to 24 months. As it relates to the depreciation, the depreciation reflects the quantum of the investments that we've been making over the last couple of years as it relates to new store growth, the investments we've been making in the supply chain and of course, in our IT system cost. If you take a look at our asset investments, they're actually starting to moderate. Last year, it was about $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion previous to that was $1.2 billion. This year, we believe we'll be roughly about $1.8 billion. And as we now kind of hit sort of a high point and as that will moderate as we go forward, the expectation is that the depreciation, the increase in the depreciation on a period-over-period basis should start to moderate. Unfortunately, where we are in this cycle, given the customer purchasing behaviors with respect to consumables versus discretionary, some of the headwinds that we've had more recently as it relates to shrink and how and mix, how that's been playing out. I've mentioned before that in this economic cycle that we needed approximately a low-single-digit, maybe a low-single-digit plus comp in order to leverage the business. And coming in at just shy of 2% this quarter on the Dollar Tree side, you saw that there was some deleverage as it relates to the SG&A. Our expectation is that we will continue to be disciplined in our investments, we discipline in our spend. We'll increase productivity where we can, such that as those sales start to come in at the higher margin rates that we'll be able to flow more of that to the bottom line.\nMichael Creedon: Yes. The only thing I'd add is these investments that drive the depreciation, the investments we've had to do, the investments we want to do, the cost comes right away, the benefit, the returns come over time. I think new store openings, I'm incredibly excited about the pace with which we're opening new stores now compared to in the past. And the real benefit of new stores comes in that year two, year three, year four before they reach kind of the maturity of the enterprise, both in sales and in their profitability. And so you get that over time, that benefit. And that's a great example of you hit the cost now, the depreciation over time, but the real benefit in the accelerating benefit is a little delayed. Then the second thing I'll just say on the leverage is and I've been in small box for a while, small box math is a beautiful thing. The more sales you can drive through that box, the better you're going to leverage because you get to a point where you need so many people to open the store and close the store, but you can increase the sales and not have to increase the ton of the payroll and that's really where the leverage comes. So our focus is on retail fundamentals that will drive those sales per box.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Seth Sigman from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nSeth Sigman: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on the margins. I think you've raised the benefit from lower freight costs by about $1 to $1 for the year. It seems like that's more than the total guidance change. So I'm curious if you could maybe frame for us what the offsets to that are in the guidance at this point? And then specifically on the gross margin in terms of the acceleration that you've built in here into the fourth quarter? And maybe just remind us of some of the key drivers for that. Thanks so much.\nMichael Creedon: Jeff?\nJeff Davis: Yes, I'll take the first part. Yes, we did increase the expectation of the freight benefit, as you had mentioned, by approximately a dime on the top end. There are certain offsets that we would have had during the course of the -- and really that dime is for the second half of the year. It's not just for the fourth quarter. We didn't quantify because there was a number of puts and takes. But if you can imagine when Mike was, in his prepared remarks, speaking to the storms that we had, there were certain costs that we incurred associated with that. It was $0.02 to $0.03 associated with markdowns and other costs to return the stores back to their normal operating format. There are a couple of other expenses associated with some of the balance sheet accruals that we've taken most importantly. We have been running short of what our overall annual plan was going to be with respect to sales. And we take a look at our inventories. We want to make sure that we're taking the right markdowns on them to address those liabilities. We did so during the course of the quarter, such we make sure that, that is appropriately reflected. So that starts to offset a portion of the additional freight costs. But all-in-all, as we think about the balance of the year and what the opportunities are across the business, the guidance that we've given reflects all those puts and takes.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nMichael Creedon: Thank you for your time today. Look forward to wishing everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Jeff Davis",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike and good morning. Before I discuss the details of our third quarter results, I want to extend my thanks to our Interim CEO, Mike Creedon; our former Chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling, my finance team and the extended Dollar Tree management team. During my time here I've had the privilege of working with talented colleagues, navigating exciting challenges and celebrating many milestones along the way. I'm proud of what we've accomplished together and I'm confident in this management team and the business strategies that are in place. I remain energized about the future possibilities for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. With that, let's get back to business. As usual, I'll start with a discussion of our quarterly results, and then I'll provide our outlook for the balance of 2024. Where applicable, I will focus on our adjusted results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in our earnings release. Third quarter adjusted EPS increased 16% to $1.12. Overall results benefited from sequential top line improvement at both banners and positive discretionary trends at Family Dollar. Turning to the business results, on a consolidated basis, adjusted operating income was $343 million, a 14% increase from last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by approximately 40 basis points to 4.5%, reflecting a 120 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 80 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.8% compared to 21.8%, reflecting lower workers opportunity tax credits in the current year. Adjusted net income increased 13% to $241 million. Now let's move to our business segment results. At Dollar Tree, adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $466 million. Adjusted operating margin decreased 140 basis points, driven by a 60 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 180 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin improved primarily from lower freight costs, partially offset by markdowns and higher distribution costs. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher depreciation and temporary labor for the 3.0 rollout. At Family Dollar adjusted operating income was $10 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $66 million last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 220 basis points on a 130 basis point increase in gross margin and a 90 basis point decrease in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin increased primarily from lower freight costs, lower markdowns from the OTC recall last year and lower shrink. Adjusted SG&A rate decreased primarily from lower payroll and lower store supplies. Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Total inventory was $5.5 billion flat to last year. With cash and cash equivalents of $698 million and senior notes of $3.4 billion our balance sheet remains strong. Our bank defined leverage at quarter-end stood at approximately 2.4 times. On the cash flow statement, we generated $786 million from operating activities compared to $506 million last year. Capital expenditures were $426 million versus $541 million last year. Our free cash flow improved by $395 million over last year. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our revolver and no commercial paper outstanding. Year-to-date, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock for approximately $404 million which is consistent with our year-to-date free cash flow generation of $389 million. At quarter-end, we had approximately $952 million remaining under our existing share repurchase program. Now let me provide some perspective on our fourth quarter and full year expectations. The current outlook reflects the following. As Mike mentioned, November comps got off to a slow start. We believe part of this was the so-called CNN Effect something we've seen in prior cycles where customers defer shopping trips to closely follow the ins and outs of a national election. Also Thanksgiving fell in the 4th week of November this year versus the 3rd week of last year. As such customers didn't start their Thanksgiving shopping until later in the month. There are also five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. However, Christmas falls on a Wednesday this year versus Monday last year, which does help extend the selling season. All of this was factored into our plans and we feel good about our position leading into the Christmas home stretch. With that as a background for the fourth quarter, we expect net sales will be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion based on low-single-digit comp sales growth for the enterprise and both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Adjusting for stores closed as part of the portfolio optimization and the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect fourth quarter net sales for Family Dollar to decline by 10% to 12% on a year-over-year basis. We expect adjusted EPS will be in the range of $2.10 to $2.30. For the full year, we expect net sales to be in the range of 30.7 billion to $30.9 billion based on low-single-digit comp sales growth for the enterprise and both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Adjusted for stores closed as part of the portfolio optimization and the extra week in the fiscal 2023, we expect full year net sales for Family Dollar to decline by 3.5% to 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS for the full year is expected to be in the range of $5.31 to $5.51. In the interest of time, I will direct you to our supplemental financial presentation, which is available on our IR website for the remaining details to support our current outlook. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Yes. Good morning, Michael. On the one-time, as we had discussed last quarter, those items would be added back to sort of a base level for going into FY'25. And then as it relates to the second part, which was around Family Dollar. As it relates to Family Dollar and a strategic review, we're not giving any guidance as to what that might, how that might impact us in 2025 at this point in time. There are a number of factors that you had mentioned, we'd have to work through, but it would be inappropriate for us to make any discussions or points of adjustment at this point in time. Matt, as it relates to the conversions, we've talked about this in prior quarters. But if you think about our stores as being a little bit of a bell curve, we've got the stores that are far exceeding our expectation with respect to multi-price across not only consumables, but discretionary and some of those that are laggards. But as we think about on the quantum of the business, it is absolutely meeting our expectation. What we're really excited about and Mike has been talking about it is as we've been transitioning now into the time of the year where discretionary is a much more important complex for our customer purchases. We're actually seeing a customer really lean into our multi-price and that's something else that's very attractive to us. The merchant teams have done an extraordinary job of going out and sourcing and determining how to bring good value to our customers. From a margin perspective, in the third quarter, we actually saw the impact of multiprice being more muted than what we thought it would be, meaning that the margins came in stronger for us. And a lot of that is, once again, that mix and the discretionary versus the consumables is what we're seeing. Yes. Maybe that's a little bit of a sore spot for us here because we've spoken about it so many different times. Hey, listen, we believe that the adjustments that we've taken this year addresses the portfolio of claims and the progression of those claims. We do an evaluation twice a year, once in April and then a second time in October timeframe. We believe we're well positioned based upon the adjustments that we've taken. As we move forward into the future years, it all depends on number of claims and the severity of claims. And what we're doing from a safety and security basis with our stores, how we're helping train our associates how to deal with different situations should help mitigate some of the challenges that we've had in the past. But at this point, it would be, I think, inappropriate for me to start talking about 2025. But as we think about what the claims that we have on the books today and how they've progressed that the reserves that we've taken adequately reflect what that liability would be. Yes. So there's a couple of elements to this. If we think about, first of all, from a temporary labor perspective, the temporary labor is associated with the multi-price rollout this year being the first year and then over the next 18 to 24 months, we'll complete that. So you would expect that, that would be a headwind on a declining basis over the next 18 months to 24 months. As it relates to the depreciation, the depreciation reflects the quantum of the investments that we've been making over the last couple of years as it relates to new store growth, the investments we've been making in the supply chain and of course, in our IT system cost. If you take a look at our asset investments, they're actually starting to moderate. Last year, it was about $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion previous to that was $1.2 billion. This year, we believe we'll be roughly about $1.8 billion. And as we now kind of hit sort of a high point and as that will moderate as we go forward, the expectation is that the depreciation, the increase in the depreciation on a period-over-period basis should start to moderate. Unfortunately, where we are in this cycle, given the customer purchasing behaviors with respect to consumables versus discretionary, some of the headwinds that we've had more recently as it relates to shrink and how and mix, how that's been playing out. I've mentioned before that in this economic cycle that we needed approximately a low-single-digit, maybe a low-single-digit plus comp in order to leverage the business. And coming in at just shy of 2% this quarter on the Dollar Tree side, you saw that there was some deleverage as it relates to the SG&A. Our expectation is that we will continue to be disciplined in our investments, we discipline in our spend. We'll increase productivity where we can, such that as those sales start to come in at the higher margin rates that we'll be able to flow more of that to the bottom line. Yes, I'll take the first part. Yes, we did increase the expectation of the freight benefit, as you had mentioned, by approximately a dime on the top end. There are certain offsets that we would have had during the course of the -- and really that dime is for the second half of the year. It's not just for the fourth quarter. We didn't quantify because there was a number of puts and takes. But if you can imagine when Mike was, in his prepared remarks, speaking to the storms that we had, there were certain costs that we incurred associated with that. It was $0.02 to $0.03 associated with markdowns and other costs to return the stores back to their normal operating format.

We want to make sure that we're taking the right markdowns on them to address those liabilities. We did so during the course of the quarter, such we make sure that, that is appropriately reflected. So that starts to offset a portion of the additional freight costs. But all-in-all, as we think about the balance of the year and what the opportunities are across the business, the guidance that we've given reflects all those puts and takes."

            "name": "Michael Creedon",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to today's call. This is my first time speaking to you as Interim CEO, following our recent leadership transition. I'm honored that the Board has named me to this role at a critical time in our transformation. To all our stakeholders, please know that I take this responsibility very seriously and with great humility. I also want to thank Rick Dreiling for his leadership and the support he provided to all our associates and leaders. From all of us at Dollar Tree, we wish him the very best. As an organization, our top priorities remain accelerating the growth of Dollar Tree and finalizing the strategic review to identify the optimal ownership structure for Family Dollar. Executing against these objectives is the first priority for this leadership team and our Board. Throughout the strategic review process, we have maintained our operational focus and driven meaningful improvements in Family Dollar sales productivity and profitability. Our ultimate goal remains positioning both banners for long-term success and unlocking value for Dollar Tree shareholders. At the Dollar Tree banner, we're converting stores to our in-line multi-price 3.0 format, opening new stores and improving the in-store experience through renovations and customer service enhancements. We believe there is ample runway ahead for Dollar Tree to meaningfully grow its square footage over a multiyear horizon. Value always resonates with the customer and that is why our business model has stood the test of time across decades and multiple economic cycles. We have made good progress on store conditions and operations, but there is more work to be done. At the end of the day, retail fundamentals are the key to unlocking value at Dollar Tree and I'm confident that we have the right team in place to deliver improved merchandising execution and store standards. One of the things that originally attracted me to Dollar Tree was its culture and clear understanding of what we do and who we serve. We offer unparalleled value and convenience for our customers and our scale provides us with a unique competitive advantage through our procurement power and distribution reach. We empower our associates and support their career aspirations or as we like to say, this is a career not a job. And it is my responsibility to ensure that every aspect of our culture supports this goal. From the many stores in DCs that I've visited in my two plus years at Dollar Tree and from the time I've spent here at home in the store support center, it is clear to me that our leadership team and dedicated associates are aligned and our objectives are in focus, position Dollar Tree for sustainable growth and create value for our fellow shareholders. While I've already talked to many of you in the investment community, I look forward to getting to know many more of you in the days and months ahead. With that, I'd like to share our third quarter highlights and update you on several of our key initiatives. As a reminder, we said that third quarter results were in line with expectations when we announced our leadership transition in early November. In Q3, our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar merchandising efforts produced tangible results and sales came in at the high end of our outlook range. Total net sales got a big boost from our non-comp stores with Dollar Tree non-comp sales contributing over three times more revenue this year. This reflects the increased pace of Dollar Tree store openings overall and the especially strong out-of-the-gate performance of the $0.99 only portfolio. Dollar Tree's comp improved sequentially over Q2 driven by market share gains and positive trends in both traffic and ticket. Family Dollar's comp also improved sequentially with its first positive discretionary comp since 2022. Turning to the current environment and tone of business, customers continue to seek value and many are focused on buying for need and buying closer to the time of that need. We continue to see evidence of belt-tightening, particularly among lower income customers and to a lesser extent among middle and higher income families with young children. While this dynamic remains a discretionary headwind, it does create some opportunities across both banners in consumables as consumption data shows lower and middle income households are increasingly shifting more of their spending toward food at home. Given these trends, it's worth reminding everyone of the strong value proposition we offer at Dollar Tree. A customer that walks in to a typical Dollar Tree store will find over 90% of the products in the store priced at a $1.25. So we offer a powerful solution for customers looking to stretch their dollar. Moving onto Dollar Tree's multi-price rollout, we converted another 720 stores to the 3.0 format in the quarter, bringing the total number of converted stores to approximately 2,300. The converted stores produced approximately 30% of Dollar Tree's total net sales in Q3 and continue to produce comps nicely above our portfolio average. The multi-price 3.0 stores in aggregate produced a 3.3 comp in the quarter with a strong 6.6 consumables comp and a modestly positive discretionary comp. Importantly, comps at these stores are being driven by traffic and ticket in roughly equal proportion. Focusing in on some Q3 category highlights at our 3.0 stores, we saw seven comp across our full seasonal assortment, including a 10 comp for Halloween specific products. Looking out to the balance of the year, we expect to convert an additional 300 to 400 stores to the 3.0 format by the end of Q4. This will put us a bit below the 2,800 figure we provided last quarter, but we are taking our time to ensure that each store is ready for conversion before we give it the final green light. To reiterate what I said last quarter, it's better to get the conversion done right than to get them done fast. That being said, including converted and newly opened stores, we will have approximately 3,000 multi-price 3.0 stores open and operating by year-end, including most of the former $0.99 only stores. And speaking of the former $0.99 only stores, we are just about done with the integration of this portfolio. To-date, we've converted and reopened 158 stores as Dollar Tree's and should finish up the remaining handful of stores by the end of this month. The strong initial sales performance of these stores confirms our original optimism about the quality of these assets and their locations across California and the Southwest. Stepping back and looking at our real estate efforts more broadly, we are well on our way towards meeting our full year goal of opening 600 to 650 new stores. Through the end of Q3, we've opened 567 new stores with over 85% of those coming under the Dollar Tree banner. Year-over-year, we have increased our Dollar Tree store base by over 7% and still see a long growth runway ahead of us given the growing market resonance of multi-price. In supply chain, our team continues to do outstanding work in the face of challenges related to our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma that was destroyed by a tornado. The biggest challenge is elevated stem miles across our network. On top of that absorbing a 158 new $0.99 only stores within a relatively concentrated geography required additional resource allocation. While our newly reopened DC and West Memphis has helped to relieve some of the network pressure, additional measures are needed to restore the network to peak efficiency. To this end, we are working to add new capacity to our network, including replacing the capacity we lost in Marietta. Unload times continue to improve at the stores using rotacarts out of our DCs in West Memphis, Matthews, North Carolina and here in Chesapeake. In Q3, our proactive steps to reduce shrink delivered year-over-year improvements at both banners, particularly Family Dollar. While the expansion of multi-price at Dollar Tree has necessitated some stepped up shrink mitigation efforts, we still saw modest reduction in shrink during the quarter. Now, let me recap some of the operational highlights from the quarter. On a consolidated basis, net sales increased 3.5% to $7.6 billion and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.12. Looking at performance by banner, Dollar Tree segment comp increased 1.8% on a 1.5% increase in traffic and a 0.3% increase in average ticket. This was Dollar Tree's first positive ticket comp since Q4 of 2022. Dollar Tree's Q3 consumable mix was 49.9%, a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points. Mix had been shifting towards consumables by over 200 basis points in each of the previous four quarters. So this is clearly a step in the right direction. Consumable comp was 6.2%, which came on top of an 11.1% comp. Snacks, beverages and candy were the best performing categories. Discretionary comp declined 1.8%, reflecting consumers ongoing focus on needs based purchases. Discretionary comp was modestly positive at the multi-price 3.0 stores in the quarter. Hardware, electronics, healthcare and personal care were our best performing discretionary categories, with additional strength seen in Halloween and textiles at the 3.0 stores. Our soft discretionary demand was consistent with trends we saw across the broader retail industry during the quarter. Based on Nielsen data, Dollar Tree's consumables market share gain accelerated in the quarter, with growth in dollar volume outpacing the industry by 480 basis points and unit volume outpacing by 280 basis points. Before moving onto Family Dollar, let me take a moment to comment on Dollar Tree's recent performance in the context of broader market trends. Given Dollar Tree's particular consumer product and price point mix, its comps are running below our long-term run rate expectations. We attribute this to the unique challenges our customers are facing at this point in the economic cycle, which might not necessarily be aligned with the cycle timing at other retailers. Whether looking at comps or store growth, we believe our multi-year results stack up well against any retailer in the country. With a two-year comp stack of 17%, our consumable business is as strong as ever, but that is only half of Dollar Tree's business. The other half is discretionary. And these are the categories where shoppers have pulled back the most given the cumulative impact of the economic pressures they feel. Moving onto the Family Dollar segment, comp increased 1.9% with the gain driven almost entirely by traffic. Average ticket was flat after three consecutive quarters of declines. Consumables comp increased 1.3%, which came on top of a 6.2% comp increase last year. Discretionary comp increased 3.7%, which was a 540 basis points sequential improvement over Q2. More importantly, Q3 was Family Dollar's first positive discretionary comp since Q4, 2022. Children's apparel, electronics and hardware were the best performing discretionary categories. We believe Family Dollar's positive discretionary results are the direct result of our targeted merchandising efforts. In recent quarters, we adjusted our pricing strategy with more emphasis on value and higher frequency purchase items like everyday home essentials. As part of this strategy, we increased the number of items priced at or below $5. We updated our in-store signage and shelf strips to better communicate our price value image. And we identified additional ways to optimize our planograms to drive sales and space productivity. These initiatives are clearly resonating with our core Family Dollar customer and we are seeing the positive results at the cash register. We are also pleased to report that Family Dollar's renovation and store conversion program is generating positive results. Since the beginning of the program in 2022, we have completed over 1500 projects and year-to-date comps are up by high-single-digits at our H2.5 format stores and by double-digits at our urban extra small box format stores. As a reminder, these formats feature customized product assortments that better meet the needs of our diverse customer base. For example, H2.5 stores include additional coolers, expanded seasonal offerings and an enhanced shopping experience with customized end-caps and space optimization that drive better unit economics. Lastly, on Family Dollar, we estimate reduced SNAP benefits were 30 basis point comp headwind in the quarter. While overall SNAP payments were down by 5% nationally in Q3, we think the comp headwinds from SNAP will continue to moderate over the balance of the year. Shifting gears, we have received questions about the potential impact of tariffs in the new administration. While the situation remains fluid and the exact nature, scope and eventual timing of any new tariffs is not yet clear, we are prepared to act on multiple fronts. Rick McNeely and his team of merchants have many years of experience successfully navigating a variety of tariff landscapes. Back in 2018 and 2019, when we last dealt with this issue, we were able to mitigate the majority of the potential impact by negotiating lower costs with our suppliers, changing product specs or pack sizes or dropping non-economical items. Today, all three of those options are still at our disposal. On top of those, we now have detailed plans in place to shift supply sources for most of our products to alternate countries and multi-price gives us additional flexibility on our product assortment. Based on our scale and our past history of navigating through similar challenges, we believe there is a wide range of potential actions that we can take to help mitigate additional tariffs if and when they materialize. With respect to freight, markets continue to be relatively stable, particularly in relation to domestic freight. On ocean freight, we continue to manage through a fluid environment despite disruptions over the past year in the Red Sea and Panama Canal, as well as the strikes at North American ports. Regarding potential strikes, we are proactively managing our seasonal imports in the event that the East and Gulf Coast ports workers don't approve their tentative contract by the current January deadline. I also want to comment briefly on the proposed Department of Labor overtime rule. Last month, a US District Court in Texas struck down the proposed rule in a decision that applied nationwide. The court invalidated both phases of the threshold increase, the one from this past July and the pending one for next month. We absorb the first increase back in July and won't reverse that change. It remains to be seen whether the current administration will appeal the ruling in its waning days or if the incoming administration will revisit the issue, but we are prepared for various scenarios. We remain committed to completing the formal review of strategic alternatives for Family Dollar, which could include a potential sale, spinoff or other disposition of the business among others. The process is moving forward as planned. While good progress is being made by the team, there remains no set deadline or definitive timeline for completion and at this time we can't comment on any specific outcome. We will continue to share updates when we have new public information. The guideposts of the review remain as always to maximize shareholder value through finding the optimal structure for each banner. We have made solid operational progress at Family Dollar over the past few years, even as our core customer was navigating their way through an extremely challenging macro landscape. We're proud of the work we've accomplished to-date and we look forward to the next steps in the review and for the business. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to offer a few high level comments about the current tone of business and our outlook for the balance of the year. Jeff will cover this in greater detail in his remarks. Our merchandising teams have laid the foundation for a successful year-end holiday season. We're especially excited by our expanded Christmas assortment at Dollar Tree and our ability to deliver exceptional value to consumers at a wider range of price points. While the response to our expanding multi-price assortment continues to be positive, the fourth quarter got off to a softer start given the election and later than usual Thanksgiving timing. That said, we remain optimistic about December. While there are five fewer selling days in total between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, we should get some extra help from Christmas falling in the middle of the week. Our merchant and operation teams have done an excellent job preparing for the holidays. The stores look great and our merchandise assortment is more compelling than it's ever been. Even with these moving pieces, we are confident in our ability to deliver low-single-digit comps in the fourth quarter at both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners. Before I wrap up, I am sure you saw our announcement earlier this morning that Jeff Davis will be stepping down as Chief Financial Officer. The company has launched an external search and to facilitate a smooth transition, Jeff has agreed to remain on board through the filing of our 10-K. Ideally, we plan to announce a successor prior to his departure. We thank Jeff for his service and appreciate the contributions he has made to the business during his time with Dollar Tree. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Thanks, Michael. I'll let Jeff handle the one-time and the FD and then I'll jump in on the tariffs. But Jeff? And Michael, on the tariffs, it's still unclear what will make its way to policy. But we managed through this before. Rick McNeely and his team in 2018 and 2019. They did a very good job of mitigating the vast majority of the impact with only a few levers to pull. Back then, the choices were they could change some of the specs on the product, they could negotiate furiously with our suppliers or they can eliminate the product altogether. They still have all three of those levers to pull. And yet we add to it now, we've done a tremendous amount of work over the years looking at alternative countries of origin. Our China Plus One strategy basically backs up our key categories so that we could move if we needed to. And then finally, we've got multi-price. Multi-price gives us the ability to flex where we need to if a certain product becomes something that we've got to move in the market to be competitive. Sure, Ed. One of the keys we're seeing is, and I mentioned it earlier, our customer is focusing on their needs and we see that in our consumables. I mean, it's an incredible, the growth we've seen in our consumables, both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And when you look at the multi-price, I mean, we ran a 6.6 in consumables on Dollar Tree multi-price. So the customer is clearly buying for need and she's also buying what we call closer to need. So we saw this in Q3 as you saw a cadence built as we got to Halloween, which occurred at the end of the quarter, you could see the strength with which she showed up in terms of buying at the end. We ran a multi-price, we ran a 10 comp for Halloween specific products. So that buying for need and then buying closer to need. And then as you look at Q4 and how it unfolds, we saw it with Thanksgiving. I mean it was -- it came at the end. I always take the foil pans, which are such a key component of Thanksgiving for us. The last week was just incredible. So we see her getting closer and closer to the need. And then what we're trying to do in terms of the balance for the rest of the quarter is really balancing that, okay, there's five fewer days, yes. But there are also, you've got more days before Christmas when you move it to the middle of the week. And so we have a wide range in the fourth quarter, but that contemplates that balance of her buying for need and then buying closer to the need and how that unfolds, especially with the five fewer days. But the set is fantastic, especially when you look at the holiday set, what we're seeing, what we're seeing in toys, what we're seeing in trimming hard, trimming gift, trimming tree. We really like the cadence we're seeing of the customer as she navigates through this holiday. Yes, I'll take the first part and Jeff to take the margin. When you look at the customer cohort, our low-end customer is definitely pressured. We see that. We see that she is clearly focused on consumables. We see a rise in the eat at home, which helps us, and you see that in our consumables comp. And then the low -- the middle income and even the higher income is still feeling some pressure. And basically, when you look at a year ago, they were cutting out big purchases. TV, things like that. If you look at the early part of this year, they started eating more at home and cutting going out. Now they're reducing some parties, and we see that or the party is not as big, they don't invite as many people as they did. So we're seeing that throughout. But I think when you look at the share we're taking and you look at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar as an answer for this customer as they're pursuing need and closer to need, we like what we're seeing from that customer. The shift is tough. It is really tough to start the year when you have Thanksgiving later and all those days are comping against days from last year that are different in the calendar. Look, it happens every six years. It's one of the things that we have to deal with. And it definitely is a reason for the soft start. But when we double-click and we look into fall in Thanksgiving sell-through. When we double-click on some of the early subcategories for Christmas. We believe that we're set up really well for the fourth quarter and our guidance implies that we'll hit that low-single-digit in both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. Sure. Yes, it was a really nice quarter at Family Dollar. And one of the things I mentioned in my remarks earlier is that we feel that, yes, you've got some of the SNAP that you're sunsetting over time, but it's still an impact. We feel the actions we took and the team took to really improve the discretionary, move a little bit on the discretionary side to the, if you will, the consumable side of discretionary. The things that people will buy more often and buy each year or each quarter within the discretionary. We feel that, that's set and the resets that we've done to the stores, targeted end-caps that really provide the customer with what they need. We believe those are long lived. We believe that the actions we're taking today help us as we go through. And then the changes to the stores, when you, over 1,500 renovations now. Our 2.5s, which is our latest and greatest format. I mean the comps are fantastic and really fueling it. And then the XSBs which is this urban smaller footprint store is resonating incredibly well with the customer. Those changes are long lasting. Those are the ones that really help us. Sure. First of all, the customer response has been incredibly positive to multi-price. If you look the basket has five more units in it. It's nearly double the value of a traditional Dollar Tree basket and we're seeing more trips from the customer in terms of our typical customer, which means they're really embracing that treasure hunt of what they'll find on the next visit via multi-price. In terms of the cadence, not all conversions are created equal. When you're going, if you look at Q1, the vast majority of those stores were going from what we call a 1.0. So just $1.25, they don't have Dollar Tree Plus, they don't have the three, four, five coolers. And so they're going from a 1.0 all the way to a 3.0. And we look at Q2 that was kind of balanced across the two cohorts going from a 1.0 to a 3.0 versus a 2.0 to 3.0. When I look at the Q3, and this is where the decal comes in, we were 75% coming from 2.0 to 3.0. And as we look out, we have to convert them by distribution center. And so when you pick a distribution center that's heavily geographically weighted on Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, you also tend to hit maybe some of our harder geographies and you hit stores that already have Dollar Tree Plus. So what we've done is we look out over next year as we're really trying to balance that out. So that we keep a perspective of that 1.0 to 3.0 and 2.0 to 3.0 in terms of the balance. One of the things I'm most encouraged by, though, is as multi-price unfolds, the stores from Q1 continue to be our strongest. Q2, second strongest, and then Q3. So the longer they're on multi-price, the more the customer finds it and the more the customer shops it and the better the experience is. And then finally one of the -- when you look at some of the geographies of going from 1.0 to 3.0 as we did in Q1, they got the very best of the learnings of Dollar Tree Plus from the last couple of years. And so as we go back we now take those Dollar Tree Plus learnings and we revisit other Dollar Tree Plus stores and we're upgrading. We're taking some categories out or some SKUs out and we're adding in ones that resonate better. Categories that were a bigger hit or SKUs that really resonated with our customer and help them. So this is -- we're nine months into this. This is still test and learn, but we like what we're learning and we love what the customer is experiencing and the feedback that they're giving us. Yes. So, John, it's -- first in terms of the non- 3.0 performance. It's not just about the base stores. We'll get to those, we'll convert them. I think one of the keys in accelerating the non-3.0 is in what we're doing going back to Dollar Tree Plus, which has been in place for several years now and refreshing that. We take whole sections and refresh them and really like the results that we're seeing. In terms of the \u2013 and, yes, we did see one of the -- we always measure our gap in terms of how are multi-price comparing to the chain. And one of the reasons that gap closed is the chain got better. Dollar Tree Plus, definitely, those base stores got closer to multi-price, which is encouraging. And then there's two ways to accelerate, the first is in the conversions themselves. And you'll see we slowed that conversion. Part of that is just from an execution standpoint. We introduced some milestones where we said our district manager has to sign off in a store four weeks before we go live and then a regional director, our next level up, has to sign off on a store two weeks before. And they have the power to say, no, yes. They have the power to say we need some support to make sure we're ready or change or whatever reason they might have. And so it does slow us, but we believe that done right is better than done fast there. And that's not our only means of accelerating. We also have the opportunity to go back in and look at the SKUs that are working for us. We're several years into Dollar Tree Plus. We're only nine months into multi-price 3.0. Going back and looking at what resonated with the customer and how do we change going forward? How do we change a season? How do we change in every day. And then finally and this kind of goes to the rollout cadence. Yes, we leverage third-party. You see that in our SG&A, but there's also an org capacity that we're managing through. And one of the reasons we slowed in Q3 is we had all those $0.99 onlys that opened in Q3. That taps on a lot of the same resources in terms of our store setup crews, the leadership that goes out and works these stores. And so we shifted rightly. We wanted to get those $0.99 only stores converted as quickly as we could so that we didn't let a customer forget about us. If we can flip those in 30 days or 60 days, that's far better than 90 days or 120 days. The longer you're close, the more likelihood is the customer will change their habit. We put a ton of focus on getting those stores open. As you saw, we have almost all of them now open and converted and now we can kind of put some resources back towards that multi-price rollout in '25. Yes. So the 5.1 was just how did the Q1 conversions perform in Q2. That's what that was. And as I roll that out to Q3, Simeon, those Q1 conversions continue to be the strongest performing then Q2 and then Q3 in that order. So the longer they're on, the better they perform. And going from a 1.0 to a 3.0 to use our parlance, $1.25 is a 1.0, $1.3 plus is a 2.0, multi-price in-line is a 3.0. The stores that went from 1.0 to 3.0 have the biggest bang. We see them because they're getting everything, if you will. And so then we go back to stores that just have Dollar Tree Plus and we take the learnings of what's working what's resonating the most and we go upgrade those stores. And physically the cost we have for resetting the store, we get that once. Yes, it plays out because of the conversions over 18 months or two years. But we don't have to go back and change hardware in that store. We don't have to add steel. We do that once. And then Rick and his team can go and make sure we have the best assortment that's resonating the most with the customer. And so as you look at that cadence, yes, our Q3 were the softest. They had the fewest amount of 1.0 all the way to 3.0. And I also think there's some geography mix in there. If you look, I mentioned in the Q2 call, we saw California really resonate well with multi-price. Florida, we expect to resonate well. We did have some execution issues. I was really pleased to see them kind of have a stronger Q2. And now as we look at the Q3 sets, we're more in our kind of Midwest area and it doesn't have the same pop that we saw in California and now in Florida. Sure. Yes, I've been here more than two years now. My family and I absolutely love the area. It is a great community to be a part of. I've gotten to know the founders here of Dollar Tree, gotten to know a lot of people, our kids go to school together, those types of things. So I'm really embraced this company, this culture and its future. And so that has been just amazing and very humbling. So I'm excited about that. In terms of the changes, our focus is on the successful execution of the Family Dollar strategic review and setting up Dollar Tree for a multiyear kind of next chapter if you will. That's my focus. That's what the Board's charged me with. And when we look at the pluses and minuses of that, we're going to continue to test and learn. We're going to continue to make enhancements to the business and what resonates the most with our customer. And we're always going to start with our customer and work our way back that doesn't change. So multi-price is a perfect example of that. It's amazing what resonates and what doesn't. And we'll continue to kind of work that to make sure we're relevant for the customer. But it's exciting what we see. The increased trips, the bigger basket really like to see how the customer is responding to it. And then in terms of the leadership changes both Jocy Konrad and Jason Nordin have been here a year now, have both had a big impact on store standards, big impact with our associates. And it's just as I looked at the next chapter, as I look at the next five years for Family Dollar, the next five years for Dollar Tree, I wanted to make sure we had the folks that were best suited to that role. So Jason's prior role at Pilot Flying J fits really well with Family Dollar, the convenience element of it. The high consumables element of it. Jocy Konrad is the first to say. She's one of our biggest customer. She's a crafter. She resonates incredibly well with the team. And so I think these changes position us really well for that next chapter of Family Dollar post review and Dollar Tree go forward. Jeff, I'll let you handle that. Jeff, why don't you take the first one. Yes. The only thing I'd add is these investments that drive the depreciation, the investments we've had to do, the investments we want to do, the cost comes right away, the benefit, the returns come over time. I think new store openings, I'm incredibly excited about the pace with which we're opening new stores now compared to in the past. And the real benefit of new stores comes in that year two, year three, year four before they reach kind of the maturity of the enterprise, both in sales and in their profitability. And so you get that over time, that benefit. And that's a great example of you hit the cost now, the depreciation over time, but the real benefit in the accelerating benefit is a little delayed. Then the second thing I'll just say on the leverage is and I've been in small box for a while, small box math is a beautiful thing. The more sales you can drive through that box, the better you're going to leverage because you get to a point where you need so many people to open the store and close the store, but you can increase the sales and not have to increase the ton of the payroll and that's really where the leverage comes. So our focus is on retail fundamentals that will drive those sales per box. Jeff? Thank you for your time today. Look forward to wishing everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season. Thanks so much."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Robert LaFleur, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nRobert LaFleur: Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss Dollar Tree's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results.

Given the number of callers who would like to participate in today's session, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Creedon: Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Creedon. I'm Dollar Tree's Chief Operating Officer and I'm happy to pinch-hit for Rick this morning. When Rick first joined Dollar Tree as Executive Chairman and again last year when he became CEO, he told you that he came here to lead a transformation with the primary goal of helping this company realize its full potential. He's also said that transformations are rarely easy or linear and that is especially true for a company as large as ours that is navigating through one of the most challenging macro environments we've ever seen. That said Rick and all of us on the senior leadership team believe very deeply in this transformation and the positive impact we're having in the areas we control. We also believe very deeply in the importance of providing the high-quality, low-cost products that individuals and families need in a convenient and comfortable shopping environment. We are also committed to serving the communities where we operate. And most importantly, we are aware of the awesome responsibility we have each and every day to serve our customers, associates and shareholders. Clearly, we are not pleased with our second quarter results or having to revise our full year outlook. But this updated outlook reflects how the challenging macro environment continues to pressure our customers. It also reflects some revised financial estimates that we will discuss shortly. That said, we will also talk about several areas where we are performing well and where our transformation initiatives are taking hold. And I will share where we are heading as a company and why we are still so excited about our future. So, let's get started. Sales came in towards the low end of our outlook range. Family Dollar's comp was in line, but Dollar Tree's comp, while positive, was lower than we expected. As we have seen for several quarters now, demand from Family Dollar's core lower-income customer remains weak. Dollar Tree has a broader customer base that includes more middle and upper-income households. And beginning this quarter, we started to see inflation, interest rates and other macro pressures have a more pronounced impact on the buying behavior of these customers. This impacted our second quarter comp performance and is the primary driver of our revised full year outlook. Despite these near-term pressures, we are confident in the Dollar Tree segment's ability to compete and win. Our offerings provide customers with exceptional values that are well matched to the current environment. We are strong believers in the inherent strength of Dollar Tree's differentiated business model and its long-term strategy of multi-price expansion and store growth acceleration. Today, we need to be sensitive and responsive to the needs of our customers and meet them where they are and how they are living. In this environment, retailers who can offer products to provide value and convenience to pressured consumers are the ones who will take market share and grow sales. We believe we are and will continue to be one of those winning retailers. Before getting into the rest of the details on the second quarter, let us acknowledge that Dollar Tree's comp store performance was just part of the lower-than-expected Q2 earnings. The most significant component, $0.30 of EPS that wasn't in our June outlook, was related to general liability claims. Predicting these claims is complex and we again increased our accrual for general liability this quarter after observing higher-than-expected costs to resolve certain claims. Jeff will give you the full details on this in a few minutes. Again, in this evolving economic backdrop, our team remains focused on factors that are within our control, including the rollout of key transformation initiatives. Dollar Tree's multi-price expansion continues to resonate with our customers and the 1,600 stores that have been converted into our newest in-line format are seeing an outsized sales lift. As we talked about last quarter, we are building new muscle memory with multi-price. This rollout is a process and we are constantly making adjustments based on our learnings from earlier rounds of conversions. For example, we are now prioritizing ready-to-convert stores and moving them to the front of the line, ahead of stores that may need some additional prep work before they can realize the full range of conversion benefits. As we've taken the time to incorporate these learnings, we're a few 100 stores behind our original schedule, but we've learned that it's better to get the conversions done right than to rush the process. The most important thing is that the customer response is validating our strategy, because our biggest challenge now is keeping up with the demand for the new assortment. To give you a sense of how these stores are performing, comps for the 1,600 stores we've converted were up 4.6% in the second quarter versus less than 0.5% at our other formats. Our Q1 conversions, who had the benefit of the new multi-price format and assortment for all of Q2, did a 5.1% comp. Importantly, these in-line stores showed strength across the assortment with a 6.7% consumables comp and a 2.6% discretionary comp. Considering the vast majority of our new discretionary multi-price items won't be in these stores until later this year, we are very pleased with these early results. We also believe that, over time, our expanded discretionary multi-price offerings will help us overcome some of the macro-driven weakness we're seeing elsewhere in the portfolio. We believe the expansion of in-line multi-price across the Dollar Tree portfolio will be a major growth driver for many years to come. Today, less than 15% of our SKUs are multi-price. In addition to driving comp, the higher gross profit dollars per item generated by this assortment should provide a meaningful lift to store economics over time. As excited as we are about these initial results, we believe we are still in the very early innings with many years of runway ahead of us. We're also happy to announce that as of today, we've reopened approximately 85 former 99 Cents Only locations as Dollar Trees. In fact, another 20 stores are reopening tomorrow and the remaining 56 should reopen by the end of the year. Getting this done from scratch in less than 100 days required a massive effort across multiple teams. That's a real accomplishment. I would like to thank everyone involved for all their hard work. These 99 Cents Only locations are proven, high-quality stores in strong markets with great growth potential. We're very excited about expanding our footprint across California and the Southwest and we couldn't be more pleased with the reception we've received from the communities who've welcomed us. This transaction was a rare opportunity to acquire a portfolio of assets under very favorable lease terms. We expect these stores will provide compelling unit-level economics and positive synergies across our network. While we have to absorb some unanticipated upfront costs that Jeff will talk about in a minute, this is still a great deal. In supply chain, our DC in West Memphis, Arkansas, has reopened and is now making deliveries. Recall that after we lost our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma, we decided to temporarily repurpose West Memphis to support the Dollar Tree banner. We're also making good progress on RotaCarts. West Memphis is servicing over 600 Dollar Tree and combo stores with RotaCarts, and by next year, it will be able to handle an additional 150 stores. Elsewhere, our DC in Matthews, North Carolina is delivering to Family Dollar Stars with RotaCarts and we're serving approximately 300 Dollar Tree stores with RotaCarts out of our DC here in Chesapeake, Virginia. By the end of the year, four DCs should be providing RotaCart deliveries to over 2,000 stores. We're collecting lots of data from initial deployments and refining our rollout plans based on what we learn along the way. In IT, Bobby Aflatooni and his team are making great progress across our modernization initiatives. Our new warehouse management system went live at its first two DCs, with two more slated for early next year. Across both banners, we've transitioned over 9,000 stores to our network infrastructure, which supports business operations by improving Internet connectivity, security and in-store Wi-Fi access for associates. Additionally, we've created an entirely new infrastructure to support the multi-price rollout, including shelf tag label printers, in-store price checkers, and back office functionality. Our Family Dollar Private Brands program continues to gain momentum. Private Brands contributed 16% of consumable sales in the quarter, which puts us well ahead of schedule to hit our 70% year-end target. Year-to-date, we've added 75 new SKUs across food, HBA, and household products and Private Brands now represent 9% of Family Dollar SKUs. Among categories, we're seeing strong growth in food and we see great potential in HBA, where we remain under-indexed. Shrink remains a major topic across retail. While shrink remains unacceptably high, it appears to be stabilizing. While it is too early to declare victory, I am pleased that our targeted actions and interventions helped our second quarter shrink rate. We are running ahead of shrink expectations at Family Dollar and still have some additional work to do at Dollar Tree as we adjust to the new shrink challenges that arise when we introduce more high-value, multi-price products into the assortment. Now, let's move to the financial highlights from the quarter. On a consolidated basis, net sales increased 0.7% to $7.4 billion. Enterprise comp increased 0.7% on a 1.1% traffic increase, partially offset by a 0.5% average ticket decline. Looking at performance by banner, Dollar Tree comps increased 1.3% on a 1.4% traffic increase, modestly offset by a 0.1% average ticket decline. While comps were positive in each month, they softened sequentially throughout the quarter. While discretionary products remain an integral part of Dollar Tree's retail mission. Our sales mix has shifted towards consumables in recent years. For example, Dollar Tree's consumable mix increased 210 basis points in the second quarter to 50.6%. Part of this shift reflects softer discretionary demand, but part of it is tied to some timing differences in our latest multi-price rollout. Given their shorter lead times, many of the earliest items we introduced were consumables. In the back half of the year, our discretionary mix should improve as more longer lead time discretionary items, particularly in seasonal, finally arrive in our stores. Dollar Tree's consumable comp was 4.7% against a very challenging 13.2% comp last year. While discretionary comp was down 1.9% on the unfavorable mix, this was a sequential improvement from the Easter-related challenges we faced in Q1. Consumable categories like candy, apparel, snacks and beverages were our best performing areas in Q2, while higher-margin discretionary categories like crafts, floral, and home decor underperformed. After several quarters of strong growth, Dollar Tree's unit and dollar market share gains moderated in the second quarter. Dollar Tree attracted 2.8 million net new shoppers over the past 12 months. In the Family Dollar segment, customer traffic and average ticket largely offset as comps declined 0.1%. Comps were positive in the middle month of the quarter and negative in the first and last months. Customer traffic increased 0.7%, while average decreased traffic, 0.8%. Our consumables comp increased 0.3% on top of a strong 9.5% comp in Q2 last year. Discretionary comp declined 1.7%, a 300 basis point sequential improvement over Q1. The improving trend in discretionary comp reflects recent efforts to improve our assortment by emphasizing more relevant items with higher purchase frequency. Standouts for best performing categories were evenly split across discretionary and consumables, including beverages, apparel, health OTC, and personal care. Meanwhile, bottom-performing categories like home decor, seasonal, and beauty skewed towards discretionary. Family Dollar's unit and market share were essentially flat in the quarter. Family Dollar attracted 1.8 million net new shoppers over the past 12 months. Let's also update you on SNAP benefits. As you may know, over 40% of Family Dollar customers are eligible for some form of government assistance, including SNAP, and those benefits are a meaningful part of their household resources. We have cycled most of last year's benefit reductions and we believe the worst is now behind us. In the second quarter, reduced SNAP benefits were a 60 basis point comp headwind for Family Dollar, significantly better than the 280 basis-point impact we saw in Q1 and the 500 basis point impact in Q4 of last year. And one last point to share on SNAP, Family Dollar customers can now buy SNAP eligible products online through Instacart delivery. This collaboration reduces transportation dependency by giving customers access to same day delivery of Family Dollar products. This is a logical extension of our mission to help individuals and families do more with less by making essential goods more affordable and accessible. Now, let us share some thoughts on a few other top-of-mind issues. We know that tariffs have been a big topic recently. In the event of any meaningful change to the current tariff regime, we have long-standing contingency plans to diversify our supply chain in a timely and cost-effective manner. We also have the flexibility to adjust product specs and price points to address any changes in the market. Regarding ocean freight, our exposure to spot rates remains limited as the vast majority of our capacity is covered by annual or long-term contracts. With limited near-term exposure to container rate volatility, our outlook for ocean and domestic freight remains positive. Regarding changes to overtime thresholds for salary workers under the Fair Labor Standards Act, we fully absorbed the first phase of this in early July. The next proposed phase, which raises the July salary threshold by an additional 34%, is scheduled to go into effect on January 1st of next year. However, there is significant uncertainty over when and if this change will be implemented. We are evaluating multiple mitigation strategies to address the proposed rules. And finally, we wanted to provide an update and let you know what we are making good progress on our strategic review at Family Dollar, which includes evaluating a full range of pathways to maximize shareholder value. As we discussed in June, our transformation includes operational and business improvements, such as multi-price at Dollar Tree, as well as this more holistic evaluation of the best structure and pathway for our Family Dollar business. We understand that there are many questions on this topic and we reiterate our commitment to update you when we reach the conclusion of the review. The actions we took earlier this year at Family Dollar to close underperforming stores are having the intended impact, and our remaining Family Dollar stores are focused on providing service and value to our customers across the country each and every day. Before wrapping up, we'd like to share a few thoughts about our revised outlook. We've adjusted our sales outlook to better reflect where the consumer is today as they continue to adapt to the evolving macro landscape. Regarding the 99 Cents Only portfolio, our revised outlook reflects a better estimate of the one-time pre-opening costs associated with these stores and better than what we had when the transaction first closed. Finally, it is also the adjustment to our general liability exposure and our latest D&A forecast, which Jeff will discuss in a moment. We are comfortable with this reset, given where the customer and the business are today, and we are confident in our ability to execute against our objectives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Davis: Thank you, Mike, and good morning. I'll start off by discussing our second quarter results, after which I'll provide some comments on our third quarter and fiscal 2024 outlook. Where applicable, I will focus on our adjusted results. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in our earnings release. Second quarter results obviously fell short of our expectations. Our adjusted EPS of $0.67 was $0.38 below the midpoint of our June outlook. Of that $0.38, $0.30 was attributable to the general liability adjustment, while the remaining $0.08 was attributable to the flow-through from the sales shortfall, mostly in the Dollar Tree segment. As Mike indicated, Dollar Tree's comp softness was primarily on the discretionary side of the business and reflected the increasing effect of macro pressures on the purchasing behavior of the Dollar Tree's middle and higher income-customers. Our original second quarter outlook did not anticipate those pressures migrating to Dollar Tree's customer base to the degree that they did. Turning to the business results on a consolidated basis. Adjusted operating income was $218 million, a 24% decrease from last year. Adjusted operating margin decreased by approximately 90 basis points to 3%, reflecting an 80 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 180 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin improvement came primarily from lower freight costs, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and higher occupancy costs. Adjusted SG&A increased primarily from the general liability adjustment, higher depreciation, temporary labor for Dollar Tree's multi-price rollout, higher utility costs, and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower incentive comp cost. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.2%, compared to 24%. Adjusted net income was $143 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67. Let me take a step back and offer additional details around the general liability adjustment we made in the quarter. As we stated before, predicting the outcome of both existing and unreported claims is inherently complex, particularly as general liability claims have become more volatile in recent years. Due to the increase in estimated liabilities for these claims, we took an incremental $84 million charge or $0.30 of EPS against our prior outlook, with about $0.21 of that pertaining to Dollar Tree and the balance to Family Dollar. So, what's going on here and why are we talking about this again. Given the size and scale of our footprint, we managed thousands of general liability claims stemming from customer accidents and other incidents at our stores and surrounding areas. While some claims are current, many relate to prior years. Overtime, the ultimate outcome of claims particularly older claims during the pandemic and post-pandemic time frame has become increasingly challenged to predict given the higher settlement and litigation costs that have resulted from a more volatile insurance environment. For these reasons, twice a year, we rely on third-party actuarial assessments and assumptions to evaluate accruals for open claims, as well as incurred but not yet reported claims. The claims have continued to develop unfavorably due to the rising cost to reimburse, settle and litigate these claims, which impacted our actuarily determined liabilities. While exposure to general liability claims remain difficult to forecast, we believe the adjustment we took in Q2 captures the current range of potential outcomes, based on what we have experienced in recent years. Now, let's move on to our business segment results. At Dollar Tree, adjusted operating income decreased 13% to $344 million. Adjusted operating margin decreased 190 basis points, driven by a 80 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 270 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin improved primarily from lower freight costs. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and occupancy cost. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily due to the general liability adjustment, higher depreciation, temporary labor for the multi-price rollout, higher utility costs, and sales deleverage. At Family Dollar, adjusted operating loss was $3.6 million, compared to adjusted operating income of $11.8 million last year. Adjusted operating margin decreased 40 basis points on a 50 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 100 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin increased primarily from lower freight and occupancy costs, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix, higher distribution costs, and markdowns. Adjusted SG&A rate increased primarily from higher depreciation and amortization, the general liability charge, and sales deleverage. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory decreased by 4% or $228 million. Average inventory per store decreased 3.6%. On a related note, to-date, we have received $70.8 million of insurance proceeds related to the inventory loss and property damage at our Marietta, Oklahoma DC. We expect the remaining $46 million of outstanding losses will be fully recovered under our existing insurance policies in due course. With cash and cash equivalents of $570 million and long-term debt of $3.4 billion, our balance sheet remains strong. Our bank-defined leverage at quarter-end stood at approximately 2.5 times, which continues to underpin our investment-grade creditworthiness. On the cash flow statement, we generated $307 million from operating activities, compared to $172 million last year. Capital expenditures were $501 million in the quarter versus $425 million last year, reflecting the accelerated new store openings and ongoing investments in growth and other initiatives. Our free cash flow in the quarter improved $60 million over last year. Consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation after investing in the growth of our business this quarter, we returned $91 million to our shareholders by repurchasing 750,000 shares at an average price of $120 per share. At quarter-end, we had approximately $952 million remaining under our existing share repurchase program. Now, let me provide some perspective on our third quarter and full year expectations. Our current revised outlook reflects the following. We are taking a more conservative view towards comp sales in the back half of the year, particularly in the Dollar Tree segment, as macro factors continue to weigh on customer sentiment and adversely affect discretionary demand and buying behavior. It also reflects one-time integration costs related to the 99 Cents Only lease acquisitions, because time was of the essence in acquiring these leases and in a competitive bidding process, the time between when we took physical possession of these properties and when we and when they opened was longer than expected. As a result, we are incurring upfront occupancy costs like rent, insurance and security for an extended period before the stores open. We announced this transaction a week before or prior to our last earnings call and these additional upfront costs were not anticipated in the outlook we gave at that time. All-in, we estimate these incremental upfront costs will negatively impact third quarter EPS by approximately $0.07 and fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.05. On a positive note , the initial sales performance of the converted and reopened stores is exceeding our initial expectations and we are increasingly bullish regarding the long-term prospect for this portfolio. We are also expecting higher D&A expense in the back half of the year after reforecasting our capital projects to reflect higher anticipated costs for projects, such as new stores, renovations, and our IT transformation, as well as the timing of receipt for vendor invoices. This is expected to be an incremental EPS headwind of approximately $0.12, split evenly between Q3 and Q4. On the positive side of the ledger, we saw some green shoots in discretionary mix at Family Dollar in Q2, which is so far carried into Q3. We are assuming this trend continues for the balance of the year and are now expecting a modest mix headwind for Family Dollar in the back half. The better initial performance at the converted 99 Cents Only stores is also reflected in our revised sales outlook. From a modeling perspective, it's also worth reminding everyone that sales from these and all new stores won't show up in our comp store net sales until after they've been open for 15 months. And finally, payroll should come in lower than previously forecast as we align incentive comp and hours with our revised business outlook. With that background, for the third quarter, we expect net sales will be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, based on low-single digit comp net sales growth for the enterprise and both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Adjusting for the stores that were closed as part of the portfolio optimization, we expect third quarter net sales for the Family Dollar segment to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. We expect adjusted EPS will be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15, which reflects a more conservative sales outlook, the incremental upfront cost of the 99 Cents Only stores, and the D&A reforecast. For the full year, we expect net sales to be in the range of $30.6 billion to $30.9 billion, based on low-single digit comp net sales growth for the enterprise and both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Adjusting for stores closed as part of the portfolio optimization in the extra week in fiscal 2023, we expect full year net sales for Family Dollar to decline by 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.60, reflecting our second quarter results, our revised sales forecast, the 99 Cents Only cost, and D&A. In the interest of time, I will direct you to our supplemental financial presentation, which is available on our IR website, for the remaining details that support our current outlook. So, to recap, we're revising the midpoint of our full year 2024 outlook from $5.40 from $6.75. Of that $1.35 delta, $0.38 came from Q2 shortfall, the vast majority of which came from the general liability adjustment. Then in the back half of the year, $0.12 is from the higher upfront cost in the 99 Cents Only portfolio. Another $0.12 is from the D&A adjustment and the remaining $0.73 is primarily from the flow-through on the lowered sales outlook, which is mostly due to our more conservative outlook for discretionary sales at Dollar Tree. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.\nMike Creedon: Thanks, Jeff. On behalf of Rick and the entire senior management team, I want to thank our teams for their continued hard work in a very challenging macro environment and for supporting our strategic review of Family Dollar. Our strategic review is looking at the full range of alternatives for Family Dollar with a focus on clearly demonstrating the full value of our two distinct franchises. Despite significant headwinds, our Dollar Tree banners comp remains positive even as they lap two years of extremely strong performance. Our non-multi-price stores were modestly positive this quarter and our newly converted multi-price stores produced a 4.6% comp. This is one of the best multi-year comp performances in all of retail. Most importantly, we have just begun to roll out our expanded multi-price SKUs and we still have thousands of stores to convert to our new format. On top of that, we're opening hundreds of brand new in-line multi-price stores this year and plan to do so for many years to come. In light of all this, we continue to believe that Dollar Tree is one of the strongest platforms in all of retail with many years of strong comp and store growth still ahead of us. Operator, with that, Jeff and I are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, while we poll for your questions. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. So putting aside what has been happening at Family Dollar, the core Dollar Tree banner has a number of tailwinds, such as multi-price point, freight improvements, and others, yet a series of unexpected items that have indicated to be one-time in nature have consistently been dragging down the earnings of this business. So, at what point can it move past the one-time in nature items and be on a consistent glide path forward? And as part of that, what is an updated realistic operating margin for core Dollar Tree if it is a long-term low-single-digit comp grower? Thank you very much.\nJeff Davis: Yeah. Good morning, Michael. This is Jeff. I'll take a portion of that question regarding general liability and some of the other elements. You point out, I think, a very valid point. The general liability adjustments we had to take is one that we're not happy with. It's one in which, as I had mentioned in my remarks, it is very complex as a result of how these claims develop over time and having new information around that. We believe that the adjustment that we've taken today reflects not only that historic performance, our current outcomes as it relates to how these claims are developing, but we're also making sure that we're not anticipating any improvement in these claims experience on a go-forward basis. Thus, we feel more confident around the adjustment that we've taken reflects the current liability that is sitting out there for, once again, not only these existing claims, but the claims that have yet to be reported. That's the best way I can respond to that to you to Michael, that we believe we now have this behind us. The second portion of your question, I believe, was around where do we think the operating margins of the long-term operating margins of the business would be. As we continue to drive multi-price and we're going to continue to drive higher gross profit dollars per transaction, we believe that as we move forward and we get beyond some of the higher transformation costs that we're experiencing right now as it relates to some of the IT investments that we're making, supply chain investments, that we'll be able to achieve the outlook that we had provided previously on the longer-term basis for the business. I don't want to give any longer-term view of the business other than what we've already given. In our outlook for the quarter, we said that, once again, Family Dollar, I'm sorry, Dollar Tree is going to be low-single-digits. We said that the, one second here, in our financial let's see if I can find it real quick.\nMike Creedon: And while Jeff's doing that, Michael, the mix we see too on the multi-price, remember, it comes in heavy consumable first because that's what we could get in the short order. As you look to enter the back half of the year with the holidays, you get that discretionary benefit from the multi-price rollout.\nJeff Davis: Yeah, I found it here, Michael. I just want to make sure that I quoted this appropriately. As it relates to 2024 outlook, we still believe that the gross margins on the Dollar Tree business will be in the range of 36% and the flow-throughs that we've had previously, we said on a consolidated basis, the SG&A will be approximately 26% and the SG&A outlook on the Dollar Tree segment already reflects the additional costs that we've had as it relates to the approximately 2,800 stores that we're going to convert to multi-price. That's the other headwind that we have currently in the business as we're using third-party labor for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nEdward Kelly: Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. So I want to just take a step back given the, I guess, the overhangs and the questions that investors really have at this point. As you think about multi-price point at Dollar Tree, how confident are you that some of the weakness we've seen recently is just macro as, opposed to push back on the multi-price point strategy? I know you have the conversions that are doing well, but I think $3 and $5 are in many more stores. Just curious, just like what you think consumers are really saying there? And then you had optimism around Q4. So, when do you think you can start to turn the corner? And then the other thing is Family Dollar, and I don't know what you can say, but is there anything you can tell us around your confidence in your ability to come to some resolution in that business that is accretive to shareholder value? Thank you.\nMike Creedon: Yeah, and it's Mike. I'll take the first one. We said we're still in the early innings of multi-price and I'll tell you that we like what the customer is telling us with multi-price. So we're surveying our customers, we're listening to them. They're telling us with their comps. I highlighted how strong our multi-price stores are performing compared to stores that just have the $1.25. And we're really growing traffic. We're adding new customers and our customers are letting us know that they like the product. And then when you look to the second half, we really think they're going to like the discretionary product. So we've seen it as our stores have set. Our associates are our customers and our associates are telling us they love this multi-price product. They're excited about the holiday season and all that. So we'll continue to learn as we go. We've made changes. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're a couple of hundred stores behind where we are. That's because we want to be better. We want to get it right when we roll them out. And so, we took the approach. We added some, call it, milestones or stop gates to say, we're not going to convert a store unless that store is ready to be converted, so we can improve what the customer sees when they come in and the overall performance of the multi-price stores. And then, Jeff, I'll let you talk to the FD strategic.\nJeff Davis: Yeah. Just a couple of things to add to that. If you think about the Dollar Tree segment, last year this time, we added over 2 million new customers. We're now lapping that. We continue to add beyond that. So it is absolutely resonating with the customer. If you think about the fact that we continue to maintain our market share in this environment at a time when we're actually seeing customers contract their spend, it's not that we are seeing, it's a combination of things. So we're seeing contraction of spend. We're not seeing necessarily a loss from a competitive standpoint. So we continue to add new customers, maintain market share, continue to resonate with the customer when Mike had spoken about the new in-line conversion stores, that multi-price delivering 6%-plus comps in consumables and even positive almost a 3% comp in discretionary. So very, very favorable for us. As it relates to Family Dollar, we're excited about what we're seeing in Family Dollar also. From a standpoint of we're starting to actually see some discretionary improvement, we believe we're beyond the biggest headwinds that we've had with respect to the customer with SNAP. We're continuing to see improvement in shrink. We've invested in people time, technology and systems on the Family Dollar side and this proof points are really starting to deliver and improve shrink results there. The customer is resonating with a number of the resets that we've had. It's just that customer right now is under some of the more significant budget pressures and they're working through it. And when we're seeing that customer use all tenders, not only that may be government assistance, but also using credit where it makes sense.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mike, I wanted to start with Dollar Tree. Thinking about multi-price rollout, can you remind us what's the timing of the rollout? Why can you go quicker and if labor is a constraint, does it make sense to hire your own? And then was there any rhyme or reason for the first 1,600 stores, so thinking about what the results could look like further downstream as you get further along the way?\nMike Creedon: Sure, Simeon. So there's two pieces to this. One is the bandwidth of our own internal team to get these stores done with both the new store openings we're doing, renovations we're doing, and the multi-price rollout. That's why we really leaned on third-party to take off as much as we could and go as quickly as we could. The other gating process is, as we turn our distribution network on with multi-price that then feeds the stores that we convert. So there is a little bit of a gating factor in terms of the product coming in, the DC being set for multi-price and being able to service those stores. So we'll do when you look at it, we set a couple of hundred behind this year. So instead of 3,000, that's 2,800 or more. But then there's another 300 new stores that open up multi-price as well. And you'll see a similar cadence each year as we go through to all stores that we can put multi-price in. So it's really a question of our own bandwidth to process it and then our ability to work with vendors to get it into our DCs and get it out to the stores. I'll tell you, Simeon, when we do the execution right, the only challenge we have is keeping up with the product, because the customers love it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks. So, Mike, at the Dollar Tree banner, could you elaborate on the softening progression of same-store sales in the second quarter? And any change in trends that you've seen so far in the third quarter? And then just larger picture, I guess, maybe could you speak to performance versus plan in the roughly 80% of your doors at Dollar Tree outside of the 1,600 converted stores? I think you cited these as flattish comps this quarter. But pre-pandemic, 2017 to 2019, Dollar Tree banner comps were pretty consistently in that 3% run rate. Just how best to think about the difference in the core doors relative to pre-pandemic performance?\nMike Creedon: Sure, Matt. Good morning. So, first, in terms of the trends, I think it's a little bit of the, I call it, the who, the how, and the what. The who is the income level. While we saw in Family Dollar early that the low-income pressured shopper, we saw that drift up and materially drift up in the second quarter as the middle income, the greater than $125,000, that person started feeling the pressure as well from the macro environment. And then the how, they shifted to buying for need versus buying for want. And so really that showed in our discretionary mix, leaning towards consumables. And then finally, the what. This started with sensitivity on big ticket items and has come all the way now to us as people have maybe changed how they celebrate a party this summer, fewer guests, fewer parties. They're really tightening their belts and the macro economy is driving them to behave a bit differently. And so when we look at all those things together, that really pressured us. As you look then at how we exit and where we go, I'll tell you, Q2 is always one of those quarters where there's really no holiday. All you have is 4th of July, whereas Q3, we get back to school and Halloween. And then when you look at Q4, you get that harvest, you get Christmas, and really that demands you go to Dollar Tree. It's we help people celebrate their lives and so that gets our people coming in. So those were the trends. And as we look out, I think, Jeff would say, our current trends reflect our overall forecast right now. And then finally, on the core doors, I mean, I would tell you, I still think, yes, they were in that 0.5%. But you look at some of the two-year stacks, when you really look at the multi-year performance of these stores, I think, it's some of the best in retail. And as we roll out the multi-price, we really feed that thrill of the hunt and we get it to more doors. They come in for the thrill of the hunt on the multi-price and we get to sell the rest of the store. So I really think we end up getting that boost to the core from the rest from the rollout of multi-price.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Heinbockel: Hey, Mike, couple of quick things. When you look at those 1,600 stores, can you touch on volume, right, in that comp, right, the unit throughput, the multi-price point penetration? And then when you think about consumable, right, so at Dollar Tree, the consumable share gains, right, kind of flattened out a little bit. Do you think that's more, it's more you, do you think it's the competition? And what's the plan for I know you want to get to eight of 10 doors multi-price point. I think you're at three today. What's the plan now to get there, go faster, go slower? What's the thought?\nMike Creedon: Yeah. So, to the first one, as we roll out the 1,600, right now, you get that mix, where early on, it's consumable and then we go into the full kind of set for this year that gets into the discretionary. And we'll get to like 15% penetration in the store in terms of the multi-price penetration in the store. And then, John, on share gain, I mean, we're growing. Our unit market is growing. Our dollar market's growing. We are taking share in a belt-tightening environment, but we continue to be incredibly relevant to the customer. And I would say, we continue to be needed by the customer as they adapt to the macro conditions. And then in terms of where this could go, you have a steady rollout. We continue to learn from the rollout, and a big part of why we're behind 200 stores on the rollout was we simply won't convert a store that's not ready to convert. It's something we learned from the early rollout. There was this tendency to kind of, hey, we can muscle through this. And when we saw, remember, Rick talked about 50% absolutely, 25% are in line and 25% are behind. In order to try to influence that, we changed our process to say, we're not going to muscle through, we're going to make sure a store is ready to convert and ready to realize the full potential of the multi-price when we execute it. And we'll continue to learn from the rollout and make changes as we go.\nJeff Davis: And then, John, on the Family Dollar side, while the consumable comp did flatten out a little bit, I would say, in contrast, on the discretionary side, we also saw some flattening out of the decline in discretionary, continue to see the resets that we're doing in that particular area where we're focusing on expandable consumption at price points that is very attractive for the customer, given their needs is starting to resonate for us. And these comps, once again, are on top of last year some of the highest comps that we had for the last year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Thanks. Good morning. On the stores that have been converted, Jeff and Mike, can you unpack that 4.6% comp lift between traffic and ticket? And then can you also talk about the four-wall profitability of those stores as you've progressed on the rollout? If you pull out the SG&A dollar growth for the entire Dollar Tree banner, ex the general liability, is up 10% year-to-date. Curious how the four-wall profits are looking with the higher cost to roll that multi-price point effort out. Thank you.\nJeff Davis: Yeah. So, great questions there, Chuck. If I unpack some of these, as it relates to the stores that have converted, and you mentioned the 4.6% comp there, we haven't given the detail between traffic and ticket. As we look at it, overall, it's really being driven by traffic. Ticket here right now is flat at best with the Dollar Tree and it is, in those particular stores also, ticket, if you can imagine the, when you have a multi-price item in the basket, you also still have a number of $1.25 items and it's the increased traffic that's coming in, that basket is staying relatively flat overall, but we're really being driven by traffic. As it relates to the SG&A, I think you very appropriately pointed out. The headwinds in SG&A, other than the general liability, has been as a result of the, what we call, other payrolls, that third-party labor that we're using to implement the stores. We're going to have that this year. We'll have it next year. We had called it out previously as a headwind of $0.20 plus this year as a headwind to our overall EPS. The other area that's impacting our SG&A is absolutely on the depreciation side. And it's the cumulative investments that we've been making, not only in new stores, but in other initiatives as it relates to supply chain and IT. Those investments are starting to level off as we've gone that much further in the overall transformation. And as we move forward, we'll be giving you other estimates as we look forward to subsequent years. But we're not updating any forecast at this point in time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey, thanks, guys. On the macro pressures that you cited, Dollar Tree's middle, higher-income consumers, do you think that customer is shopping less overall or you think they're going somewhere else? And I wondering if you think you need to change anything on the pricing side or how fast you roll out multi-price. And then, second, I'm curious if you can talk about whether you're taking any actions behind the scenes to separate aspects of the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar business that might have some sort of P&L impact or if you plan to do that over the course of the year as you think about the strategic review of Family Dollar? Thanks.\nMike Creedon: Yeah, Paul, I'll take the first one and I'll let Jeff tackle the separation of business. So, this is macro belt tightening. I mean, we see it, we see we're growing traffic. We see the 2.8 million new customers we've added. We hear the feedback on multi-price and that they love that they can get more, we get more share of their wallet, they can, not have to drive somewhere else to fill in the shop. But they're really changing, as you look at some of the discretionary, in Q2, we saw some changes in terms of how they celebrate. And that is just belt tightening by our consumer and one that we feel they need us more now than ever. And so, we'll be there to help them celebrate as they do need the discretionary and go back to a little more celebration and invite more people to a party and doing all the things that really the kind of the holidays demand. Jeff?\nJeff Davis: Yeah. Just to add to that, one of the things that we do, we try and double-click on a number of different things that we're seeing from our overall customer base based on customer insights. And we continue to see customers buy more, so they're expanding their consumption, and we see individuals who are contracting their spend. Right now, because of this macro belt tightening, you see more people contracting than actually expanding. But that is more the issue, as Mike said, it's belt tightening. It's not, from a competitive standpoint, those individuals net shopping elsewhere. As it relates to Family Dollar and the strategic review, we continue to operate both businesses with the intent of continuing to maximize shareholder value in order to grow both. As we had mentioned earlier, even last quarter, we had decided that we were going to shift some of the investments as it relates to new store openings and some of the renovations, tilting a little more towards Dollar Tree versus Family Dollar. But other than that, we continue to operate the two businesses with the expectation that, once again, we are bullish on both. The question probably didn't go this far, but I think it's probably easiest to address this at this point in time on the strategic review. We are looking at a wide range of operations, including those that would include outside parties and those that would, we should be able to execute by ourselves. And we're very pleased at the progress we're making on that strategic review at this point in time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nKrisztina Katai: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Jeff, I wanted to ask if this challenged consumer backdrop that we've been seeing is changing the way that you view if any incremental investments might be needed in the business, just thinking about the overall value engineering, labor, store standards? And as you see the belt tightening, as you noted, just how do you think about core Dollar Tree's value proposition and how do you see the evolution in the back half, just given peers' greater markdown activity? Thank you.\nJeff Davis: Yes, Krisztina. As we think about this, we want to manage the business for the long-term. And these are different, in this period of time, where we're seeing some belt tightening, doesn't mean that this is not, this has an impact on the, this sector of this business longer term. The investments that we're making around store standards, the investments that we're making with respect to our rollout of the multi-price, we believe is all core to providing a great experience for the customer, a convenient opportunity and delivering value. So we feel as if, as we work through this, we have a, we're mindful of what the current macroeconomic environment is, but we also understand that we need to remain true to our transformation and how this will deliver value over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, everyone. So, you guys took some tougher medicine at Family Dollar over the last couple of quarters. And it seems like the profit performance at Family Dollar actually has started to improve a bit once you get through the adjustments. But Dollar Tree seems to keep suffering from additional issues and expenses quarter-after-quarter. Would it make sense to do a harder reset at Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree expectations, whether that's through store closures, fully or permanently resetting labor costs, et cetera. Because I think investors tend to despise the death of a thousand cuts. Thanks.\nJeff Davis: I think the best way we think about this is, this quarter, we saw a pullback in a higher-income customer. We believe that we are positioned appropriately to meet that customer's needs over time as they're looking for value. We believe our multi-price offering is what's going to give us that support. The investments that we're making as it relates to, once again, store standards and other things that we're doing is part and parcel to making sure that we deliver the experience that the higher-income customer is looking for. We will continue to be diligent and disciplined as we think about those investments on a go-forward basis, but we believe that it is in line with what we need to deliver over the long-term.\nMike Creedon: Yeah. And as I look at just the new stores we opened, the renovations we're doing, and then when you talk about more than 3,000 stores that we'll touch this year, that is an investment in our store standards. That is making our stores better for our customers. And so we look and we like what that future looks like. We like the ability to kind of touch the chain every year and get back on a track of really showing our customer that we care by bringing in new things that excite them, new things that wow them, and really true to who Dollar Tree is. So, I mean, I look at it and say, our customer needs our business more than ever and we're continuing to evolve the business to meet them where they are.\nJeff Davis: And the last thing I'll add is, if you think about the 99 Cents store acquisition that we did of leases, yes, we've had some higher-than-expected upfront costs, but we are really excited about these 161 stores that we've been able to acquire. They're in the markets that we believe we need to be in at very attractive overall lease rates. We believe that we have the credibility and latitude to grow very aggressively in these particular areas. These stores are of the size and scale that other stores that we've had in this type of situation have been able to outperform against the broader portfolio. So while there's some short-term pain here as we kind of work through this. We'll be very excited about what this is going to deliver for us once again over the long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to management for any closing comments.\nMike Creedon: Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning, and thank you for all our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar associates out there serving our customers and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Jeff Davis",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning. I'll start off by discussing our second quarter results, after which I'll provide some comments on our third quarter and fiscal 2024 outlook. Where applicable, I will focus on our adjusted results. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in our earnings release. Second quarter results obviously fell short of our expectations. Our adjusted EPS of $0.67 was $0.38 below the midpoint of our June outlook. Of that $0.38, $0.30 was attributable to the general liability adjustment, while the remaining $0.08 was attributable to the flow-through from the sales shortfall, mostly in the Dollar Tree segment. As Mike indicated, Dollar Tree's comp softness was primarily on the discretionary side of the business and reflected the increasing effect of macro pressures on the purchasing behavior of the Dollar Tree's middle and higher income-customers. Our original second quarter outlook did not anticipate those pressures migrating to Dollar Tree's customer base to the degree that they did. Turning to the business results on a consolidated basis. Adjusted operating income was $218 million, a 24% decrease from last year. Adjusted operating margin decreased by approximately 90 basis points to 3%, reflecting an 80 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 180 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin improvement came primarily from lower freight costs, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and higher occupancy costs. Adjusted SG&A increased primarily from the general liability adjustment, higher depreciation, temporary labor for Dollar Tree's multi-price rollout, higher utility costs, and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower incentive comp cost. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.2%, compared to 24%. Adjusted net income was $143 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67. Let me take a step back and offer additional details around the general liability adjustment we made in the quarter. As we stated before, predicting the outcome of both existing and unreported claims is inherently complex, particularly as general liability claims have become more volatile in recent years. Due to the increase in estimated liabilities for these claims, we took an incremental $84 million charge or $0.30 of EPS against our prior outlook, with about $0.21 of that pertaining to Dollar Tree and the balance to Family Dollar. So, what's going on here and why are we talking about this again. Given the size and scale of our footprint, we managed thousands of general liability claims stemming from customer accidents and other incidents at our stores and surrounding areas. While some claims are current, many relate to prior years. Overtime, the ultimate outcome of claims particularly older claims during the pandemic and post-pandemic time frame has become increasingly challenged to predict given the higher settlement and litigation costs that have resulted from a more volatile insurance environment. For these reasons, twice a year, we rely on third-party actuarial assessments and assumptions to evaluate accruals for open claims, as well as incurred but not yet reported claims. The claims have continued to develop unfavorably due to the rising cost to reimburse, settle and litigate these claims, which impacted our actuarily determined liabilities. While exposure to general liability claims remain difficult to forecast, we believe the adjustment we took in Q2 captures the current range of potential outcomes, based on what we have experienced in recent years. Now, let's move on to our business segment results. At Dollar Tree, adjusted operating income decreased 13% to $344 million. Adjusted operating margin decreased 190 basis points, driven by a 80 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 270 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin improved primarily from lower freight costs. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and occupancy cost. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily due to the general liability adjustment, higher depreciation, temporary labor for the multi-price rollout, higher utility costs, and sales deleverage. At Family Dollar, adjusted operating loss was $3.6 million, compared to adjusted operating income of $11.8 million last year. Adjusted operating margin decreased 40 basis points on a 50 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 100 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin increased primarily from lower freight and occupancy costs, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix, higher distribution costs, and markdowns. Adjusted SG&A rate increased primarily from higher depreciation and amortization, the general liability charge, and sales deleverage. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory decreased by 4% or $228 million. Average inventory per store decreased 3.6%. On a related note, to-date, we have received $70.8 million of insurance proceeds related to the inventory loss and property damage at our Marietta, Oklahoma DC. We expect the remaining $46 million of outstanding losses will be fully recovered under our existing insurance policies in due course. With cash and cash equivalents of $570 million and long-term debt of $3.4 billion, our balance sheet remains strong. Our bank-defined leverage at quarter-end stood at approximately 2.5 times, which continues to underpin our investment-grade creditworthiness. On the cash flow statement, we generated $307 million from operating activities, compared to $172 million last year. Capital expenditures were $501 million in the quarter versus $425 million last year, reflecting the accelerated new store openings and ongoing investments in growth and other initiatives. Our free cash flow in the quarter improved $60 million over last year. Consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation after investing in the growth of our business this quarter, we returned $91 million to our shareholders by repurchasing 750,000 shares at an average price of $120 per share. At quarter-end, we had approximately $952 million remaining under our existing share repurchase program. Now, let me provide some perspective on our third quarter and full year expectations. Our current revised outlook reflects the following. We are taking a more conservative view towards comp sales in the back half of the year, particularly in the Dollar Tree segment, as macro factors continue to weigh on customer sentiment and adversely affect discretionary demand and buying behavior. It also reflects one-time integration costs related to the 99 Cents Only lease acquisitions, because time was of the essence in acquiring these leases and in a competitive bidding process, the time between when we took physical possession of these properties and when we and when they opened was longer than expected. As a result, we are incurring upfront occupancy costs like rent, insurance and security for an extended period before the stores open. We announced this transaction a week before or prior to our last earnings call and these additional upfront costs were not anticipated in the outlook we gave at that time. All-in, we estimate these incremental upfront costs will negatively impact third quarter EPS by approximately $0.07 and fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.05. On a positive note , the initial sales performance of the converted and reopened stores is exceeding our initial expectations and we are increasingly bullish regarding the long-term prospect for this portfolio. We are also expecting higher D&A expense in the back half of the year after reforecasting our capital projects to reflect higher anticipated costs for projects, such as new stores, renovations, and our IT transformation, as well as the timing of receipt for vendor invoices. This is expected to be an incremental EPS headwind of approximately $0.12, split evenly between Q3 and Q4. On the positive side of the ledger, we saw some green shoots in discretionary mix at Family Dollar in Q2, which is so far carried into Q3. We are assuming this trend continues for the balance of the year and are now expecting a modest mix headwind for Family Dollar in the back half. The better initial performance at the converted 99 Cents Only stores is also reflected in our revised sales outlook. From a modeling perspective, it's also worth reminding everyone that sales from these and all new stores won't show up in our comp store net sales until after they've been open for 15 months. And finally, payroll should come in lower than previously forecast as we align incentive comp and hours with our revised business outlook. With that background, for the third quarter, we expect net sales will be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, based on low-single digit comp net sales growth for the enterprise and both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Adjusting for the stores that were closed as part of the portfolio optimization, we expect third quarter net sales for the Family Dollar segment to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. We expect adjusted EPS will be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15, which reflects a more conservative sales outlook, the incremental upfront cost of the 99 Cents Only stores, and the D&A reforecast. For the full year, we expect net sales to be in the range of $30.6 billion to $30.9 billion, based on low-single digit comp net sales growth for the enterprise and both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Adjusting for stores closed as part of the portfolio optimization in the extra week in fiscal 2023, we expect full year net sales for Family Dollar to decline by 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.60, reflecting our second quarter results, our revised sales forecast, the 99 Cents Only cost, and D&A. In the interest of time, I will direct you to our supplemental financial presentation, which is available on our IR website, for the remaining details that support our current outlook. So, to recap, we're revising the midpoint of our full year 2024 outlook from $5.40 from $6.75. Of that $1.35 delta, $0.38 came from Q2 shortfall, the vast majority of which came from the general liability adjustment. Then in the back half of the year, $0.12 is from the higher upfront cost in the 99 Cents Only portfolio. Another $0.12 is from the D&A adjustment and the remaining $0.73 is primarily from the flow-through on the lowered sales outlook, which is mostly due to our more conservative outlook for discretionary sales at Dollar Tree. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Yeah. Good morning, Michael. This is Jeff. I'll take a portion of that question regarding general liability and some of the other elements. You point out, I think, a very valid point. The general liability adjustments we had to take is one that we're not happy with. It's one in which, as I had mentioned in my remarks, it is very complex as a result of how these claims develop over time and having new information around that. We believe that the adjustment that we've taken today reflects not only that historic performance, our current outcomes as it relates to how these claims are developing, but we're also making sure that we're not anticipating any improvement in these claims experience on a go-forward basis. Thus, we feel more confident around the adjustment that we've taken reflects the current liability that is sitting out there for, once again, not only these existing claims, but the claims that have yet to be reported. That's the best way I can respond to that to you to Michael, that we believe we now have this behind us. The second portion of your question, I believe, was around where do we think the operating margins of the long-term operating margins of the business would be. As we continue to drive multi-price and we're going to continue to drive higher gross profit dollars per transaction, we believe that as we move forward and we get beyond some of the higher transformation costs that we're experiencing right now as it relates to some of the IT investments that we're making, supply chain investments, that we'll be able to achieve the outlook that we had provided previously on the longer-term basis for the business. I don't want to give any longer-term view of the business other than what we've already given. In our outlook for the quarter, we said that, once again, Family Dollar, I'm sorry, Dollar Tree is going to be low-single-digits. We said that the, one second here, in our financial let's see if I can find it real quick. Yeah, I found it here, Michael. I just want to make sure that I quoted this appropriately. As it relates to 2024 outlook, we still believe that the gross margins on the Dollar Tree business will be in the range of 36% and the flow-throughs that we've had previously, we said on a consolidated basis, the SG&A will be approximately 26% and the SG&A outlook on the Dollar Tree segment already reflects the additional costs that we've had as it relates to the approximately 2,800 stores that we're going to convert to multi-price. That's the other headwind that we have currently in the business as we're using third-party labor for that. Yeah. Just a couple of things to add to that. If you think about the Dollar Tree segment, last year this time, we added over 2 million new customers. We're now lapping that. We continue to add beyond that. So it is absolutely resonating with the customer. If you think about the fact that we continue to maintain our market share in this environment at a time when we're actually seeing customers contract their spend, it's not that we are seeing, it's a combination of things. So we're seeing contraction of spend. We're not seeing necessarily a loss from a competitive standpoint. So we continue to add new customers, maintain market share, continue to resonate with the customer when Mike had spoken about the new in-line conversion stores, that multi-price delivering 6%-plus comps in consumables and even positive almost a 3% comp in discretionary. So very, very favorable for us. As it relates to Family Dollar, we're excited about what we're seeing in Family Dollar also. From a standpoint of we're starting to actually see some discretionary improvement, we believe we're beyond the biggest headwinds that we've had with respect to the customer with SNAP. We're continuing to see improvement in shrink. We've invested in people time, technology and systems on the Family Dollar side and this proof points are really starting to deliver and improve shrink results there. The customer is resonating with a number of the resets that we've had. It's just that customer right now is under some of the more significant budget pressures and they're working through it. And when we're seeing that customer use all tenders, not only that may be government assistance, but also using credit where it makes sense. And then, John, on the Family Dollar side, while the consumable comp did flatten out a little bit, I would say, in contrast, on the discretionary side, we also saw some flattening out of the decline in discretionary, continue to see the resets that we're doing in that particular area where we're focusing on expandable consumption at price points that is very attractive for the customer, given their needs is starting to resonate for us. And these comps, once again, are on top of last year some of the highest comps that we had for the last year. Yeah. So, great questions there, Chuck. If I unpack some of these, as it relates to the stores that have converted, and you mentioned the 4.6% comp there, we haven't given the detail between traffic and ticket. As we look at it, overall, it's really being driven by traffic. Ticket here right now is flat at best with the Dollar Tree and it is, in those particular stores also, ticket, if you can imagine the, when you have a multi-price item in the basket, you also still have a number of $1.25 items and it's the increased traffic that's coming in, that basket is staying relatively flat overall, but we're really being driven by traffic. As it relates to the SG&A, I think you very appropriately pointed out. The headwinds in SG&A, other than the general liability, has been as a result of the, what we call, other payrolls, that third-party labor that we're using to implement the stores. We're going to have that this year. We'll have it next year. We had called it out previously as a headwind of $0.20 plus this year as a headwind to our overall EPS. The other area that's impacting our SG&A is absolutely on the depreciation side. And it's the cumulative investments that we've been making, not only in new stores, but in other initiatives as it relates to supply chain and IT. Those investments are starting to level off as we've gone that much further in the overall transformation. And as we move forward, we'll be giving you other estimates as we look forward to subsequent years. But we're not updating any forecast at this point in time. Yeah. Just to add to that, one of the things that we do, we try and double-click on a number of different things that we're seeing from our overall customer base based on customer insights. And we continue to see customers buy more, so they're expanding their consumption, and we see individuals who are contracting their spend. Right now, because of this macro belt tightening, you see more people contracting than actually expanding. But that is more the issue, as Mike said, it's belt tightening. It's not, from a competitive standpoint, those individuals net shopping elsewhere. As it relates to Family Dollar and the strategic review, we continue to operate both businesses with the intent of continuing to maximize shareholder value in order to grow both. As we had mentioned earlier, even last quarter, we had decided that we were going to shift some of the investments as it relates to new store openings and some of the renovations, tilting a little more towards Dollar Tree versus Family Dollar. But other than that, we continue to operate the two businesses with the expectation that, once again, we are bullish on both. The question probably didn't go this far, but I think it's probably easiest to address this at this point in time on the strategic review. We are looking at a wide range of operations, including those that would include outside parties and those that would, we should be able to execute by ourselves. And we're very pleased at the progress we're making on that strategic review at this point in time. Yes, Krisztina. As we think about this, we want to manage the business for the long-term. And these are different, in this period of time, where we're seeing some belt tightening, doesn't mean that this is not, this has an impact on the, this sector of this business longer term. The investments that we're making around store standards, the investments that we're making with respect to our rollout of the multi-price, we believe is all core to providing a great experience for the customer, a convenient opportunity and delivering value. So we feel as if, as we work through this, we have a, we're mindful of what the current macroeconomic environment is, but we also understand that we need to remain true to our transformation and how this will deliver value over time. I think the best way we think about this is, this quarter, we saw a pullback in a higher-income customer. We believe that we are positioned appropriately to meet that customer's needs over time as they're looking for value. We believe our multi-price offering is what's going to give us that support. The investments that we're making as it relates to, once again, store standards and other things that we're doing is part and parcel to making sure that we deliver the experience that the higher-income customer is looking for. We will continue to be diligent and disciplined as we think about those investments on a go-forward basis, but we believe that it is in line with what we need to deliver over the long-term. And the last thing I'll add is, if you think about the 99 Cents store acquisition that we did of leases, yes, we've had some higher-than-expected upfront costs, but we are really excited about these 161 stores that we've been able to acquire. They're in the markets that we believe we need to be in at very attractive overall lease rates. We believe that we have the credibility and latitude to grow very aggressively in these particular areas. These stores are of the size and scale that other stores that we've had in this type of situation have been able to outperform against the broader portfolio. So while there's some short-term pain here as we kind of work through this. We'll be very excited about what this is going to deliver for us once again over the long-term."

            "name": "Mike Creedon",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Creedon. I'm Dollar Tree's Chief Operating Officer and I'm happy to pinch-hit for Rick this morning. When Rick first joined Dollar Tree as Executive Chairman and again last year when he became CEO, he told you that he came here to lead a transformation with the primary goal of helping this company realize its full potential. He's also said that transformations are rarely easy or linear and that is especially true for a company as large as ours that is navigating through one of the most challenging macro environments we've ever seen. That said Rick and all of us on the senior leadership team believe very deeply in this transformation and the positive impact we're having in the areas we control. We also believe very deeply in the importance of providing the high-quality, low-cost products that individuals and families need in a convenient and comfortable shopping environment. We are also committed to serving the communities where we operate. And most importantly, we are aware of the awesome responsibility we have each and every day to serve our customers, associates and shareholders. Clearly, we are not pleased with our second quarter results or having to revise our full year outlook. But this updated outlook reflects how the challenging macro environment continues to pressure our customers. It also reflects some revised financial estimates that we will discuss shortly. That said, we will also talk about several areas where we are performing well and where our transformation initiatives are taking hold. And I will share where we are heading as a company and why we are still so excited about our future. So, let's get started. Sales came in towards the low end of our outlook range. Family Dollar's comp was in line, but Dollar Tree's comp, while positive, was lower than we expected. As we have seen for several quarters now, demand from Family Dollar's core lower-income customer remains weak. Dollar Tree has a broader customer base that includes more middle and upper-income households. And beginning this quarter, we started to see inflation, interest rates and other macro pressures have a more pronounced impact on the buying behavior of these customers. This impacted our second quarter comp performance and is the primary driver of our revised full year outlook. Despite these near-term pressures, we are confident in the Dollar Tree segment's ability to compete and win. Our offerings provide customers with exceptional values that are well matched to the current environment. We are strong believers in the inherent strength of Dollar Tree's differentiated business model and its long-term strategy of multi-price expansion and store growth acceleration. Today, we need to be sensitive and responsive to the needs of our customers and meet them where they are and how they are living. In this environment, retailers who can offer products to provide value and convenience to pressured consumers are the ones who will take market share and grow sales. We believe we are and will continue to be one of those winning retailers. Before getting into the rest of the details on the second quarter, let us acknowledge that Dollar Tree's comp store performance was just part of the lower-than-expected Q2 earnings. The most significant component, $0.30 of EPS that wasn't in our June outlook, was related to general liability claims. Predicting these claims is complex and we again increased our accrual for general liability this quarter after observing higher-than-expected costs to resolve certain claims. Jeff will give you the full details on this in a few minutes. Again, in this evolving economic backdrop, our team remains focused on factors that are within our control, including the rollout of key transformation initiatives. Dollar Tree's multi-price expansion continues to resonate with our customers and the 1,600 stores that have been converted into our newest in-line format are seeing an outsized sales lift. As we talked about last quarter, we are building new muscle memory with multi-price. This rollout is a process and we are constantly making adjustments based on our learnings from earlier rounds of conversions. For example, we are now prioritizing ready-to-convert stores and moving them to the front of the line, ahead of stores that may need some additional prep work before they can realize the full range of conversion benefits. As we've taken the time to incorporate these learnings, we're a few 100 stores behind our original schedule, but we've learned that it's better to get the conversions done right than to rush the process. The most important thing is that the customer response is validating our strategy, because our biggest challenge now is keeping up with the demand for the new assortment. To give you a sense of how these stores are performing, comps for the 1,600 stores we've converted were up 4.6% in the second quarter versus less than 0.5% at our other formats. Our Q1 conversions, who had the benefit of the new multi-price format and assortment for all of Q2, did a 5.1% comp. Importantly, these in-line stores showed strength across the assortment with a 6.7% consumables comp and a 2.6% discretionary comp. Considering the vast majority of our new discretionary multi-price items won't be in these stores until later this year, we are very pleased with these early results. We also believe that, over time, our expanded discretionary multi-price offerings will help us overcome some of the macro-driven weakness we're seeing elsewhere in the portfolio. We believe the expansion of in-line multi-price across the Dollar Tree portfolio will be a major growth driver for many years to come. Today, less than 15% of our SKUs are multi-price. In addition to driving comp, the higher gross profit dollars per item generated by this assortment should provide a meaningful lift to store economics over time. As excited as we are about these initial results, we believe we are still in the very early innings with many years of runway ahead of us. We're also happy to announce that as of today, we've reopened approximately 85 former 99 Cents Only locations as Dollar Trees. In fact, another 20 stores are reopening tomorrow and the remaining 56 should reopen by the end of the year. Getting this done from scratch in less than 100 days required a massive effort across multiple teams. That's a real accomplishment. I would like to thank everyone involved for all their hard work. These 99 Cents Only locations are proven, high-quality stores in strong markets with great growth potential. We're very excited about expanding our footprint across California and the Southwest and we couldn't be more pleased with the reception we've received from the communities who've welcomed us. This transaction was a rare opportunity to acquire a portfolio of assets under very favorable lease terms. We expect these stores will provide compelling unit-level economics and positive synergies across our network. While we have to absorb some unanticipated upfront costs that Jeff will talk about in a minute, this is still a great deal. In supply chain, our DC in West Memphis, Arkansas, has reopened and is now making deliveries. Recall that after we lost our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma, we decided to temporarily repurpose West Memphis to support the Dollar Tree banner. We're also making good progress on RotaCarts. West Memphis is servicing over 600 Dollar Tree and combo stores with RotaCarts, and by next year, it will be able to handle an additional 150 stores. Elsewhere, our DC in Matthews, North Carolina is delivering to Family Dollar Stars with RotaCarts and we're serving approximately 300 Dollar Tree stores with RotaCarts out of our DC here in Chesapeake, Virginia. By the end of the year, four DCs should be providing RotaCart deliveries to over 2,000 stores. We're collecting lots of data from initial deployments and refining our rollout plans based on what we learn along the way. In IT, Bobby Aflatooni and his team are making great progress across our modernization initiatives. Our new warehouse management system went live at its first two DCs, with two more slated for early next year. Across both banners, we've transitioned over 9,000 stores to our network infrastructure, which supports business operations by improving Internet connectivity, security and in-store Wi-Fi access for associates. Additionally, we've created an entirely new infrastructure to support the multi-price rollout, including shelf tag label printers, in-store price checkers, and back office functionality. Our Family Dollar Private Brands program continues to gain momentum. Private Brands contributed 16% of consumable sales in the quarter, which puts us well ahead of schedule to hit our 70% year-end target. Year-to-date, we've added 75 new SKUs across food, HBA, and household products and Private Brands now represent 9% of Family Dollar SKUs. Among categories, we're seeing strong growth in food and we see great potential in HBA, where we remain under-indexed. Shrink remains a major topic across retail. While shrink remains unacceptably high, it appears to be stabilizing. While it is too early to declare victory, I am pleased that our targeted actions and interventions helped our second quarter shrink rate. We are running ahead of shrink expectations at Family Dollar and still have some additional work to do at Dollar Tree as we adjust to the new shrink challenges that arise when we introduce more high-value, multi-price products into the assortment. Now, let's move to the financial highlights from the quarter. On a consolidated basis, net sales increased 0.7% to $7.4 billion. Enterprise comp increased 0.7% on a 1.1% traffic increase, partially offset by a 0.5% average ticket decline. Looking at performance by banner, Dollar Tree comps increased 1.3% on a 1.4% traffic increase, modestly offset by a 0.1% average ticket decline. While comps were positive in each month, they softened sequentially throughout the quarter. While discretionary products remain an integral part of Dollar Tree's retail mission. Our sales mix has shifted towards consumables in recent years. For example, Dollar Tree's consumable mix increased 210 basis points in the second quarter to 50.6%. Part of this shift reflects softer discretionary demand, but part of it is tied to some timing differences in our latest multi-price rollout. Given their shorter lead times, many of the earliest items we introduced were consumables. In the back half of the year, our discretionary mix should improve as more longer lead time discretionary items, particularly in seasonal, finally arrive in our stores. Dollar Tree's consumable comp was 4.7% against a very challenging 13.2% comp last year. While discretionary comp was down 1.9% on the unfavorable mix, this was a sequential improvement from the Easter-related challenges we faced in Q1. Consumable categories like candy, apparel, snacks and beverages were our best performing areas in Q2, while higher-margin discretionary categories like crafts, floral, and home decor underperformed. After several quarters of strong growth, Dollar Tree's unit and dollar market share gains moderated in the second quarter. Dollar Tree attracted 2.8 million net new shoppers over the past 12 months. In the Family Dollar segment, customer traffic and average ticket largely offset as comps declined 0.1%. Comps were positive in the middle month of the quarter and negative in the first and last months. Customer traffic increased 0.7%, while average decreased traffic, 0.8%. Our consumables comp increased 0.3% on top of a strong 9.5% comp in Q2 last year. Discretionary comp declined 1.7%, a 300 basis point sequential improvement over Q1. The improving trend in discretionary comp reflects recent efforts to improve our assortment by emphasizing more relevant items with higher purchase frequency. Standouts for best performing categories were evenly split across discretionary and consumables, including beverages, apparel, health OTC, and personal care. Meanwhile, bottom-performing categories like home decor, seasonal, and beauty skewed towards discretionary. Family Dollar's unit and market share were essentially flat in the quarter. Family Dollar attracted 1.8 million net new shoppers over the past 12 months. Let's also update you on SNAP benefits. As you may know, over 40% of Family Dollar customers are eligible for some form of government assistance, including SNAP, and those benefits are a meaningful part of their household resources. We have cycled most of last year's benefit reductions and we believe the worst is now behind us. In the second quarter, reduced SNAP benefits were a 60 basis point comp headwind for Family Dollar, significantly better than the 280 basis-point impact we saw in Q1 and the 500 basis point impact in Q4 of last year. And one last point to share on SNAP, Family Dollar customers can now buy SNAP eligible products online through Instacart delivery. This collaboration reduces transportation dependency by giving customers access to same day delivery of Family Dollar products. This is a logical extension of our mission to help individuals and families do more with less by making essential goods more affordable and accessible. Now, let us share some thoughts on a few other top-of-mind issues. We know that tariffs have been a big topic recently. In the event of any meaningful change to the current tariff regime, we have long-standing contingency plans to diversify our supply chain in a timely and cost-effective manner. We also have the flexibility to adjust product specs and price points to address any changes in the market. Regarding ocean freight, our exposure to spot rates remains limited as the vast majority of our capacity is covered by annual or long-term contracts. With limited near-term exposure to container rate volatility, our outlook for ocean and domestic freight remains positive. Regarding changes to overtime thresholds for salary workers under the Fair Labor Standards Act, we fully absorbed the first phase of this in early July. The next proposed phase, which raises the July salary threshold by an additional 34%, is scheduled to go into effect on January 1st of next year. However, there is significant uncertainty over when and if this change will be implemented. We are evaluating multiple mitigation strategies to address the proposed rules. And finally, we wanted to provide an update and let you know what we are making good progress on our strategic review at Family Dollar, which includes evaluating a full range of pathways to maximize shareholder value. As we discussed in June, our transformation includes operational and business improvements, such as multi-price at Dollar Tree, as well as this more holistic evaluation of the best structure and pathway for our Family Dollar business. We understand that there are many questions on this topic and we reiterate our commitment to update you when we reach the conclusion of the review. The actions we took earlier this year at Family Dollar to close underperforming stores are having the intended impact, and our remaining Family Dollar stores are focused on providing service and value to our customers across the country each and every day. Before wrapping up, we'd like to share a few thoughts about our revised outlook. We've adjusted our sales outlook to better reflect where the consumer is today as they continue to adapt to the evolving macro landscape. Regarding the 99 Cents Only portfolio, our revised outlook reflects a better estimate of the one-time pre-opening costs associated with these stores and better than what we had when the transaction first closed. Finally, it is also the adjustment to our general liability exposure and our latest D&A forecast, which Jeff will discuss in a moment. We are comfortable with this reset, given where the customer and the business are today, and we are confident in our ability to execute against our objectives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Thanks, Jeff. On behalf of Rick and the entire senior management team, I want to thank our teams for their continued hard work in a very challenging macro environment and for supporting our strategic review of Family Dollar. Our strategic review is looking at the full range of alternatives for Family Dollar with a focus on clearly demonstrating the full value of our two distinct franchises. Despite significant headwinds, our Dollar Tree banners comp remains positive even as they lap two years of extremely strong performance. Our non-multi-price stores were modestly positive this quarter and our newly converted multi-price stores produced a 4.6% comp. This is one of the best multi-year comp performances in all of retail. Most importantly, we have just begun to roll out our expanded multi-price SKUs and we still have thousands of stores to convert to our new format. On top of that, we're opening hundreds of brand new in-line multi-price stores this year and plan to do so for many years to come. In light of all this, we continue to believe that Dollar Tree is one of the strongest platforms in all of retail with many years of strong comp and store growth still ahead of us. Operator, with that, Jeff and I are ready to take questions. And while Jeff's doing that, Michael, the mix we see too on the multi-price, remember, it comes in heavy consumable first because that's what we could get in the short order. As you look to enter the back half of the year with the holidays, you get that discretionary benefit from the multi-price rollout. Yeah, and it's Mike. I'll take the first one. We said we're still in the early innings of multi-price and I'll tell you that we like what the customer is telling us with multi-price. So we're surveying our customers, we're listening to them. They're telling us with their comps. I highlighted how strong our multi-price stores are performing compared to stores that just have the $1.25. And we're really growing traffic. We're adding new customers and our customers are letting us know that they like the product. And then when you look to the second half, we really think they're going to like the discretionary product. So we've seen it as our stores have set. Our associates are our customers and our associates are telling us they love this multi-price product. They're excited about the holiday season and all that. So we'll continue to learn as we go. We've made changes. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're a couple of hundred stores behind where we are. That's because we want to be better. We want to get it right when we roll them out. And so, we took the approach. We added some, call it, milestones or stop gates to say, we're not going to convert a store unless that store is ready to be converted, so we can improve what the customer sees when they come in and the overall performance of the multi-price stores. And then, Jeff, I'll let you talk to the FD strategic. Sure, Simeon. So there's two pieces to this. One is the bandwidth of our own internal team to get these stores done with both the new store openings we're doing, renovations we're doing, and the multi-price rollout. That's why we really leaned on third-party to take off as much as we could and go as quickly as we could. The other gating process is, as we turn our distribution network on with multi-price that then feeds the stores that we convert. So there is a little bit of a gating factor in terms of the product coming in, the DC being set for multi-price and being able to service those stores. So we'll do when you look at it, we set a couple of hundred behind this year. So instead of 3,000, that's 2,800 or more. But then there's another 300 new stores that open up multi-price as well. And you'll see a similar cadence each year as we go through to all stores that we can put multi-price in. So it's really a question of our own bandwidth to process it and then our ability to work with vendors to get it into our DCs and get it out to the stores. I'll tell you, Simeon, when we do the execution right, the only challenge we have is keeping up with the product, because the customers love it. Sure, Matt. Good morning. So, first, in terms of the trends, I think it's a little bit of the, I call it, the who, the how, and the what. The who is the income level. While we saw in Family Dollar early that the low-income pressured shopper, we saw that drift up and materially drift up in the second quarter as the middle income, the greater than $125,000, that person started feeling the pressure as well from the macro environment. And then the how, they shifted to buying for need versus buying for want. And so really that showed in our discretionary mix, leaning towards consumables. And then finally, the what. This started with sensitivity on big ticket items and has come all the way now to us as people have maybe changed how they celebrate a party this summer, fewer guests, fewer parties. They're really tightening their belts and the macro economy is driving them to behave a bit differently. And so when we look at all those things together, that really pressured us. As you look then at how we exit and where we go, I'll tell you, Q2 is always one of those quarters where there's really no holiday. All you have is 4th of July, whereas Q3, we get back to school and Halloween. And then when you look at Q4, you get that harvest, you get Christmas, and really that demands you go to Dollar Tree. It's we help people celebrate their lives and so that gets our people coming in. So those were the trends. And as we look out, I think, Jeff would say, our current trends reflect our overall forecast right now. And then finally, on the core doors, I mean, I would tell you, I still think, yes, they were in that 0.5%. But you look at some of the two-year stacks, when you really look at the multi-year performance of these stores, I think, it's some of the best in retail. And as we roll out the multi-price, we really feed that thrill of the hunt and we get it to more doors. They come in for the thrill of the hunt on the multi-price and we get to sell the rest of the store. So I really think we end up getting that boost to the core from the rest from the rollout of multi-price. Yeah. So, to the first one, as we roll out the 1,600, right now, you get that mix, where early on, it's consumable and then we go into the full kind of set for this year that gets into the discretionary. And we'll get to like 15% penetration in the store in terms of the multi-price penetration in the store. And then, John, on share gain, I mean, we're growing. Our unit market is growing. Our dollar market's growing. We are taking share in a belt-tightening environment, but we continue to be incredibly relevant to the customer. And I would say, we continue to be needed by the customer as they adapt to the macro conditions. And then in terms of where this could go, you have a steady rollout. We continue to learn from the rollout, and a big part of why we're behind 200 stores on the rollout was we simply won't convert a store that's not ready to convert. It's something we learned from the early rollout. There was this tendency to kind of, hey, we can muscle through this. And when we saw, remember, Rick talked about 50% absolutely, 25% are in line and 25% are behind. In order to try to influence that, we changed our process to say, we're not going to muscle through, we're going to make sure a store is ready to convert and ready to realize the full potential of the multi-price when we execute it. And we'll continue to learn from the rollout and make changes as we go. Yeah, Paul, I'll take the first one and I'll let Jeff tackle the separation of business. So, this is macro belt tightening. I mean, we see it, we see we're growing traffic. We see the 2.8 million new customers we've added. We hear the feedback on multi-price and that they love that they can get more, we get more share of their wallet, they can, not have to drive somewhere else to fill in the shop. But they're really changing, as you look at some of the discretionary, in Q2, we saw some changes in terms of how they celebrate. And that is just belt tightening by our consumer and one that we feel they need us more now than ever. And so, we'll be there to help them celebrate as they do need the discretionary and go back to a little more celebration and invite more people to a party and doing all the things that really the kind of the holidays demand. Jeff? Yeah. And as I look at just the new stores we opened, the renovations we're doing, and then when you talk about more than 3,000 stores that we'll touch this year, that is an investment in our store standards. That is making our stores better for our customers. And so we look and we like what that future looks like. We like the ability to kind of touch the chain every year and get back on a track of really showing our customer that we care by bringing in new things that excite them, new things that wow them, and really true to who Dollar Tree is. So, I mean, I look at it and say, our customer needs our business more than ever and we're continuing to evolve the business to meet them where they are. Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning, and thank you for all our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar associates out there serving our customers and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  \n It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Bob LaFleur, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRobert LaFleur: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Dollar Tree's First Quarter fiscal 2024 results. With me today are Dollar Tree's Chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling; and CFO, Jeff Davis.  \n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that some of the remarks that we will make today about the company's expectations, plans and future prospects are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements.  \n For information on the risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please see the risk factors, Business and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in our annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 20, 2024, our most recent press release and Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC.  \n We caution against reliance on any forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in today's earnings release available on the IR section of our website.  \n These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP results. Unless otherwise stated, we will refer to our financial results on a GAAP basis. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons discussed today for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 are against the same period a year ago. Please note that a supplemental slide deck outlining selected operating metrics is available on the IR section of our website. Following our prepared remarks, Rick and Jeff will take your questions. Given the number of callers who would like to participate in today's session, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question.  \n I'd now like to turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thanks, Bob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I'd like to begin my remarks today by extending my heartfelt gratitude to members of our Dollar Tree community following the devastating tornado in Marietta, Oklahoma. While the tornado destroyed our Dollar Tree distribution center there, I'm especially thankful that no one was injured in our facility. I am also extremely proud of the resilience displayed by our team members in the aftermath of this tragic event.  \n Fortunately, our distribution network is flexible and while we expect to absorb incremental operating costs, we believe we will keep store level disruption to a minimum. The leadership team at Dollar Tree is also highly sensitive to the wider impact of this disaster on our associates, their families and the broader Marietta community. With this in mind, we set up a temporary site at a local hotel to help support our associates in their time of need.  \n We brought in food and other essential supplies such as batteries, chargers, diapers and toiletries. Our associates have access to over $200,000 a in immediate response grants and mental health services. For everyone impacted by the recent situation in Marietta, I want to thank you for everything you've done during this difficult time. It's during these periods of adversity that the strength and character of our organization shines through.  \n Whether it's dealing with natural disasters or important strategic decisions, our associates and the communities they serve are always top of mind. As I'm sure you saw in our announcement earlier today, we are initiating a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business. The decision to explore strategic alternatives includes evaluating how each separate banner might appeal differently to different sets of owners.  \n It also includes evaluating whether accelerating Dollar Tree's growth and completing Family Dollars transformation might be best accomplished by separate dedicated leadership teams separating the 2 businesses could enhance the performance of each 1 individually and allow them both to reach their true valuation potential.  \n Let me provide some additional background and context. We have been on a multiyear journey to transform this organization and fully unlock its intrinsic value. An important step in this process was our portfolio review and the decision to close 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores. Many of these stores had been underinvested in for years and the capital investment required to fix them could not deliver an acceptable rate of return.  \n Moving forward with a streamlined portfolio should help accelerate Family Dollar's transformation and improve the long-term returns of the business. While we are working to transform Family Dollar, we continue to aggressively grow the Dollar Tree banner by expanding our multi-price offering accelerating our rate of new store openings and pursuing accretive transactions like our recent acquisition of up to 170 stores out of the $0.99 only bankruptcy.  \n These stores are highly complementary to the Dollar Tree banner and are expected to produce sales, profits and returns that are well above our portfolio average. We are pleased to bring these locations under the Dollar Tree banner and look forward to their openings later this year. Today, each banner is at a different stage of its respective journey and each has its own set of unique needs. This is why we believe now is the right time to conduct a thorough review of strategic alternatives for Family Dollar so we can determine what is the proper operational and ownership structure to best support and enable its transformation.  \n At the same time, that should allow us to fully unlock the value of the Dollar Tree banner. In the end, we want to ensure that both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners have the right strategic, operational and capital structures necessary to meet the evolving needs of their customers and to maximize value creation in each business.  \n As I said in my opening, our associates and the communities they serve are always top of mind for us. For 65 years, Family Dollar has played an incredibly important role in neighborhoods across America by helping families do more with less. This would not be possible without the dedication of our incredible Family Dollar associates. One of the priorities of this strategic review is to make sure that Family Dollar is properly positioned for long-term prosperity.  \n All that said, we are still in the very early stages of this review. We have not made any pre judgments regarding the eventual outcome of this process especially given the wide range of potential outcomes. As I'm sure you can appreciate, there is a lot of work to be done, and we do not intend to provide any further updates unless and until the Board has approved a specific course of action or determined that further disclosures are appropriate or necessary. I thank you in advance for your understanding on this manner.  \n With that, let's move on to our first quarter results. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 was at the higher end of our outlook range. These results reflect favorable freight costs and careful expense management during the quarter. You've heard me say many times that the 3 key fundamentals in retail are growth in transactions, sales per square foot and units. And I'm pleased to report all 3 of these metrics continue to move in the right direction.  \n Let me now cover some key financial highlights from the quarter. On a consolidated basis, net sales increased 4.2% to $7.6 billion. Enterprise comp was 1% and as a 2.1% increase in traffic was partially offset by a 1.1% decline in average ticket. In both segments, comp growth was driven by traffic gains that were partially offset by lower average tickets. The average ticket declines reflected weaker discretionary demand, particularly in the Dollar Tree segment.  \n Looking at performance by banner. Dollar Tree comps increased 1.7% on a 2.8% increase in customer traffic, partially offset by 1.1% decrease in average ticket. Dollar Tree's consumable comp was 7.4% and its discretionary comp declined 3.2% while a 7.4% consumables comp is respectable in its own right, it is worth noting that this came on top of a 6.9% consumables comp last year. On the other hand, this was the first discretionary comp decline we've seen at Dollar Tree since the first quarter of 2020 at the outset of the pandemic. Dollar Tree's quarter 1 comp came in below expectations because Easter was especially challenging for us this year. Easter is historically a major driver of discretionary demand -- in fact, to put things in perspective, Easter discretionary sales represent about 1% of our annual sales.  \n For the largest retailers, that figure is closer to 0.1%. Looked at another way, Easter is 10x more important to Dollar Tree than it is for other retailers. This year, in early Easter, combined with the extra week in our fourth quarter last year left us with a much shorter selling season. Also unusually cold and wet weather throughout much of the country negatively impacted the way many families celebrate this traditionally spring-oriented, outdoor centric holiday.  \n In fact, recent consumer research showed that Easter gatherings were down 20% this year and that 6 million fewer American households purchased Easter products in 2024. This dampened consumer demand across our seasonal discretionary assortment, which caters heavily to these types of celebrations. We also saw related softness in non-Easter discretionary categories like garden supplies, outdoor toys and other seasonal items.  \n While the calendar shift was contemplated in our first quarter comp guidance, the unusual weather was not. Overall, the soft Easter highly influenced the monthly cadence of our quarter 1 comp. It's also important to note that this softness was Dollar Tree specific and concentrated in the 8 to 10 days prior to Easter. Comps before and after that were essentially in line with our quarterly expectations. All in, we believe Easter was a 150 basis point drag on Dollar Tree's first quarter comp. Despite this, Dollar Tree took meaningful consumable market share in the quarter with our dollar growth exceeding the market by 660 basis points and our unit growth exceeding the market by 520 basis points.  \n Last quarter, I announced the next phase of our multi-price strategy called more choices. As part of this program, we are expanding our multi-price assortment by over 300 items at price points above $1.25 and approximately 3,000 Dollar Tree stores by year-end. Importantly, these multi-price items are being fully integrated into aisles throughout the store rather than concentrated in a single center store aisle.  \n Before I expand on this program, let me take a moment to reiterate what multi-price is and what it is not. Multi-price has never been about raising prices on existing items. It's about adding new items at new price points that are incremental to our core assortment. Multi-price offers our customers the high-quality products that they've come to expect at price points that represent a compelling value proposition in the categories that are most relevant to them.  \n Multi-price is designed to complement our core $1.25 strategy, not replace it. Even as we expand our multi-price assortment, we expect that at least 80% of the items in any Dollar Tree store will remain at that entry level price point.  \n Now back to the rollout. By the end of the quarter, we had converted roughly 10% of Dollar Tree stores to the new in-line multi-price configuration. To date, we are pleased with the performance of this latest group of stores, which are outcomping our $1.25 only in Dollar Tree Plus stores. As we roll out our latest concept to 2,000 more stores over the balance of this year, we are proactively taking steps to minimize any operational disruption by using teams of dedicated third-party specialists to complete the conversions. I'm excited about our multi-price journey.  \n Post-conversion comps are running at or above expectations at the vast majority of stores that we have transitioned. That said, there is a bit of a learning curve with multi-price as we evolve from our fixed price legacy. This is a new discipline for us and it will take us a little bit of time to fully build out our core competencies. But we're off to a good start. And so far, I'm pleased with the customer response to our new offerings.  \n Shifting over to Family Dollar. Top line performance in quarter 1 was in line with our expectations. Comps were up 0.1% as we cycled a 6.6% comp in quarter 1 of last year. Customer traffic increased 0.9%, which was partially offset by a 0.8% decrease in average ticket. Both traffic and ticket trends improved on a sequential basis as the multiple merchandising initiatives and growth strategies we've launched over the past several quarters continue to progress.  \n Family Dollar's consumable comp was up 1.4% and its discretionary comp was down 4.7%. While Family Dollar's discretionary comp is still negative, it is worth pointing out that the underlying trend has gradually improved. The pace of mix shift towards consumables of Family Dollar has definitely slowed. And since quarter 1 of last year, our 2-year stack discretionary comp has improved by 1,000 basis points.  \n While our lower income consumers continue to deal with inflation, higher interest rates and reduced government benefits. We are encouraged that the worst of the SNAP headwinds appear to be behind us. While lower SNAP benefits were a meaningful 280 basis point drag on Family Dollar's first quarter comp, this was a 200 basis point sequential improvement over the quarter 4 SNAP headwinds. Similar to Dollar Tree, Family Dollar also continues to gain consumables market share with our dollar growth exceeding the market by 180 basis points and our unit growth exceeding the market by 80 basis points. \n Lastly, on Family Dollar, let me take a moment and update you on the portfolio optimization. We closed 506 underperforming Family Dollar stores in the first quarter. The remaining 90 or so stores we identified in the initial round of closures were closed in May. None of the stores that closed in quarter 1 are included in our comp results, although any revenues and expenses from the time they were opened are included in our quarter 1 P&L. Before I turn things over to Jeff, I want to again emphasize that our operating performance in both segments remain strong.  \n At Dollar Tree, we continue to acquire new customers and gain market share as our next generation of multi-price resonates with a broader base of consumers. And at Family Dollar, we believe the decisive actions we took to solidify the portfolio will have a positive impact on operations in return. As a more streamlined organization, I am confident that Family Dollar's best days are ahead of it. based on the wide range of growth initiatives that are in place.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffrey Davis: Thank you, Rick, and good morning. I will start by discussing our first quarter results, after which I'll provide comments on our Q2 and fiscal 2024 outlook. Where applicable, I will focus on our adjusted results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in our earnings release.  \n Let's begin by looking at the business on a consolidated basis. Net sales increased by 4.2% to $7.6 billion. Adjusted operating income was $436 million, a 3% decrease from last year. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 45 basis points reflecting a 30 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 75 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin improvement came from lower freight costs, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and elevated shrink. Adjusted SG&A increased primarily from temporary labor for Dollar Tree's multi-price rollout, higher depreciation and amortization and sales deleverage. Adjusted Q1 SG&A this year exclude $17.5 million of severance and other store closure costs and a $2.5 million reversal of a legal accrual. Q1 last year excluded a $30 million legal accrual.  \n Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 23.3%. Adjusted net income was $312 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.43.  \n Moving to our business segment results. Dollar Tree's net sales increased 5.9% to $4.2 billion. Operating income decreased 3% to $522 million. Operating margin decreased 110 basis points, driven by a 10 basis point increase in gross margin offset by a 120 basis point increase in SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin improved primarily from lower freight costs. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and elevated shrink. SG&A expenses increased primarily due to temporary labor for the multi-price conversions, higher depreciation and amortization and sales deleverage.  \n Family Dollar's net sales increased by 2% to $3.5 billion. Adjusted operating income was $51 million, a 32% increase from last year and adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points. The increase was all attributable to gross margin as the adjusted SG&A rate was flat at 23.7%. Gross margin increased primarily from lower freight, partially offset by product cost increases and an unfavorable sales mix. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Inventory decreased by 2% or $103 million. On a related note, in the quarter, we recorded a $70 million loss related to the book value of inventory destroyed at our Marietta distribution center and a $47 million loss related to property and equipment destruction. Given our expansive scale and breadth of operations, our insurance policies include significant property and inventory coverage above cost. Based on the catastrophic nature of this event, we expect these losses to be fully offset by insurance recoveries. As our recorded losses were fully offset by the insurance receivable, there was no net impact to the first quarter P&L.  \n With cash and cash equivalents of $618 million and long-term debt of $3.4 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our bank-defined leverage at quarter end stood at approximately 2.3x, which continues to underpin our investment-grade credit worthiness. Regarding cash flow, we generated $696 million from operating activities compared to $752 million last year. Capital expenditures were $472 million in the quarter versus $350 million last year reflecting accelerated new store openings and ongoing investments in growth and other initiatives. Notwithstanding the higher CapEx spending, we generated $224 million in free cash flow in the quarter compared to $402 million last year. Consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, after investing in the growth of our business, we returned $310 million to our shareholders by repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $122 per share.  \n At quarter end, we had approximately $1 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. \n Now let me provide some perspective on our second quarter and full year expectations. Our current outlook reflects the following: we expect to incur additional operating expenses related to the loss of our Marietta DC. The EPS impact of incremental transportation and other costs is estimated to be approximately $0.10 in Q2 and approximately $0.20 to $0.30 on a full year basis. As more information on the costs associated with this disruption becomes available, we may revisit this outlook in subsequent quarters. The expected impact of freight, shrink, mix, and SNAP on our full year adjusted EPS outlook remains consistent with the expectations we outlined last quarter.  \n Additionally, given the relatively low level of our freight volume that is subject to spot rates, we believe our exposure to recently observed volatility in the global shipping markets is limited and may be partially offset by favorable domestic carrier cost. With that as a background, for the second quarter, we expect net sales will be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion based on a comparable net sales growth in the low single digits for the enterprise, 2% to 4% for Dollar Tree segment and approximately flat for the Family Dollar segment. Adjusting for the stores that were closed as part of the portfolio optimization. We expect second quarter net sales for the Family Dollar segment to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. We expect adjusted EPS will be in the range of $1 to $1.10, which reflects the incremental operating expense associated with the loss of the Marietta DC.  \n For the full year, we still expect net sales to be in the range of $31 billion to $32 billion. Although at this point in time, we think we are more likely to be in the lower half of that range. We still expect comparable net sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the enterprise, the mid-single digits for Dollar Tree segment and the low single digits for the Family Dollar segment. Adjusting for stores closed as part of the portfolio optimization, we expect full year net sales for Family Dollar to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $6.50 to $7, again, reflecting the incremental operating expenses associated with the loss of Marietta.  \n Our outlook for Q2 in the fiscal year does not include any severance or additional incremental costs related to the portfolio review or related workforce reductions. It also excludes any future share repurchases. In the interest of time, I will direct you to our supplemental financial presentation, which is available on our IR website for the remaining details that support our current guidance.  \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. \nRichard Dreiling: Thanks, Jeff. We are pleased that we delivered first quarter adjusted EPS results towards the high end of our outlook range. At Dollar Tree, we overcame some Easter softness and remain focused on rapidly rolling out our next generation of multi-price stores. At Family Dollar, we are taking the difficult but necessary steps to position the business for long-term prosperity. Change is never easy, and I couldn't be prouder of our 200,000 associates across Dollar Tree and Family Dollar for their ongoing commitment to their communities and the customers that they serve. I am truly honored to lead and be part of 1 of the best teams in retail.  \n Operator, with that, Jeff and I are ready to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: So I wanted to start with Dollar Tree. You've maintained the mid-single-digit comp guidance for the year. Q1 was obviously a little bit softer. Can you just help us what underpins the confidence around that?  \n And then, Rick, as it relates to this concept, obviously, there's a lot going on with multiple price points, you're accelerating growth. Can you give us a little bit more perspective on how you see the future of this business? What do you think the earnings growth profile is here over a multiyear basis and the real opportunity? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, sir. I'll take the first part and you can add the second part. The confidence I have in Dollar Tree as we move through the year is the impact of multi-price point. We continue to see trade down customers into that brand. I love the traffic -- and the multi-price stores, Ed, are out-comping the stores that have no multi-price in them, and they're outcomping the stores that have the valley of multi-price.  \n We continue to be pleased with where we're going with consumables, and we also see nothing but upside in regards to the basket as we introduce these new items. So I'm very, very bullish on the Dollar Tree side. And by the way, just for a reference point, the basket, when there's a multi-price item, and it is 2x larger than our normal basket. And they also multi-price is driving more trips into the stores. And you've heard me repeatedly talk about transactions are 1 of the key drivers of the future. \nJeffrey Davis: Just to maybe add a couple more points on the multi-price before going into longer-term profitability. On the multi-price, we mentioned that we had roughly 10% of the stores that have been converted to the in-line conversion. That happened over the course of the first quarter those stores are still ramping up. We will still continue to roll that out for another 2,000 stores in the rest of the year that ramp-up will give us some additional sort of tailwind, if you will.  \n On top of that, our comps, I don't know if you've noticed, and you probably have by looking at some of the things that we've published before, but our comps actually get to be a little softer in comparison in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year with the second quarter being our most stringent sort of compare.  \n The second part of your question, I believe, was with respect to how we're thinking about the long-term profitability of the enterprise and the brand. And we continue to be very encouraged by what we're seeing across both banners. The multi-price offering is allowing us to drive sales and volumes to drive greater profitability.  \n We continue to deliver from a standpoint of higher freight cost. We believe that there's opportunity across the Family Dollar brand to continue to drive greater gross margins as we continue to drive continued improvement in private label as well as the OTC and HBA. The combination of these things will allow us to drive greater gross profit dollars in the organization as we continue to drive greater discipline in our expenses along the way. So the outlook that we have for the year, we feel very confident in.  \n There's the opportunity to manage through some of this. So at this point, we really don't have any additional outlook considerations to provide other than the fact that we continue to remain on the numbers that we've given you so far. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. \nMichael Lasser: My question is a 2 parter on the strategic process. If you are not able to sell Family Dollar what is the plan B? And as a way to help us frame what the ongoing earnings power of the business could look like, can you give us a sense of how much the corporate overhead is allocated to Family Dollar and what the dissynergies might be if you were to divest the Family Dollar business. \nRichard Dreiling: Michael, thank you for the question. It's too soon in the process for me to say what's going to happen or exactly what all the alternatives are. So I'd like to stay away from that and come back to my original comment that I promised to keep you all updated. In terms of how the corporate overhead is basically, I think in terms of 50-50. I would also look at you and say that the business, the supply chain, merchandising and retail are all pretty much separate. There is some legal, HR, the basic functions are a little intertwined, but the most important pieces are not. Jeff, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that? \nJeffrey Davis: I think that covers it. \nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So a couple of questions, 1 near-term, 1 multiyear. So at the Dollar Tree banner, near-term, just thinking about the 2% to 4% comp guidance for the second quarter, what trends have you seen post Easter? Maybe if you can comment on quarter-to-date just to provide some confidence around the 2% to 4% relative to the first quarter.  \n And then multiyear, Rick, could you just elaborate on the acceleration strategy at Dollar Tree? Maybe speak to the acquisition? Is there any ceiling to consider in terms of annual unit growth and just how you're thinking about long-term saturation for that concept? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. A couple of great questions there. Do you want me to take the first question? \nUnknown Executive: Yes, I'll let the first one, I'll take the second one. \nJeffrey Davis: So Matt, the guidance that we gave of 2% to 4% comp for the Dollar Tree banner coming out of Q1, we're in line with that guidance that's the reason why we've provided it. As we came out of that Easter period, and we had mentioned in our prepared remarks that in the absence of 8 to 10 day period, we actually pretty much through the course of the quarter, had a comp that was pretty reflective of a mid-single-digit comp -- I'm sorry, a low to mid-single-digit comps. So I think we're still in line with that as we move into Q2. \nRichard Dreiling: And in regards to the long-term future of the company, you look at $0.99, the acquisition there totally reflects Matt our commitment to the Dollar Tree franchise and the fact that we think that there are opportunities there to grow the business even more.  \n The acquisition in California to be very frank, is going to generate returns above our average in the overall chain. And we are very excited about these stores in terms of the real estate that we were able to acquire in the term we have on them. And as we've said on many occasions, a well-run Dollar Tree is an exceptionally powerful retail format. And we are committed and I actually think I'm going to say this, multi-price is attracting a higher-income consumer into that box. And I think we have a lot of really good things moving together right now. \nOperator: Next question is coming from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. \nUnknown Analyst: This is actually Anders Meyer on for John. So I just wanted to touch on the cooler resets. So overall, how have they been progressing? What has been the overall impact to comps? And upon completion, how do you size the sales opportunity with this product? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. I mean the cooler work we're doing is basically on both franchises incredibly pleased with what's going on in the Family Dollar banner. We're pooling the number of cooler doors up to approximately 30. And it is driving incremental sales into the store overall. \n And the consumer is moving more to refrigerated and frozen product. Now on the Dollar Tree side, we now have 5,700 stores that have multi-price frozen food in them. We've expanded the assortment in 1,900 stores and to be very frank, one of the big surprises for us is frozen and refrigerated in the Dollar Tree banner. The multi-price unlock that category and you have to think about it. You go into a Dollar Tree, you can buy a pizza for $4 or $5 that feeds a family of 4. And that is a very powerful statement. So very pleased continuing to push it. It's where the consumer is going and both banners are chasing it. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I want to ask about Family Dollar, but be respectful if you can't answer, I'll put a second question about Dollar Tree in as well. I wanted to ask if the EBIT that we see in the P&L, I think it's going to get a little bit better. You're going to run rate a little bit better from what the leftover stores look like. \n Can you tell us if there's a big distribution call it, among the 7,000 remaining Family Dollar stores, a wide range of profit outcomes or if they're relatively concentrated. And then are you able to share what the average life of the leases are in that portfolio? And then have you talked about or can you share what the lease break costs could look like? \nJeffrey Davis: Let's see if I can take a few pieces of that. \nRichard Dreiling: And then I'll take the couple. \nJeffrey Davis: Some of this, of course, we aren't in a position to share, but I can tell you that as you look at the remaining portfolio of stores, you still have a sort of a distribution of profitability across those stores at a much higher level than what you would have had before we closed the nonperforming stores. \n We had already indicated also that for the year, you should expect about $0.15 of additional profitability -- increased profitability coming from those closed stores and $0.30 of EPS on an annualized basis. Our leases that we enter into are normally somewhere between 5 to 10 years on average. At any one point in time, approximately 10% to 12% of those leases are being renewed on an annual basis. And that's about what I can really share with you at this point with respect to the lease obligations. \nRichard Dreiling: And the 1 thing I would say as you reflect on this announcement is the fact that we have not lost faith in Family Dollar and the progress it's making. The team has done a great job of implementing many initiatives that are designed to drive the long-term growth. What we're wrestling with and trying to figure out is we have 2 different brands at 2 different stages of where they're at in their development. \n And while we want to accelerate Dollar Tree, we want to position Family Dollar's transformation where it has the chance to grow. And by looking at them differently that might provide more acceleration for both brands long-term. \nOperator: Next question today is coming from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So just going back to your commentary on multi-price point expansion. We've been in some of your newer locations with the new product. Just any surprises in consumer behavior that you're seeing in store, what type of consumer feedback are you guys seeing with those -- with that expansion? \n And then just want to get a sense how the consumables versus discretionary mix is playing out versus expectations within those locations. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. A couple of great questions. Our biggest problem with multi-price right now is we can't keep it on the shelf. The consumer is responding to it. The consumer likes it. And I think it's going to be -- I don't think, I believe, truly believe it is going to be a very powerful piece in our ongoing future. \n You will see, as we move through the calendar year, as you guys know, we have to buy multi-price products, seasonal product more than a year in advance as we get into the holidays, you're going to see more multi-price show up on the discretionary side. I am pretty positive for the first time, we'll have an inexpensive Christmas tree in our stores that will probably have Christmas lights that will go with all the Christmas decorations we sell. \n In regards to consumables, multi-price points, again, are driving what's going on with our consumable share. And what we are committed that we are not raising the price or introducing like items we are bringing in different SKUs, which broadens the appeal of the assortment to the consumer. \nJeffrey Davis: I had just 1 other point. with multi-price, as we're looking at those stores that have had this in-line conversion, the mix of discretionary and consumables is more in line with what we would have seen historically with a heavier balance on discretionary than consumables. So we like that balance in that the multi-price is not only driving consumables, but it's also lifting the discretionary basket also. \nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Just a follow-up on that last comment. What is the change that you see in terms of traffic versus ticket in the multi-price converted stores. That's my first follow-up. .\n And second, I'm curious what you're seeing in the promotional landscape. What do you see in 1Q versus your expectations, but also curious what you assume for the rest of the year and what you've seen -- based on what you've seen year-to-date on the promotional landscape out there. \nRichard Dreiling: So with -- the first part of the question is, we see traffic increase in the multi-price stores to the tune of about approximately 3%, and we also see the ticket goes up about 55 bps. And again, it's soon. Again, I want to come back to, we're building a new muscle. I would look at you and say, off the top of my head, I'm guessing the old retailer in me. 50% of the stores are probably outperforming our expectation, maybe 25% are right on it and 25% have opportunities. \nJeffrey Davis: And look, we're definitely seeing the customer right now buying a little bit more on promotion. And it's not that there is more promotional activity, but what the customer is actually buying is items on promotion. \nRichard Dreiling: And I think what's important on the promotion thing is that Jeff is in my office every Monday asking me what's going on in the promotional landscape, we have seen nothing irrational at this time. And I think that's really important. \n And what we are seeing is maybe incremental movements on CSD, soda pop and 2-liter pop. And that is a very easy traffic driver. But I always remind everybody I talk to, we have to not confuse marking down stale inventory with promotional activity. And I think that's really, really important. So stable environment, I would say it's not irrational and maybe CSD. \nOperator: Next question today is coming from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: So Rick, on the new multi-price rollout, can you talk about the transition once the third-party specialists have actually done the reset? In other words, what's the risk and you talked about the new discipline that store managers and employees are going to need to acquire post those specialists doing the initial reset. \n And then for Jeff, how much of the SG&A deleverage in the first quarter was from the resets? And I think you guys have outlined $23 million of expenses this year. Can you just talk about the phasing of that? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. Chuck, again, a couple of great questions. First one, I'll take. We have grown up in an environment in this company where everything is the same price point, so it doesn't matter where it goes, and it doesn't matter what the customer does with the product if they decide they don't want it. \n Now what we have to do is -- and what we're doing is we're introducing the multi-price SKUs into the category that they belong in. We're not just putting them in the center of the store. So you have to create a section, quite frankly, that bears prices, so the consumer knows how much they are. And when the consumer changes their mind, that product has to get back into the right spot on the shelf. And that's all about teaching our associates how to handle that product in regards to stocking it and then what to do with it when they condition the store. \n Now it's a very comparable discipline but it's not something that we've had over the years. We're doing all kinds of things to manage that. We put a shelf label literally on the outside of the case that allows the associate to put the product on the shelf, put the shelf tag on the shelf. But believe it or not, we also have to teach the people in the warehouse when they pull the item, they had to pull the right item because they're used to pulling 1 item that has the same price and in regards to the store's inventory, it stays true. But now the difference is if they're pulling a multi-price point item, it has to get there as it was supposed to be selected. \nJeffrey Davis: And then, Chuck, with respect to the SG&A, margin deleverage, if you will. This is really 3 components. You called out the temporary labor was absolutely the largest component. The second component was higher depreciation and the third component was just sort of deleverage as a result of the lower comp. The 1 thing to recognize with the temp labor in the first stores that we opened up. There's a learning curve as to the -- how to go about it the number of crews that were actually allocated, how working with the store leadership teams. \n We continue to make progress on that in the subsequent stores that we're rolling out. So sort of the initial headwind that we had in the first quarter here, we would expect that to moderate over time. But as we had mentioned earlier, we definitely thought that the impact of using this third-party labor to do the in-line conversions was going to cost us approximately $0.23 of EPS for the year. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Seth Sigman from Barclays. \nSeth Sigman: I want to talk about shrink. It hasn't come up a ton. It was a headwind this quarter, but I think that was expected. Just curious how that played out with some of the mitigation efforts, any signs of stabilization given that you didn't change the guidance for that? \n And then I guess a question on gross margin overall the improvement was a little bit more limited this quarter. I'm just curious, was that mix or something else? If you could just help us with that? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes, I'll take the shrink question, if that's okay.  I think the efforts we've put in place for the first time, I can honestly say the shrink trends that we have, why they still are not good they're not getting away from us anymore. We're definitely tracking in the right direction. But I want to reinforce, shrink is still a problem, but it's not deteriorating like it was last year. We feel very good with the initiatives we've put in place. I also think it's fair to say that we were ahead on the shrink curve that we were calling it out and we were taking steps that people now are taking around us. \n Our self-checkout exposure is basically nothing. So we don't have to revisit that. We have started eliminating high-shrink SKUs. We started that about a year ago. And we've also placed things behind the check stand counters where we can control them. So I'm pleased we are not out of the woods, but at least I can tell you that it has stabilized. \nJeffrey Davis: Yes, just to put maybe a little bit of finer point on it. Our expectation for the first half of the year was that we were going to have about $0.30 to $0.35 of headwind across shrink and mix and that was predominantly going to be on mix. What we're seeing is that our performance is in line with that. We're actually seeing some slight improvement against it, but we're still early in the year. So as Rick has said, the investments that we were making -- and we did a lot of that on the Family Dollar side. First is a proof of concept and now growing some of those self-help opportunities across the Dollar Tree banner also. \n As it relates to gross margin, the gross margin pressure really from Dollar Tree was really more as a result of consumable mix by not having that discretionary Easter complement in our overall performance for the quarter is what really put pressure on the gross margin. \n On the Family Dollar side, very healthy improvement in gross margins overall of 40 basis points. So notwithstanding the impact of Easter, we're very happy with where we're trending as it relates to our gross margins. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: So I wanted to ask you about the supply chain. You've been making a lot of investments there. You have rotacarts that are making store deliveries now as part of your fleet. Can you talk about what are some of the early benefits that you're seeing so far regarding in-stock availability, inventory turns is it helping reduce shrink and transportation damages? And just how best to think about the overall labor hour savings that you're able to take from the supply chain investments and then reallocate the store hours? \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. There's a lot there. Let me see if I can distill it down to just a couple of elements. The first DC that we rolled out was Matthews, North Carolina. It was a Family Dollar DC -- it's 1 in which previously they were delivering to the store off of pallets. So now we're doing it off of rotacarts. \n What we're actually seeing is improved delivery time on low time, which is what we were anticipating. We are also seeing a level of reduced damages, as you had mentioned, is the way that this product is being handled. And we're also seeing a higher level of associate sort of engagement and satisfaction, recognizing that it is helping to improve the way that they do their jobs. \n The next DC that we just really kicked off is here in Chesapeake. It's a Dollar Tree DC we're seeing a nice once again, reduction in unload times. It's allowing us now to get product to the shelf quicker and to basically fulfill some of the outs that we have on the shelf. But overall, the in-store in-stocks are improving as well as the DC service levels to these stores. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: I just wanted to ask kind of 2-part thing. One was there's an improvement implied in the back half for EBIT margin of 100 bps plus versus potentially flattish in the front half. So just wanted to see the top couple of drivers of that, that gives you the conviction for that. \n And then as a follow-up, you all did the incremental acquisition for the 99 Cent stores, as you mentioned. So is it feasible to see kind of $10 plus of EPS power just from core Dollar Tree now as you think out. \nRichard Dreiling: So I'll let you handle the first part of the question. The second part of the question, it's too soon to know that. I'd like to stay away from that for now, if that's appropriate. Go ahead. \nJeffrey Davis: And Michael, as we think about sort of the phasing of our overall EPS for the year, I appreciate your question. It really kind of can get bucketed into a couple of areas. From a top line perspective, we talked about multi-pricing the acceleration of that as we continue to roll out the in-line conversions. \n You also have shrink in mix is for us we believe will be more neutralized in the back half of the year than in the front half. And we -- once again, that $0.30 to $0.35 of EPS headwind was really on the first half. We also believe that from a SNAP perspective, while SNAP is still within our expectations. In the back half, we think that we may have some tailwinds as a result of the October cola adjustment that may be available -- will be available this question is how much. \n And then the last component is, if you remember last year, in the back half of the year, we had a couple of foot faults, if you will. We had an OTC recall that was about $0.05 of EPS. We had an accrual adjustment that we needed to make on general liability, very specifically around some of the claims that we're going back to pre-pandemic, that was around $0.17. \n And then last but not least, as we had mentioned, with the portfolio optimization, we are expecting a $0.15 EPS improvement. That is predominantly going to be in the back half of the year. So on balance, as a result of top line acceleration of revenue growth, and then some of the softer compares against some of these elements with respect to shrink and SNAP and then the last components are those foot faults, which we believe were onetime in nature. \nOperator: Our final question today is coming from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. \nPriya Ohri-Gupta: I know it's a bit early in the process, but I was just hoping that perhaps you could talk to us a little bit about how you're thinking about sort of your credit rating with regard possible considerations for Family Dollar? Would the expectation be to try to maintain your existing rating as you consider these various alternatives? Or would it be to at least maintain investment grade. \nRichard Dreiling: Yes. So our investment-grade rating is an important element of our overall sort of financial policy, if you will. We believe that it's too early to get out ahead of ourselves as to what a structure may be or the ultimate outcome of the strategic review. But we believe that given the underlying business, the power of the cash flows generated by this business, the growth -- and quite honestly, how we basically execute our capital allocation is all in line with keeping us in an investment-grade level. \nOperator: We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments. \nRichard Dreiling: Thank you all for taking your time to talk to us today and look forward to catching up down the road. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Dreiling",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I'd like to begin my remarks today by extending my heartfelt gratitude to members of our Dollar Tree community following the devastating tornado in Marietta, Oklahoma. While the tornado destroyed our Dollar Tree distribution center there, I'm especially thankful that no one was injured in our facility. I am also extremely proud of the resilience displayed by our team members in the aftermath of this tragic event.  \n Fortunately, our distribution network is flexible and while we expect to absorb incremental operating costs, we believe we will keep store level disruption to a minimum. The leadership team at Dollar Tree is also highly sensitive to the wider impact of this disaster on our associates, their families and the broader Marietta community. With this in mind, we set up a temporary site at a local hotel to help support our associates in their time of need.  \n We brought in food and other essential supplies such as batteries, chargers, diapers and toiletries. Our associates have access to over $200,000 a in immediate response grants and mental health services. For everyone impacted by the recent situation in Marietta, I want to thank you for everything you've done during this difficult time. It's during these periods of adversity that the strength and character of our organization shines through.  \n Whether it's dealing with natural disasters or important strategic decisions, our associates and the communities they serve are always top of mind. As I'm sure you saw in our announcement earlier today, we are initiating a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business. The decision to explore strategic alternatives includes evaluating how each separate banner might appeal differently to different sets of owners.  \n It also includes evaluating whether accelerating Dollar Tree's growth and completing Family Dollars transformation might be best accomplished by separate dedicated leadership teams separating the 2 businesses could enhance the performance of each 1 individually and allow them both to reach their true valuation potential.  \n Let me provide some additional background and context. We have been on a multiyear journey to transform this organization and fully unlock its intrinsic value. An important step in this process was our portfolio review and the decision to close 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores. Many of these stores had been underinvested in for years and the capital investment required to fix them could not deliver an acceptable rate of return.  \n Moving forward with a streamlined portfolio should help accelerate Family Dollar's transformation and improve the long-term returns of the business. While we are working to transform Family Dollar, we continue to aggressively grow the Dollar Tree banner by expanding our multi-price offering accelerating our rate of new store openings and pursuing accretive transactions like our recent acquisition of up to 170 stores out of the $0.99 only bankruptcy.  \n These stores are highly complementary to the Dollar Tree banner and are expected to produce sales, profits and returns that are well above our portfolio average. We are pleased to bring these locations under the Dollar Tree banner and look forward to their openings later this year. Today, each banner is at a different stage of its respective journey and each has its own set of unique needs. This is why we believe now is the right time to conduct a thorough review of strategic alternatives for Family Dollar so we can determine what is the proper operational and ownership structure to best support and enable its transformation.  \n At the same time, that should allow us to fully unlock the value of the Dollar Tree banner. In the end, we want to ensure that both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners have the right strategic, operational and capital structures necessary to meet the evolving needs of their customers and to maximize value creation in each business.  \n As I said in my opening, our associates and the communities they serve are always top of mind for us. For 65 years, Family Dollar has played an incredibly important role in neighborhoods across America by helping families do more with less. This would not be possible without the dedication of our incredible Family Dollar associates. One of the priorities of this strategic review is to make sure that Family Dollar is properly positioned for long-term prosperity.  \n All that said, we are still in the very early stages of this review. We have not made any pre judgments regarding the eventual outcome of this process especially given the wide range of potential outcomes. As I'm sure you can appreciate, there is a lot of work to be done, and we do not intend to provide any further updates unless and until the Board has approved a specific course of action or determined that further disclosures are appropriate or necessary. I thank you in advance for your understanding on this manner.  \n With that, let's move on to our first quarter results. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 was at the higher end of our outlook range. These results reflect favorable freight costs and careful expense management during the quarter. You've heard me say many times that the 3 key fundamentals in retail are growth in transactions, sales per square foot and units. And I'm pleased to report all 3 of these metrics continue to move in the right direction.  \n Let me now cover some key financial highlights from the quarter. On a consolidated basis, net sales increased 4.2% to $7.6 billion. Enterprise comp was 1% and as a 2.1% increase in traffic was partially offset by a 1.1% decline in average ticket. In both segments, comp growth was driven by traffic gains that were partially offset by lower average tickets. The average ticket declines reflected weaker discretionary demand, particularly in the Dollar Tree segment.  \n Looking at performance by banner. Dollar Tree comps increased 1.7% on a 2.8% increase in customer traffic, partially offset by 1.1% decrease in average ticket. Dollar Tree's consumable comp was 7.4% and its discretionary comp declined 3.2% while a 7.4% consumables comp is respectable in its own right, it is worth noting that this came on top of a 6.9% consumables comp last year. On the other hand, this was the first discretionary comp decline we've seen at Dollar Tree since the first quarter of 2020 at the outset of the pandemic. Dollar Tree's quarter 1 comp came in below expectations because Easter was especially challenging for us this year. Easter is historically a major driver of discretionary demand -- in fact, to put things in perspective, Easter discretionary sales represent about 1% of our annual sales.  \n For the largest retailers, that figure is closer to 0.1%. Looked at another way, Easter is 10x more important to Dollar Tree than it is for other retailers. This year, in early Easter, combined with the extra week in our fourth quarter last year left us with a much shorter selling season. Also unusually cold and wet weather throughout much of the country negatively impacted the way many families celebrate this traditionally spring-oriented, outdoor centric holiday.  \n In fact, recent consumer research showed that Easter gatherings were down 20% this year and that 6 million fewer American households purchased Easter products in 2024. This dampened consumer demand across our seasonal discretionary assortment, which caters heavily to these types of celebrations. We also saw related softness in non-Easter discretionary categories like garden supplies, outdoor toys and other seasonal items.  \n While the calendar shift was contemplated in our first quarter comp guidance, the unusual weather was not. Overall, the soft Easter highly influenced the monthly cadence of our quarter 1 comp. It's also important to note that this softness was Dollar Tree specific and concentrated in the 8 to 10 days prior to Easter. Comps before and after that were essentially in line with our quarterly expectations. All in, we believe Easter was a 150 basis point drag on Dollar Tree's first quarter comp. Despite this, Dollar Tree took meaningful consumable market share in the quarter with our dollar growth exceeding the market by 660 basis points and our unit growth exceeding the market by 520 basis points.  \n Last quarter, I announced the next phase of our multi-price strategy called more choices. As part of this program, we are expanding our multi-price assortment by over 300 items at price points above $1.25 and approximately 3,000 Dollar Tree stores by year-end. Importantly, these multi-price items are being fully integrated into aisles throughout the store rather than concentrated in a single center store aisle.  \n Before I expand on this program, let me take a moment to reiterate what multi-price is and what it is not. Multi-price has never been about raising prices on existing items. It's about adding new items at new price points that are incremental to our core assortment. Multi-price offers our customers the high-quality products that they've come to expect at price points that represent a compelling value proposition in the categories that are most relevant to them.  \n Multi-price is designed to complement our core $1.25 strategy, not replace it. Even as we expand our multi-price assortment, we expect that at least 80% of the items in any Dollar Tree store will remain at that entry level price point.  \n Now back to the rollout. By the end of the quarter, we had converted roughly 10% of Dollar Tree stores to the new in-line multi-price configuration. To date, we are pleased with the performance of this latest group of stores, which are outcomping our $1.25 only in Dollar Tree Plus stores. As we roll out our latest concept to 2,000 more stores over the balance of this year, we are proactively taking steps to minimize any operational disruption by using teams of dedicated third-party specialists to complete the conversions. I'm excited about our multi-price journey.  \n Post-conversion comps are running at or above expectations at the vast majority of stores that we have transitioned. That said, there is a bit of a learning curve with multi-price as we evolve from our fixed price legacy. This is a new discipline for us and it will take us a little bit of time to fully build out our core competencies. But we're off to a good start. And so far, I'm pleased with the customer response to our new offerings.  \n Shifting over to Family Dollar. Top line performance in quarter 1 was in line with our expectations. Comps were up 0.1% as we cycled a 6.6% comp in quarter 1 of last year. Customer traffic increased 0.9%, which was partially offset by a 0.8% decrease in average ticket. Both traffic and ticket trends improved on a sequential basis as the multiple merchandising initiatives and growth strategies we've launched over the past several quarters continue to progress.  \n Family Dollar's consumable comp was up 1.4% and its discretionary comp was down 4.7%. While Family Dollar's discretionary comp is still negative, it is worth pointing out that the underlying trend has gradually improved. The pace of mix shift towards consumables of Family Dollar has definitely slowed. And since quarter 1 of last year, our 2-year stack discretionary comp has improved by 1,000 basis points.  \n While our lower income consumers continue to deal with inflation, higher interest rates and reduced government benefits. We are encouraged that the worst of the SNAP headwinds appear to be behind us. While lower SNAP benefits were a meaningful 280 basis point drag on Family Dollar's first quarter comp, this was a 200 basis point sequential improvement over the quarter 4 SNAP headwinds. Similar to Dollar Tree, Family Dollar also continues to gain consumables market share with our dollar growth exceeding the market by 180 basis points and our unit growth exceeding the market by 80 basis points. \n Lastly, on Family Dollar, let me take a moment and update you on the portfolio optimization. We closed 506 underperforming Family Dollar stores in the first quarter. The remaining 90 or so stores we identified in the initial round of closures were closed in May. None of the stores that closed in quarter 1 are included in our comp results, although any revenues and expenses from the time they were opened are included in our quarter 1 P&L. Before I turn things over to Jeff, I want to again emphasize that our operating performance in both segments remain strong.  \n At Dollar Tree, we continue to acquire new customers and gain market share as our next generation of multi-price resonates with a broader base of consumers. And at Family Dollar, we believe the decisive actions we took to solidify the portfolio will have a positive impact on operations in return. As a more streamlined organization, I am confident that Family Dollar's best days are ahead of it. based on the wide range of growth initiatives that are in place.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Thanks, Jeff. We are pleased that we delivered first quarter adjusted EPS results towards the high end of our outlook range. At Dollar Tree, we overcame some Easter softness and remain focused on rapidly rolling out our next generation of multi-price stores. At Family Dollar, we are taking the difficult but necessary steps to position the business for long-term prosperity. Change is never easy, and I couldn't be prouder of our 200,000 associates across Dollar Tree and Family Dollar for their ongoing commitment to their communities and the customers that they serve. I am truly honored to lead and be part of 1 of the best teams in retail.  \n Operator, with that, Jeff and I are ready to take your questions. Yes, sir. I'll take the first part and you can add the second part. The confidence I have in Dollar Tree as we move through the year is the impact of multi-price point. We continue to see trade down customers into that brand. I love the traffic -- and the multi-price stores, Ed, are out-comping the stores that have no multi-price in them, and they're outcomping the stores that have the valley of multi-price.  \n We continue to be pleased with where we're going with consumables, and we also see nothing but upside in regards to the basket as we introduce these new items. So I'm very, very bullish on the Dollar Tree side. And by the way, just for a reference point, the basket, when there's a multi-price item, and it is 2x larger than our normal basket. And they also multi-price is driving more trips into the stores. And you've heard me repeatedly talk about transactions are 1 of the key drivers of the future. Michael, thank you for the question. It's too soon in the process for me to say what's going to happen or exactly what all the alternatives are. So I'd like to stay away from that and come back to my original comment that I promised to keep you all updated. In terms of how the corporate overhead is basically, I think in terms of 50-50. I would also look at you and say that the business, the supply chain, merchandising and retail are all pretty much separate. There is some legal, HR, the basic functions are a little intertwined, but the most important pieces are not. Jeff, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that? Yes. A couple of great questions there. Do you want me to take the first question? And in regards to the long-term future of the company, you look at $0.99, the acquisition there totally reflects Matt our commitment to the Dollar Tree franchise and the fact that we think that there are opportunities there to grow the business even more.  \n The acquisition in California to be very frank, is going to generate returns above our average in the overall chain. And we are very excited about these stores in terms of the real estate that we were able to acquire in the term we have on them. And as we've said on many occasions, a well-run Dollar Tree is an exceptionally powerful retail format. And we are committed and I actually think I'm going to say this, multi-price is attracting a higher-income consumer into that box. And I think we have a lot of really good things moving together right now. Yes. I mean the cooler work we're doing is basically on both franchises incredibly pleased with what's going on in the Family Dollar banner. We're pooling the number of cooler doors up to approximately 30. And it is driving incremental sales into the store overall. \n And the consumer is moving more to refrigerated and frozen product. Now on the Dollar Tree side, we now have 5,700 stores that have multi-price frozen food in them. We've expanded the assortment in 1,900 stores and to be very frank, one of the big surprises for us is frozen and refrigerated in the Dollar Tree banner. The multi-price unlock that category and you have to think about it. You go into a Dollar Tree, you can buy a pizza for $4 or $5 that feeds a family of 4. And that is a very powerful statement. So very pleased continuing to push it. It's where the consumer is going and both banners are chasing it. And then I'll take the couple. And the 1 thing I would say as you reflect on this announcement is the fact that we have not lost faith in Family Dollar and the progress it's making. The team has done a great job of implementing many initiatives that are designed to drive the long-term growth. What we're wrestling with and trying to figure out is we have 2 different brands at 2 different stages of where they're at in their development. \n And while we want to accelerate Dollar Tree, we want to position Family Dollar's transformation where it has the chance to grow. And by looking at them differently that might provide more acceleration for both brands long-term. Yes. A couple of great questions. Our biggest problem with multi-price right now is we can't keep it on the shelf. The consumer is responding to it. The consumer likes it. And I think it's going to be -- I don't think, I believe, truly believe it is going to be a very powerful piece in our ongoing future. \n You will see, as we move through the calendar year, as you guys know, we have to buy multi-price products, seasonal product more than a year in advance as we get into the holidays, you're going to see more multi-price show up on the discretionary side. I am pretty positive for the first time, we'll have an inexpensive Christmas tree in our stores that will probably have Christmas lights that will go with all the Christmas decorations we sell. \n In regards to consumables, multi-price points, again, are driving what's going on with our consumable share. And what we are committed that we are not raising the price or introducing like items we are bringing in different SKUs, which broadens the appeal of the assortment to the consumer. So with -- the first part of the question is, we see traffic increase in the multi-price stores to the tune of about approximately 3%, and we also see the ticket goes up about 55 bps. And again, it's soon. Again, I want to come back to, we're building a new muscle. I would look at you and say, off the top of my head, I'm guessing the old retailer in me. 50% of the stores are probably outperforming our expectation, maybe 25% are right on it and 25% have opportunities. And I think what's important on the promotion thing is that Jeff is in my office every Monday asking me what's going on in the promotional landscape, we have seen nothing irrational at this time. And I think that's really important. \n And what we are seeing is maybe incremental movements on CSD, soda pop and 2-liter pop. And that is a very easy traffic driver. But I always remind everybody I talk to, we have to not confuse marking down stale inventory with promotional activity. And I think that's really, really important. So stable environment, I would say it's not irrational and maybe CSD. Yes. Chuck, again, a couple of great questions. First one, I'll take. We have grown up in an environment in this company where everything is the same price point, so it doesn't matter where it goes, and it doesn't matter what the customer does with the product if they decide they don't want it. \n Now what we have to do is -- and what we're doing is we're introducing the multi-price SKUs into the category that they belong in. We're not just putting them in the center of the store. So you have to create a section, quite frankly, that bears prices, so the consumer knows how much they are. And when the consumer changes their mind, that product has to get back into the right spot on the shelf. And that's all about teaching our associates how to handle that product in regards to stocking it and then what to do with it when they condition the store. \n Now it's a very comparable discipline but it's not something that we've had over the years. We're doing all kinds of things to manage that. We put a shelf label literally on the outside of the case that allows the associate to put the product on the shelf, put the shelf tag on the shelf. But believe it or not, we also have to teach the people in the warehouse when they pull the item, they had to pull the right item because they're used to pulling 1 item that has the same price and in regards to the store's inventory, it stays true. But now the difference is if they're pulling a multi-price point item, it has to get there as it was supposed to be selected. Yes, I'll take the shrink question, if that's okay.  I think the efforts we've put in place for the first time, I can honestly say the shrink trends that we have, why they still are not good they're not getting away from us anymore. We're definitely tracking in the right direction. But I want to reinforce, shrink is still a problem, but it's not deteriorating like it was last year. We feel very good with the initiatives we've put in place. I also think it's fair to say that we were ahead on the shrink curve that we were calling it out and we were taking steps that people now are taking around us. \n Our self-checkout exposure is basically nothing. So we don't have to revisit that. We have started eliminating high-shrink SKUs. We started that about a year ago. And we've also placed things behind the check stand counters where we can control them. So I'm pleased we are not out of the woods, but at least I can tell you that it has stabilized. Yes. There's a lot there. Let me see if I can distill it down to just a couple of elements. The first DC that we rolled out was Matthews, North Carolina. It was a Family Dollar DC -- it's 1 in which previously they were delivering to the store off of pallets. So now we're doing it off of rotacarts. \n What we're actually seeing is improved delivery time on low time, which is what we were anticipating. We are also seeing a level of reduced damages, as you had mentioned, is the way that this product is being handled. And we're also seeing a higher level of associate sort of engagement and satisfaction, recognizing that it is helping to improve the way that they do their jobs. \n The next DC that we just really kicked off is here in Chesapeake. It's a Dollar Tree DC we're seeing a nice once again, reduction in unload times. It's allowing us now to get product to the shelf quicker and to basically fulfill some of the outs that we have on the shelf. But overall, the in-store in-stocks are improving as well as the DC service levels to these stores. So I'll let you handle the first part of the question. The second part of the question, it's too soon to know that. I'd like to stay away from that for now, if that's appropriate. Go ahead. Yes. So our investment-grade rating is an important element of our overall sort of financial policy, if you will. We believe that it's too early to get out ahead of ourselves as to what a structure may be or the ultimate outcome of the strategic review. But we believe that given the underlying business, the power of the cash flows generated by this business, the growth -- and quite honestly, how we basically execute our capital allocation is all in line with keeping us in an investment-grade level. Thank you all for taking your time to talk to us today and look forward to catching up down the road."

            "name": "Jeffrey Davis",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning. I will start by discussing our first quarter results, after which I'll provide comments on our Q2 and fiscal 2024 outlook. Where applicable, I will focus on our adjusted results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in our earnings release.  \n Let's begin by looking at the business on a consolidated basis. Net sales increased by 4.2% to $7.6 billion. Adjusted operating income was $436 million, a 3% decrease from last year. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 45 basis points reflecting a 30 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 75 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin improvement came from lower freight costs, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and elevated shrink. Adjusted SG&A increased primarily from temporary labor for Dollar Tree's multi-price rollout, higher depreciation and amortization and sales deleverage. Adjusted Q1 SG&A this year exclude $17.5 million of severance and other store closure costs and a $2.5 million reversal of a legal accrual. Q1 last year excluded a $30 million legal accrual.  \n Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 23.3%. Adjusted net income was $312 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.43.  \n Moving to our business segment results. Dollar Tree's net sales increased 5.9% to $4.2 billion. Operating income decreased 3% to $522 million. Operating margin decreased 110 basis points, driven by a 10 basis point increase in gross margin offset by a 120 basis point increase in SG&A rate.  \n Gross margin improved primarily from lower freight costs. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and elevated shrink. SG&A expenses increased primarily due to temporary labor for the multi-price conversions, higher depreciation and amortization and sales deleverage.  \n Family Dollar's net sales increased by 2% to $3.5 billion. Adjusted operating income was $51 million, a 32% increase from last year and adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points. The increase was all attributable to gross margin as the adjusted SG&A rate was flat at 23.7%. Gross margin increased primarily from lower freight, partially offset by product cost increases and an unfavorable sales mix. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Inventory decreased by 2% or $103 million. On a related note, in the quarter, we recorded a $70 million loss related to the book value of inventory destroyed at our Marietta distribution center and a $47 million loss related to property and equipment destruction. Given our expansive scale and breadth of operations, our insurance policies include significant property and inventory coverage above cost. Based on the catastrophic nature of this event, we expect these losses to be fully offset by insurance recoveries. As our recorded losses were fully offset by the insurance receivable, there was no net impact to the first quarter P&L.  \n With cash and cash equivalents of $618 million and long-term debt of $3.4 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our bank-defined leverage at quarter end stood at approximately 2.3x, which continues to underpin our investment-grade credit worthiness. Regarding cash flow, we generated $696 million from operating activities compared to $752 million last year. Capital expenditures were $472 million in the quarter versus $350 million last year reflecting accelerated new store openings and ongoing investments in growth and other initiatives. Notwithstanding the higher CapEx spending, we generated $224 million in free cash flow in the quarter compared to $402 million last year. Consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, after investing in the growth of our business, we returned $310 million to our shareholders by repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $122 per share.  \n At quarter end, we had approximately $1 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. \n Now let me provide some perspective on our second quarter and full year expectations. Our current outlook reflects the following: we expect to incur additional operating expenses related to the loss of our Marietta DC. The EPS impact of incremental transportation and other costs is estimated to be approximately $0.10 in Q2 and approximately $0.20 to $0.30 on a full year basis. As more information on the costs associated with this disruption becomes available, we may revisit this outlook in subsequent quarters. The expected impact of freight, shrink, mix, and SNAP on our full year adjusted EPS outlook remains consistent with the expectations we outlined last quarter.  \n Additionally, given the relatively low level of our freight volume that is subject to spot rates, we believe our exposure to recently observed volatility in the global shipping markets is limited and may be partially offset by favorable domestic carrier cost. With that as a background, for the second quarter, we expect net sales will be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion based on a comparable net sales growth in the low single digits for the enterprise, 2% to 4% for Dollar Tree segment and approximately flat for the Family Dollar segment. Adjusting for the stores that were closed as part of the portfolio optimization. We expect second quarter net sales for the Family Dollar segment to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. We expect adjusted EPS will be in the range of $1 to $1.10, which reflects the incremental operating expense associated with the loss of the Marietta DC.  \n For the full year, we still expect net sales to be in the range of $31 billion to $32 billion. Although at this point in time, we think we are more likely to be in the lower half of that range. We still expect comparable net sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the enterprise, the mid-single digits for Dollar Tree segment and the low single digits for the Family Dollar segment. Adjusting for stores closed as part of the portfolio optimization, we expect full year net sales for Family Dollar to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $6.50 to $7, again, reflecting the incremental operating expenses associated with the loss of Marietta.  \n Our outlook for Q2 in the fiscal year does not include any severance or additional incremental costs related to the portfolio review or related workforce reductions. It also excludes any future share repurchases. In the interest of time, I will direct you to our supplemental financial presentation, which is available on our IR website for the remaining details that support our current guidance.  \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. Just to maybe add a couple more points on the multi-price before going into longer-term profitability. On the multi-price, we mentioned that we had roughly 10% of the stores that have been converted to the in-line conversion. That happened over the course of the first quarter those stores are still ramping up. We will still continue to roll that out for another 2,000 stores in the rest of the year that ramp-up will give us some additional sort of tailwind, if you will.  \n On top of that, our comps, I don't know if you've noticed, and you probably have by looking at some of the things that we've published before, but our comps actually get to be a little softer in comparison in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year with the second quarter being our most stringent sort of compare.  \n The second part of your question, I believe, was with respect to how we're thinking about the long-term profitability of the enterprise and the brand. And we continue to be very encouraged by what we're seeing across both banners. The multi-price offering is allowing us to drive sales and volumes to drive greater profitability.  \n We continue to deliver from a standpoint of higher freight cost. We believe that there's opportunity across the Family Dollar brand to continue to drive greater gross margins as we continue to drive continued improvement in private label as well as the OTC and HBA. The combination of these things will allow us to drive greater gross profit dollars in the organization as we continue to drive greater discipline in our expenses along the way. So the outlook that we have for the year, we feel very confident in.  \n There's the opportunity to manage through some of this. So at this point, we really don't have any additional outlook considerations to provide other than the fact that we continue to remain on the numbers that we've given you so far. I think that covers it. So Matt, the guidance that we gave of 2% to 4% comp for the Dollar Tree banner coming out of Q1, we're in line with that guidance that's the reason why we've provided it. As we came out of that Easter period, and we had mentioned in our prepared remarks that in the absence of 8 to 10 day period, we actually pretty much through the course of the quarter, had a comp that was pretty reflective of a mid-single-digit comp -- I'm sorry, a low to mid-single-digit comps. So I think we're still in line with that as we move into Q2. Let's see if I can take a few pieces of that. Some of this, of course, we aren't in a position to share, but I can tell you that as you look at the remaining portfolio of stores, you still have a sort of a distribution of profitability across those stores at a much higher level than what you would have had before we closed the nonperforming stores. \n We had already indicated also that for the year, you should expect about $0.15 of additional profitability -- increased profitability coming from those closed stores and $0.30 of EPS on an annualized basis. Our leases that we enter into are normally somewhere between 5 to 10 years on average. At any one point in time, approximately 10% to 12% of those leases are being renewed on an annual basis. And that's about what I can really share with you at this point with respect to the lease obligations. I had just 1 other point. with multi-price, as we're looking at those stores that have had this in-line conversion, the mix of discretionary and consumables is more in line with what we would have seen historically with a heavier balance on discretionary than consumables. So we like that balance in that the multi-price is not only driving consumables, but it's also lifting the discretionary basket also. And look, we're definitely seeing the customer right now buying a little bit more on promotion. And it's not that there is more promotional activity, but what the customer is actually buying is items on promotion. And then, Chuck, with respect to the SG&A, margin deleverage, if you will. This is really 3 components. You called out the temporary labor was absolutely the largest component. The second component was higher depreciation and the third component was just sort of deleverage as a result of the lower comp. The 1 thing to recognize with the temp labor in the first stores that we opened up. There's a learning curve as to the -- how to go about it the number of crews that were actually allocated, how working with the store leadership teams. \n We continue to make progress on that in the subsequent stores that we're rolling out. So sort of the initial headwind that we had in the first quarter here, we would expect that to moderate over time. But as we had mentioned earlier, we definitely thought that the impact of using this third-party labor to do the in-line conversions was going to cost us approximately $0.23 of EPS for the year. Yes, just to put maybe a little bit of finer point on it. Our expectation for the first half of the year was that we were going to have about $0.30 to $0.35 of headwind across shrink and mix and that was predominantly going to be on mix. What we're seeing is that our performance is in line with that. We're actually seeing some slight improvement against it, but we're still early in the year. So as Rick has said, the investments that we were making -- and we did a lot of that on the Family Dollar side. First is a proof of concept and now growing some of those self-help opportunities across the Dollar Tree banner also. \n As it relates to gross margin, the gross margin pressure really from Dollar Tree was really more as a result of consumable mix by not having that discretionary Easter complement in our overall performance for the quarter is what really put pressure on the gross margin. \n On the Family Dollar side, very healthy improvement in gross margins overall of 40 basis points. So notwithstanding the impact of Easter, we're very happy with where we're trending as it relates to our gross margins. And Michael, as we think about sort of the phasing of our overall EPS for the year, I appreciate your question. It really kind of can get bucketed into a couple of areas. From a top line perspective, we talked about multi-pricing the acceleration of that as we continue to roll out the in-line conversions. \n You also have shrink in mix is for us we believe will be more neutralized in the back half of the year than in the front half. And we -- once again, that $0.30 to $0.35 of EPS headwind was really on the first half. We also believe that from a SNAP perspective, while SNAP is still within our expectations. In the back half, we think that we may have some tailwinds as a result of the October cola adjustment that may be available -- will be available this question is how much. \n And then the last component is, if you remember last year, in the back half of the year, we had a couple of foot faults, if you will. We had an OTC recall that was about $0.05 of EPS. We had an accrual adjustment that we needed to make on general liability, very specifically around some of the claims that we're going back to pre-pandemic, that was around $0.17. \n And then last but not least, as we had mentioned, with the portfolio optimization, we are expecting a $0.15 EPS improvement. That is predominantly going to be in the back half of the year. So on balance, as a result of top line acceleration of revenue growth, and then some of the softer compares against some of these elements with respect to shrink and SNAP and then the last components are those foot faults, which we believe were onetime in nature."
