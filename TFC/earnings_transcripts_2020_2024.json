As a reminder, this event is being recorded and it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ryan Richards, Director of Investor Relations for Truist Financial Corporation.\nRyan Richards: Thank you, Abby, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, Kelly King; President and COO, Bill Rogers and CFO, Daryl Bible will highlight a number of strategic priorities and discuss Truist fourth quarter 2020 results. Chris Henson, Head of Banking and Insurance and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer, will also participate in the Q&A portion of our call. We are conducting our call today from different locations to help protect our executives and teammates. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP With that, I will turn it over to Kelly.\nKelly King: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call. We really appreciate that. You know, I would say overall, this quarter and this year are very good given the challenging environment that we faced. We had a continued focus on our strong culture, it's activating very, very well. We're executing well on our revenue synergies. We had really effective expense focus and we made appropriate investments for the future, and importantly, supported our team mates in difficult environment, and kept our clients and communities number one. Our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. And we think in the times we live in today, this is more important than ever. We focus on our mission, we focus on our values. I would point out to you that with regard to our values, ultimately we focus most of our attention on the happiness of our teammates. In the challenging environment that we face today, helping people get through the challenges they're living with at home and at work and all of the various difficulties that people are going through, finding happiness in this environment is a very, very important undertaking and we work hard to try to help that be possible for our teammates. If you're following along on the slides, let's go to Slide 5. I just wanted to point out that, you know it's nice to say -- pardon me, that you have a culture, it's nice to say you have an important purpose, but is more important to live it. So I just want to point out a few of the things that we have done that I'm proud of in terms of living our purpose. You know that during the course of the year, we launched our Seeds of Hope program where we helped our teammates  with money to grow, [Indecipherable] do little projects, little things to help people in need. We launched our Truist One Team theme -- fund, our Home Page program. Our Truist Cares program was very effective where we invested over $50 million to meet the immediate long-term needs of our communities, our clients and our teammates. We provided over $100 million in special COVID support for our teammates, and 750,000 client accommodations; $13 billion in PPP loans, which funded -- helped for more than 80,000 companies and created also -- or protected about 3 million jobs. And we did 355 small to medium sized grants in our communities. I'm very proud of our $60 billion three-year community benefits program. I would say to you we are ahead of the time schedule in terms of making those investments. We supported those who are historically underrepresented through a $780 million commitment, that in turn include $40 million in helping establish an organisation called CornerSquare Community Capital, which is focused specifically on CDFIs in the minority space. And we're proud that we were able to invest $20 million over three years to support HBCUs and their students. On Slide 6, let's talk a little bit about where we are with the merger. I want to make a point of context for you with regard to how we think about our merger, because this is a bit different than most mergers. It's very different than the many, many mergers, I've been through in my career. We're not just putting two big companies together here cutting expenses and trying to improve profitability in the short term, rather we are building, what I call a new bank. We are building a bank based on the best of both -- from both organizations. Then in some cases just new systems and processes. For example in our commercial lending area, we've taken the very new and very best-in-class SunTrust in senior loan origination program and the BB&T back end system in terms of commercial loans. So combined, we have the best from both sides, and it's a classic case where two plus two equals five. We certainly could have picked one, it would have been cheaper, it would have been faster, but it would not have been better and it would not have been client-focused. Daryl is going to be talking to you about merger charges, another merger expenses a little later. I just want to emphasize that as he does that, remember that you have the normal merch that we called out early on in the announcement, that's normal signage and different systems that are just going away, they're being dry, they have no future benefit. They really are just a merger charge. And then we have these other investments which I call investments, because they are. They are investments in the future. They're making our organization better, it's client-focused, and while they will not be in our on-going long term run rate, these are with money to do little projects, little things that help people in need. We launched our Truist One team theme, found our home page program. Truist Cares program was very effective where we invested over $50 million to make immediate longer term need of our communities, our clients and our team mates. We provided about $100 million in special COVID for our team mates and 750,000 client accommodation for 13 billion in PPP loans. We funded help for more than 80,000 companies and created also are protective about three million jobs and we do 355 small medium type grants in our communities. I am very proud of our 60 billion three year community benefits program. I'd say to you we are ahead of the time schedule in terms of making those investments. We supported our representatives on our $780 million commitment and then it included 40 million in helping our from organization help [indiscernible] for our community, our capital reaches focus specifically on CFRs in the minority space and we're proud that we were able to invest $20 million over three years to support HBCUs and their peers. On Slide six, let's talk a little bit about where we are with the merger. I want to make a point of context for you with regard to how we think about our merger because it's a bit different than most of our deals, very different than the many, many mergers I've been through in my career. We're not just pretty tune big companies here together cutting expenses and trying to improve profitability in the short term. Rather we're building what I call a new bank. We're building a bank based on the best of both -- four both organizations and it's just new systems and processes. Like for example, in our commercial lending area, we've taken a very new and very best in class SunTrust and single loan origination program and BB&T back in system in terms of commercial loans. So combined, we have the advantage from both sides and it's basically the case where two plus two equals five. We saw the [indiscernible] one would have been cheaper and would have been faster but it would not have been better and would not have been client focused. Daryl is going to be talking to you about our merger charges, North American expenses a little later but this will emphasize that, remember that you have normal that we called out early on in the announcement that's normal sign in different systems that are just going away that have been drive future benefit, they really are just a merger short. And then we have investments which I call investments and investments in the future that make our organization better, it's client focused and while they will not be in our own going long-term run rate, these are investments that we make today to be sure that we have our agile very client focused organization as we go forward. While you'll see there are a number of accomplishments for 2020, I'll just point out a couple of those. Very importantly, we've made great progress in our culture, could not feel better about that. We established our brand and visual identity. We successfully merged first digital conversion we believe in terms of modern days in Truist Securities, activated our integrated relationship management process which was pivotal to our success. We did consolidate a 104 branches, leveraging our blended branch program which is innovative. Remember we did divest $2.3 billion loans and deposits, about 30 branches and there have been a lot of corporate backroom functions that have been integrated including audit, risk, legal, finance and others. And we importantly did a huge amount of work on appropriate job re-grading for our teammates. Daryl will comment with regard to some cost with regard to that, but this was a very important process in terms of making sure that our teammates through the year knew that we were going to do the right thing in terms of looking at the new responsibilities, establishing the right kind of job, and appropriate compensation. And we chose to make that retroactive for them during 2020, because it was the right thing to do. They would do the job, we just had -- not have a chance yet to properly raise a compensation and it has served us very, very well. In terms of '21, just a few points here. Everybody tends to focus on the core branch conversion, which as you know is in the first half of '22. That is very, very important, make no mistake. But look, there are huge amount of conversions and other activities going on in '20; '20 is a really big conversion year. We will complete our Wealth Brokerage conversion, we'll have our mortgage conversion, our sales force conversion, we'll be closing an additional 226 branches in the first quarter, we'll be implementing our digital first migration, supporting our T3 concept, in terms of meeting our clients' needs on a seamless basis, integrating technology in Truist to yield a high level of trust. And so, there are a lot of activities that are going on during the course of the year. But yes, definitely want you to be thinking, there's not much could be happening at Truist with regard to conversion for the first half of '22, because frankly most of the hard work will be done by the end of this year and then we'll actually execute on the final branch closures and conversions as we head into '22. Second, a few highlights with regard to our performance on Slide 7. I'm very excited about our revenue, our total taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5.5% annualized versus the fourth quarter. That was really driven by stable net interest income, strong fee income, especially in investment banking and trading income, strong insurance performance. Chris will talk about that, if we get questions in Q&A. I am very proud of five insurance acquisitions just in the fourth quarter alone, and we expect more activities as we head into '21. A very strong adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion. We had diluted earnings per share of $1.18, diluted return on average assets of 1.35% and a very strong adjusted return on average tangible common equity of 19.03%. So as you can see, we are well on the way to top performance and all the metrics that we projected when a deal was announced, which is kind of miraculous, you know, it has been two years, there's a lot been going on, but we are still tracking and doing really well in terms of hitting that top performance level of metrics as we expected that we -- that we would. Daryl is going to be commenting on some capital issues. I would point out to you that we -- our Board did approve over $2 billion in common stock repurchases, which will start in the first quarter. We have outstanding credit quality performance, much better than expected, and our common equity Tier 1 is exactly right on 10% which is what we had projected a couple of years ago. On Slide 8, I'll just point out to you the unusual items for this quarter, and you can see that we have the regular merger charges, and as I related to earlier the incremental operating expenses are not in the long term run rate and they equated to $0.28 drive with regard to a GAAP versus adjusted. So that's a quick look at the early highlights. I mean, I'll turn it to Bill for some focus on some key areas, Bill?\nBill Rogers: Great. Thank you, Kelly and good morning everybody. As Kelly just noted, Truist is the first large bank merger in the digital age. And with that in mind, we determined it was really imperative that our clients began experiencing an enhanced digital platform this year. And this is demonstrated on page 9. While our foundation is two leading digital experiences, we're going to accelerate the delivery of features like personalized financial insights, AI-driven chat bots, other client-centric enhancements. We're going to pilot this in both platforms in the second quarter and then we'll begin migration in waves in the third quarter and complete full migration to premier Truist experience for our digital clients by year end, sort of emphasizing Kelly's point of how much has been done this year. As you can see on page 10, we are experiencing excellent digital adoption and usage from our clients. So for the 12 months through November, we experienced a 26% increase in digital sales, 12% growth in active mobile users, 22% increase in mobile check deposits and a 5% increase in statement suppression. I think all would speak to increased digital adoption. This is an area where we're already seeing the benefits from our investment and on the right side, we show some recent enhancements. So for instance, the SunTrust business online and mobile experience incorporates significant updates and it was built in-house to give us more control of the app's functionality and performance long-term. The heritage award winning BB&T U platform now provides insights to help clients better manage new spending and behaviors including an end of month cash flow analysis and enhanced notifications, just to name a few, and very consistent with our whole Q3 premise. You know, this is a prime example of what Kelly talked about with best of both. Using BB&T U client driven front end at a more flexible agile heritage SunTrust driven back end, this clearly positions us I think really well for the future. We believe initiatives such as these underscore our commitment to improve the lives of our clients and demonstrate our investment effectiveness. So let's turn to page 11. We experienced further decline in balances across most loan categories in the face of continued economic uncertainty and elevated liquidity. Average total loans decreased $7.6 billion, largely attributable to commercial loan balances and ongoing run off in the residential mortgage portfolio. And commercial average balances declined $5.4 billion, primarily due to line paydowns and lower utilization. Paydowns activity reflected larger client's ability to obtain financing from capital markets and SunTrust securities is well positioned to assist them which you'll see later. Commercial balances were also impacted by $1.4 billion reduction in PPP loans and the transfer of $1 billion in assets to held for sale following our decision to exit a small ticket loan and lease portfolio. We experienced a rebound within our dealer floor plan clients after bottoming in July due to OEM supply chain disruptions, dealer floor plan balances have steadily improved as new core inventories were replenished. We also saw growth in mortgage warehouse lending and government finance. Commercial activity remains bifurcated as a whole with a greater share coming from large and medium sized companies than from small businesses. And consumer average balances decreased $2.2 billion, this was largely due to seasonality and refinance activity that resulted in lower residential mortgage, residential home equity and direct loan balances. Average balances in our indirect auto portfolio increased $1.1 billion. Loan production was really strong as vehicle sales rebounded especially for us in the prime segment. Overall, we've remained cautiously optimistic. We're hopeful that the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with additional government stimulus will increase visibility, revive confidence and support the economic recovery, all of which will be essential for loan growth. We are extremely well positioned in businesses and markets that we will believe will most benefit from this. So let's continue on page 12 to look at deposits. Deposit trends remain favorable during the quarter. Growth was robust and broad-based supported by a combination of seasonal inflows and ongoing growth resulting from pandemic related client behavior. Average non-interest bearing and interest checking balances were each up over $3 billion, while money market and savings were $1.1 billion. Average time deposits decreased $4.3 billion primarily due to the maturity of wholesale negotiable CDs, and higher costs personal and business accounts. Importantly, we're able to achieve a strong level of deposit growth while maximizing the value proposition to clients outside of repaying. For instance, the average total deposit costs decreased three basis points to seven basis points and average interest bearing deposit costs declined four basis points to 11 basis points. So with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to discuss our financial performance for the quarter.\nDaryl Bible: Thank you, Bill and good morning everybody. Turning to Slide 13, in the fourth quarter, reported net interest margin decreased two basis points to 3.08% reflecting lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin was unchanged at 2.72%. Core margin benefited from higher yields on PPP payoffs, recognition of deferred interest on loans and lower funding costs offset by excess liquidity. Earning assets rose $3 billion primarily due to an increase in deposits, resulting in a modest improvement in net interest income, we partially hedged our exposure to rising rates by pay-fixed swaps to offset market risk associated with our investment security. The chart on the bottom left shows the increase in our asset sensitivity due to quarter positive growth, additional pay fix loss and the residential mortgage run off, which was partially offset by the growth in the investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 14, our integrated relationship management strategy is helping to improve fee income. The noninterest income increased $179 million through third quarter security gains of $104 million. We had record investment banking and trading income of $308 million due to strong activity in M&A and loan syndications, lower counterparty refers and improved trading profits. We also generated record commercial real estate income of $123 million driven by structured real estate transactions and strong production and sales activity at Grandbridge. Insurance grew 7% versus fourth quarter of '19 due to strong production and premium growth as well as acquisitions. Organic growth was 2.9%. If you exclude the Truist policy last year, organic growth was 4.9%. We completed five insurance acquisitions during the fourth quarter, which we expect will add more than $110 million in annual revenue and approximately $7 million in adjusted expense. Turning to Slide 15, noninterest expense increased $78 million reflecting a $99 million increase in merger cost. Adjusted noninterest expense rose $27 million due to higher professional fees for strategic technology projects and higher personnel expense. Personnel expense increased $50 million reflecting higher incentives related to strong revenue production and the impact of our job re-grading process which concluded late last year. Job regrading regarding in the fourth quarter catch up in personnel expense. Approximately $50 million of this was related to prior quarters. Through the effort, we were able to honor our commitment to establish jobs and rewards program and harmonizing all teammates in the combined framework. FTEs decreased 1300 during the quarter and were down 8% since the merger was announced. We closed 104 branches during the quarter, bringing the full year total to 149, net occupancy decreased $26 million benefitting from aggressive closures of non-branch facilities. Turning to Slide 16, as we said we are seeking the opportunity to build best of both franchise. This approach is harder than a typical acquisition, but we believe the benefit to our clients justify the effort. Since the merger was announced, we have incurred $1.2 billion of merger-related and restructuring expenses. These expenses have no future benefit and are not part of the post conversion run rate. We also incurred $725 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. These expenses do provide future benefit and are integral to building a best of both franchise. The incremental operating expenses are not part of future run rate and will end after the conversions in 2022. Based on our integration plan, we expect the merger related and restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion and total incremental operating expenses of approximately $1.8 billion. This resulted in a combined total charges of approximately $4 billion. Turning to Slide 17, strong credit performance was characterized by minimal increase in NPAs and an excellent loss experience resulting in lower provision expense. We saw favorable trends in problem loan formation as the criticized and classified loans decreased 8.4%. The provision of $177 million benefited from lower charge-offs and a modest reduction in reserves. Due to the decision to exit the small ticket loan and lease portfolio, the allowed coverage ratio remained strong at 7.15 times net charge-offs and 4.39 times nonperforming loans. Active accommodations were down significantly since the second quarter. Approximately, 97% of the commercial clients and 91% of the consumer clients who exited the accommodation program are current on their loans. Our exposure to COVID sensitive industry decreased 2.6% to $27.1 billion, or approximately 9% of outstanding loans. We also had the third lowest loss rate among peers in the latest CCAR test. We believe this outcome reflects prudent client selection and underwriting as well as diversification from the merger. Turning to slide 18, the allowance for credit losses decreased $30 million largely due to moving the $1 billion portfolio into held for sale. Our macro assumptions include, unemployment remaining fairly stable through mid-2021 and improving thereafter and GDP recovery in pre-COVID levels by late 2021. We also layer in qualitative adjustments for COVID related uncertainty. Continued improvement in the economic activity, less uncertainty, and stabilization of a criticized asset may process to release reserves in the coming quarters. Turning to slide 19. Our capital ratios were relatively stable with the CET1 ratio unchanged at 10%. We declared a common dividend of $0.45 per share and a dividend and total payout ratios of 49.4%. In December, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock starting in the first quarter. Our intention is to maintain an approximate 10% CET1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions, stock repurchases and changes in risk-weighted assets. For the first quarter, we expect to repurchase approximately $500 million. The board authorized other measures to optimize our capital position, including the redemption of the outstanding Series F and G preferred stock, and liquidity remained strong and we are prepared to meet the funding needs of our clients. Turning to Slide 20, this slide highlights our progress towards achieving the $1.6 billion in net cost saves. Our efforts to reduce third-party spend are ahead of expectations. We're now targeting 10% reduction in sourceable spend of $4.5 billion. In retail banking, we closed 149 branches in 2020. On a cumulative basis, we expect to close 800 branches by the 1st of 2022 including more than 400 branches by the end of 2021. We also expect to reduce our nonbranch footprint by approximately $4.8 million square feet through the combination of closures and downsizings. Through December 31, we reduced our nonbranch footprint by approximately 2.4 million square feet. So, we're roughly halfway through our goal. The remaining facilities will be rationalized during 2021. Cost saved from technology are highly dependent on core bank conversions because we can\u2019t decommission systems or data centers until the conversions are completed. The bottom of the slide less where we are making significant investments, we believe these investments are critical to delivering on our purpose and providing our catch-plus technology equals Truist approach to clients. Turning to Slide 21, the waterfall on the left shows how we did relative to our 2020 cost savings target. Our objective for 2020 was to achieve annualized fourth quarter net cost saves of $640 million, or 40% of the $1.6 billion target. This equates to the fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expense of $3.40 billion or less. We adjusted noninterest expense of $3.174 billion and exceeded our target including catch up and expenses related to job ratings, commissions on higher revenue and the non-qualified expenses which are substantially offsetting other income. If you exclude these items, adjusted noninterest expense would come in slightly below target. As you can see from this slide, we're maintaining our medium-term targets and reaffirming our cost saving targets for 2021 and 2022. For 2021, our targeted fourth quarter adjusted expense would be $2.940 billion excluding acquisitions. Now I will provide guidance for the first quarter expressed in changes from the prior quarter. While the environment remains fluid, we continue to see momentum in our businesses, which may enable us to outperform the guidance. The first quarter had fewer number of days and seasonally higher personnel cost. We expect taxable equivalent revenue to be down 3% to 5% as a result of fewer days and purchase accounting loss. We expect our reported net interest margin to be down two to four basis points based on less purchase accounting accretion and a change in the core margin. We expect core margin to be relatively stable with the exception of increased liquidity coming from the balance sheet, that could pressure the margin up to five basis points. Non-interest expense adjusted for merger cost and amortization is expected to be down 2% to 4%. We also anticipate net charge-offs in the range of 30 to 45 basis points. Overall, we had a strong quarter with exceptional revenue growth, good margin performance and expense management and strong asset quality. Now let me turn it back to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly, you're on mute.\nKelly King: Just to close, we have very few comments with regard to the Truist value proposition, which is to optimize our long-term total shareholder return really through a focus on strong capital, strong liquidity and diversification and intense client focus. We believe we have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. We are the sixth largest commercial bank in the United States. We have strong market share is five fast-growing MSAs throughout the Southeast and the Mid Atlantic area. We are uniquely positioned to deliver best in class efficiency and returns while we continue to invest in the future. We're very committed as Daryl said to reaching our $1.6 billion of net cost savings. We have a really great mix of complementary businesses that allows us to expand our client base through our year old enhancement in revenue synergies. We have a very strong capital and liquidity position in sales, which positions us to be resilient as we go through very challenging times that we are experiencing. We are as I said earlier building a best-in-class new bank designed to be client purpose driven and resolutely committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. We believe our best days are here for tourists in these States of America. I'll turn it back over to Ryan.\nRyan Richards: Thank you, Kelly. Abby at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. \nJohn Pancari: Regarding the $1.8 billion in incremental operating expenses, could you just talk about that, like how that number has evolved versus your original expectation? I know it's the first time you're giving us that target. So how does that compare to where you originally expected and how has it evolved over time? And then can you give us a little bit more of your thought process behind it, in terms of, if we can continue to see upward pressure on that amount, or are you pretty confident in the $1.8 billion in that it's going to remain at that target? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah, John, thanks for that question. I would tell you when we were putting the transaction together in late '18 and we announced in early '19, we thought $2 billion was the merger and restructuring charges, and we're pretty much on target with that. As we continued to work on all the integrations and we saw the opportunity to really build the best in breed of what we could do with our F systems and technologies, we just knew that we would basically be having, I would call it a lot of technology projects on steroids all at once, and that this would be a really unusual time to have all that costs running through our expense structure. So that's really what we came up with. And we've been tracking it to date, so far, and we feel pretty good about the forecast that we have. We're almost at $2 billion in total when you combine both charges of both the merger and restructuring and the incremental. So we have about $2 billion to go over the next year and a half. But we believe it was for the right reasons and makes all the sense that it's going to help our clients and really produce good performance for our Company going forward.\nKelly King: So John, a way to think about that conceptually is that, that $1.8 billion is really as I think about it like our capital allocation for future benefits in terms of client focus and better systems and better processes. So it will flow through expenses. We will continue to report it too. Also you can think about it more in terms of an investment.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, separately on the -- on the branch and non-branch real estate reduction. I just want to confirm that those reductions that you're targeting and the savings that come from that, that is included in your targeted cost savings tied to the merger?\nDaryl Bible: Absolutely. Yes, [Speech Overlap]. So when we came up with the five buckets, you're talking about two of the buckets, I mean the retail branches we said originally would be between 700 and 800 branches, as you can see we're at the high end of that original estimate. That will be done by the first quarter of '22. And then on corporate real estate, even before COVID, when you put these two companies together, we have huge duplication all throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. So just going through and rationalizing that space, I will tell you COVID has helped us in a number of ways in that it's emptied out the buildings, so we can move quicker in the consolidation and my guess is, as we continue to make these combinations that we may actually exceed what we had originally estimated in real corporate real estate consolidations because of COVID and just the behaviors of people working at home.\nJohn Pancari: Yeah. Right, that was exactly what I was getting at, because I am assuming some of the corporate real estate reduction opportunity got bigger. You guys saw greater opportunity as COVID set in. So I was just wondering if that could present upside to your cost saving expectations if corporate real estate reduction can be more than you thought.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah, so we have a plan for where we are executing now in the $4.8 billion, once we complete that plan, I'm sure Kelly and Bill and Executive Leadership will reevaluate it and see if there is opportunity to do more in the future.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. All right, sorry about that. Yes, so I had a couple of questions. One, just on the integrated relationship management strategy, I'm wondering how that's progressing. The revenues are strong this quarter particularly in fees and so I just wanted to understand how much was the IRM helping to drive that result this quarter?\nKelly King: Well, Betsy that's a huge part of it, and I'll let Bill give you some deep color with regard to that, but this is a concept of really integrating the way we focus on the client. You know, many institutions focus on a siloed way in terms of products and different services, we don't do that. We focus on the whole needs of the client, and so we've developed this as IRM process we call it, Integrated Relationship Management, over really several decades. And it's very, very effective, very efficient because everybody owns a client. Everybody is focused on meeting all the needs of the clients all the time. But we're seeing spectacular early positive feedback in terms of how it's working especially between the community bank and CIG. Bill, you may want to comment on that.\nBill Rogers: Hey, Betsy. I mean, this is one of the really strong cultural alignments that Kelly and I talked about, when we first started talking about this merger, is this commitment to put the client first and create a culture and a structure that evolves from that. And we're seeing it. I mean, and the model is working. As Kelly noted, a couple of examples and the Investment Banking outperformance this quarter, in particular, I mean there was really just great contribution from our Commercial Community Bank and from our CRE and from our private wealth businesses. So that model of integrated relationship management is working. It's just been great adoption, great participation, really good cultural alignment. You see it in the insurance numbers, you see it in the Wealth numbers. So it's all part of this structure and focus. And we have -- we have lots of discipline around it. But the key is the cultural side. There are people committed to wanting to work together and work together towards a common goal to meet client needs and I'd say this quarter was probably one of the better examples of how the engine is really firing on all cylinders.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, all right, thanks. And I appreciate that. The fee -- fees really jumped out on the screen. I guess the follow-up question on the expense line here is around, you know, some of the core expense inflation outside of the cost saves, you've got merit increases, bolt-on acquisitions, investments for revenue growth, etc. I'm just wondering how investors should think about where the total expense dollars will likely land post the net cost saves, what kind of guidance can you help us with there? Thanks.\nKelly King: So Betsy, let me just mention in general, we have the itemized areas you've listed, but we are really focusing on expenses on a broader conceptual approach, we do in obvious. I mean, the obvious are, you know, as you got two of these, and you only need one and those kinds of things that's just going to happen. But we are heading into a period now where it's time for us to focus on optimization. It's time for us to focus on transformation or re-centralizing the business. Because so far what we basically have done is think about it as put two big banks together. Now, what we have -- and we get the -- we get less savings from that, just natural overlap. So, now we have the opportunity to re-conceptualize the business as we transform it post-COVID and all this going on with regard to the new digital world and there are enormous opportunities for us as we go through '21. So '21 is going to be an intense year of focus on expenses from the perspective of transforming our structures, so that we are doing the right things in terms of investments and expense allocations to meet the client's needs first, and we believe that will throw off positive benefits in terms of expenses.\nDaryl Bible: Betsy, what I would say in my prepared remarks, I gave for the fourth quarter of this year the $2.940 billion, now that excludes the merger and the restructuring charges, the incremental MOE expenses, amortization. And then I gave a call out on the expenses for the Insurance acquisitions of about $70 million adjusted expenses. So all of that will get carved out of that base. But when you look at like the job re-grading marketing considering that part of the investment, that's something that we\u2019re covering with our net saves.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. Let me talk about the timing of liquidity deployment this past quarter, obviously, securities went up a lot. It sounds like you had some of that. But what made you decide kinds now's the right time. We've seen the 10-year move up, but actually mortgage rates and I think rates on the types of securities that you would have bought were probably stable or down. And most people I think are expecting higher rates later this year. So what kind of drove you to deploy what seems like most of your excess liquidity this past quarter?\nDaryl Bible: So Matt, ideally, we would like to take this excess liquidity that we have and deploy it in loans, what we're seeing is that we just have a fair amount of payoffs in the PPP. But as businesses really come back and have a lot of momentum and start growing, as we get into the middle of latter half of \u201921, we really want to deploy that excess liquidity in lending. I would say that we decided to put some of that liquidity into the investment portfolio. We did that throughout the third quarter. We did partial heads up our hedges on them, basically to help with a mark-to-market on that. So when we added about $25 billion, $30 billion to the investment portfolio, we did have hedges on there about $20 million that we put on to help with the market risks that we have. So net-net, we feel good with what we've done. The real uncertainty on a go forward basis with all these new stimulus packages is, we could get potentially another $10 billion or $20 billion more liquidity into the balance sheet. I think we need to evaluate what we do with that excess liquidity whether we keep it at the Fed or invest it or ideally lend it out, which is the main primary objective.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then circling back on the incremental cost related to deal, obviously you\u2019ve been incurring these already and I think the first time which is getting a lot of attention, but how we see these on the other side right, so like you did increase the net cost saves and right size having the synergies even though it really seems like it will become, how will we see the payback of that incremental $1.8 billion if you can break that how somehow?\nKelly King: So these as I was describing are really investments, so think about this as we're building a whole new mortgage long delivery system. You will see the benefit of that in terms of -- in some cases just more efficient systems because they're newer, and the other is the effectiveness in terms of meeting client's needs. So we can -- for example in mortgage, you can do more mortgages because you're more efficient. You get more mortgage application because you have a better client experience. So it's just like, if your car has done a rundown and run out of 200,000 miles, you buy a new car, you make an investment, you see the benefit of that in terms of driving experiences, less breakdowns etc, etc. So it is an investment, that is the best way I can describe it to you to think about.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika, your line is open, please check your mute button.\nErika Najarian: Hi, thank you. My first question is on revenues. Kelly, you were very upbeat on the future of this Company and your peers were actually quite a bit on the future of economic growth. And I'm wondering as we think about going past the first quarter, how should we think about your base case for economic recovery relative to loan growth, which was -- well, your peers were surprisingly upbeat and also specific to you the insurance outlook?\nKelly King: Yeah, Erika, we are upbeat as well. I would say, and I'll take a second why I'm upbeat regarding the economy. This economic downturn is dramatically different than what we've all experienced in the past. If you take the money correction, it was about our commercial real estate bubble, 2000 was a technology bubble, 2008 was the residential real estate bubble. There was no bubble here. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the economy. In fact, we had ten years of robust growth, you know, have very, very low inflation, we just shut it off. That's important because we're not underlying impending issues that caused the economy to sputter. Now, if you kept it shut off for ten years, you have another issue, but given whether we ordered the vaccines, etc, we fully expect that you're most likely would see stronger snap back in the economy than most people expect. When we talked to our clients and prospects, they are really pretty upbeat. They are saying things like it's time to get on with it. We're ready to go, we're making investments and we're seeing that in terms of our robust pipeline of loan reversal activity. And so we are upbeat with regard to the economy. We think it will be slower in the first part, picking up steam as you head through the mid part, stimulus will have that summed, but mostly businesses and consumers feeling more confident. Look, when the vaccines are out there, I would say all, and as they become more widespread in terms of being injected, fear goes down, confidence goes up. People are ready to live again, people are ready to invest, are ready to run their businesses. So I fully expect by the time we head towards the fall and end of the year, you're going to be really surprised in terms of how robust this economy is. That will show up in terms of our commercial loan activity in a very big way. You're likely to see more residential loan growth than we would have expected in the slower economy and certainly you'll see in terms of our insurance activity as well. Let me just turn quick to Chris Henson and let him give you some color with regard to insurance that is very important.\nChris Henson: Thanks Kelly and Erika thank you for the question. So maybe just to sort of fourth quarter and maybe just the outlook to your point, one of the best quarters that we have had in some time and with all the drivers of organic growth are really kind of hitting, hitting on all cylinders, client retention has stabilized in and retail at north of 90% for the last eight months wholesale, really strong at 85%, we're really seeing the cause of the factors in the market. Standard carriers are pushing risk to the wholesale market, and we're benefiting from that. Pricing another element organic growth as strong as we're in the hardest market we've seen in two decades, rates are up in the industry, north of 7%. And it's anticipated that we'll continue to see some hardening and acceleration into \u201821. Our new business, new business in 2019 was up in the 12% to 13%. That was as good as we've seen and we hit COVID. We were kind of negative 4% to 6%, didn't know where the year was going to shake out. But this quarter, our new business was up 19.5% up 8% year-to-date, some of the best numbers I have ever seen. So that all led to an organic growth number that we reported 2.9% to like quarter, 4.3% year-to-date. But just to key in on one point Daryl made, I think it's really important. The 2.9% growth number was really negatively impacted by one-time MOE related piece of insurance that was booked for our MOE deal in Q4 \u201819. So if you exclude that noise, organic growth really would have been on a core basis 4.9%. In terms of output, we expect first quarter commissions to be up in the 10% range, we're moving from our third best quarter of the year to our second best and first, obviously uncertainties in COVID that impact the economy. But the outlet is really strong given accelerator pricing, exposure units in the business are holding. We're growing excess and surplus lines because of the shift that I mentioned in the standard cares of support retail pushing it to E&S. And we're really benefiting from that diversification. And the pricing momentum, you think about the markets digest and the COVID impacts, CAT losses. We had 30 storms this year, the most in history in any given year. And three of the largest years in history of CAT losses occurred in the last four years. So it's got upward pressure and then lower interest rates, which puts pressure on investment income for underwriters. So pricing up 7%, you're seeing examples of things like in excess of 12.5%, D&O up 11.5%, property was we had a lot of up 9%, up in all classes all accounts. So, looking forward, what we're expecting is, in first quarter, is somewhere around the 5% kind of organic growth rate number. And we think that elevated catastrophe level, low interest rates , all that's really going to keep it propped up. And Kelly mentioned acquisitions, we were able to close five in the fourth quarter, and we expect more in 2021, so really bullish about insurance going forward.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you. That was very helpful. My second question is a two-parter on expenses. Daryl, if you can maybe briefly describe, what\u2019s in that $1.8 billion number, that would assure your investors and it just doesn't linger in the run rate? I think everybody gets scared when they see personnel as a descriptor. And going back to Slide 21 as a follow-up question to that and a follow-up question to Betsy's question. What do we do with that 3.037 number that annualizes to 12.16 as we think about your 2023 run rate? Is that a base for the run rates that includes the savings plus the growth rate just help us think about -- how to think about that number for 2023?\nDaryl Bible: So, I'll start on the latter question first. So it's pretty simple. We basically gave you the guidance for fourth quarter of \u201821, which was a $2.940 billion, in there that excludes the restructuring, MOE, amortization and acquisitions. That said, so that's the number we're targeting to get for fourth quarter of \u201821. That's pretty simple. And then that will continue on in \u201822 when we get all the cost saves into the net $1.6 billion. Your other question on \u201921, what was the question again the first part?\nErika Najarian: Yes, if you can describe the types of expenses you're incurring in that $1.8 billion, yes, yes.\nDaryl Bible: Yes, it's the technology projects. And so the expenses that we can carve out, one-time cost like when we decommission something or something is put out of use, from that perspective has no future benefit. That's in the original merger and restructuring charges. But when you have developers going in and you have people going in with systems, and you have architects building out, you know our new [indiscernible]they're basically building a whole new Truist environment and technology. All those are real costs, we're doing all these technology costs all at once. All that has future benefit, we would typically not carve that out as merger and restructuring. It's basically just the combination of doing a lot of technology projects all at once. We just thought it was fair to call out because you would never really think of doing this all at once if it wasn't for the merger. But as Kelly said, at the end of the day, we're going to have a much better client experience, we're going to have much better performance overall. And you should see the benefits of all these systems integrated by doing the best between each of the systems that I think you're having a lot of revenue and other synergies going forward.\nKelly King: Erika , keep in mind what Daryl emphasized, when you\u2019re doing this project you bring all those consultants in, but you also get them out. So with regard to consultants, we have a narrow front door and a very big back door. I'm going in the back door.\nErika Najarian: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on back book repricing dynamics, and how to think about that from here, for Legacy BB&T and other banks more broadly, we saw downward pressure on loan yields persists throughout the last SERP cycle despite having a steeper curve. Can you discuss whether that downward pressure on yields is a dynamic, you'd expect to persist throughout the remainder of this SERP cycle as well?\nDaryl Bible: Bill, I would say in a normal balance sheet structure that would make a fair amount of sense, what we have going on our balance sheet, remember, we have some purchase accounting, we have PPP, and all that, we actually saw our yields, you can see that on our tables, you can see that we actually had loan yields higher for those various reasons. That said, I would tell you the steepening of the curve, we are asset sensitive, we\u2019re asset sensitive across the curve, little bit more short in the longer-end. But as the yield curve shifts, we will benefit from that, 25 basis point steepening of a curve will basically give us two to three basis points in core margin. So it is a phenomenon, if you look at how things are going on and off on a pure basis actually look at credit spreads going on, our commercial credit spreads are going on maybe three or four basis points higher than what they\u2019re coming off. And so I think all that is relatively good from that perspective.\nKelly King: Yes, let me just add to Daryl\u2019s point, that's also a business mix and focus issue. So what would be traditionally a different back book look, on a forward basis as Daryl noted, I mean we\u2019re seeing improvement in margin that has to do with focus type of relationships, value that we're adding all those type things, and as he noted, you see that particularly in the commercial side.\nBill Carcache: Understood. That's really helpful. And just as a quick follow-up on that same question, to the extent that PPP 1.0, and then 2.0 are going to be sort of contributing to the NIM in this SERP cycle, can you discuss how long you'd expect those tailwinds to persist through \u201921 and then not \u201922 or would they carry into \u201822 as well?\nKelly King: You want to call that?\nDaryl Bible: Yes, Chris, you want to start this one? And I'll finish off?\nChris Henson: Sure. Yes, we do obviously plan to participate in Round 2, probably in the neighborhood of $3 billion or so. We see most in Round 1 playing out through \u201921 and Round 2 probably coming in, the first half of the year and then rolling out the back half of the year. Really hard to call exactly when what quarter exactly that all is going to flow out. But to answer your question that I would say 90 plus percent of it should be gone by the end of \u201821.\nDaryl Bible: The thing I would just add to that Bill is that it has a huge impact obviously on core margin depending on when the forgiveness happens and it could be anywhere from three to five basis points depending on the amount that actually happens in any given quarter. One thing to note, round two is really focused on more smaller loans. So those actually drive higher fees, but our average fee on round one was about 2.7. Our estimate -- this is just an estimate because it's just now starting to roll out, you might see north of 5% fees on round two. We'll have less volume, but it will also have a huge impact on those as well.\nKelly King: And just to give you a sense, we've invited 100% of round one through the path of forgiveness, but they submit information at different times. We've received and proposed on the SBA about 40% of that to this point. So some of the timing is really determined by the timing of the client provide the information.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: I was wondering Daryl, you could provide us a little more color on that commentary you gave about the first quarter revenue outlook, I believe you said down 3% to 5% FTE. Can you help us understand just what, Chris gave some color on insurance but kind of bifurcation between what you expect out of NII and fees and what the drivers would be especially in those other fee areas in addition to insurance, thanks?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah, I'll be happy to do that. So when you look at margin because we have the difference between our reported margin and core margin, we are going to have less over time accretive yield going into our margin. Now that's volatile, I would say that that could be down anywhere from two to four basis points unless accretive yield that impacts reported margin on a quarterly basis. So that trends down, it's just how much is down kind of goes back and forth from that. From a core margin perspective, our core margin is actually holding up really well. We've done really well in the past couple of quarters with that. The uncertainty we have is that how much more liquidity when you get into the balance sheet and liquidity and the balance sheet pressure to core margin. If we decide to invest in equity and securities, it gives us a little bit more NII, we view it fairly basically just trend a lot of NII. So we estimate those decisions as we go forward, but depending on how much liquidity we gain with the packages, core margin, it could be a little bit volatile. I think you have to move -- shift to net interest income and focus on net interest income and what the impacts are until that in front of there. On the fee side, I would just tell you that the business has had a lot of momentum. Insurance always is very strong in the first quarter achieving the strong quarter, but if you look at those areas in investment banking and trading, huge pipelines they had build in the fourth quarter. Kelly is right with the economy. He could have a great quarter in Joe's world and whilst they have a lot of momentum, they're adding more accounts in our retail area add traction, our community bank commercial actually is growing commercial loans and you look at the detail, I don\u2019t know if Bill or Chris want to comment on the momentum we got on the revenue on those businesses.\nChris Henson: If we look at things like pipelines going forward and production in the fourth quarter, we have a reason to be optimistic that's against a headwind though of PPP paydowns and utilizations being at uniquely low level. So I think the things that we can control production pipelines are doing well and then I think we'll see the benefit of that over time whether that manifest itself in first quarter, second, third or fourth will be dependent upon all the things that will build confidence and market acceptance of where we are.\nBill Rogers: I might just add opportunities we're seeing really for growth, auto is very strong right now. We were up about a $1 billion in average balances. We see that continue into the first part of the year and warehouse lending because of the environment is also very, very strong.\nKen Usdin: And just one more follow-up on that 29.40 number Darrell, so is that -- it seems like to be a real landing point that you're targeting before the $70 million quarterly version of the $70 million of insurance ads just to get to the base. Without that 2940 also be inclusive of incentive comp or core underlying cost inflation. It's an absolute goal that you're trying to get around that number before we have the acquisitions and other stuff?\nDaryl Bible: Our fee income is still strong and all that and I have to tell you it's meaningful and have to carve it out like we did this past quarter that would be actually great story to tell you. So we will continue to try to carve out when we think it makes sense to carve out that variable comp. Obviously, we're a dynamic company and things remain, but just to be sure we're doing, but everybody understands, we're not changing our commitment. We're back on our way from the $1.6 billion that we made in February '19. We're going to get those cost savings,\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Just back on the merger savings $1.6 billion year-over-year reiterating that net number that's pretty clear, you have 40% of the savings already and only 12% of the branch closures you expect to exceed on the non-branch footprint part. So why not increase that, actually what would it take to increase that estimated $1.6 billion net or have you already increased the growth merger saving number what you haven\u2019t given to us and reinvesting some of the proceeds and does that all add up to part of the operating leverage in 2021 or not, you didn\u2019t quite guide for the year, thanks.\nKelly King: So Mike you're really right, the immediate parts, we're just trying to anchor on the $1.6 billion. We're not trying to hold out what we think is possible in terms of beating that but some of the things I talked about in terms of and we can have more branch closures than we've anticipated. We're not predicting that at this moment, but that's certainly a possibility. We certainly are going to be intensely focused on expense optimization and there are immediate opportunities for duplication across the enterprise areas that we can tend to invest in and reduce ongoing expense run rate. So the $1.6 billion related to basically putting the two companies together. The other things we do more in terms of transformation and additional opportunities we find whether non-branch office space, we see that target, maybe we get a few more branches. We certainly are very optimistic in terms of -- and expect to focus on doing that. We just want to be clear about what we've said we can do and then hold out we can probably beat that.\nMike Mayo: With that using up my second question, in terms of the gross number, I know that you're investing a lot of that, is your growth number going higher as part of that net?\nKelly King: Go ahead Daryl.\nDaryl Bible: So I won't tell you we are investing more than what we originally sight, but we think these are the right investments that we're making in our people, technology, digital are all for the right reasons. So we are making more investments than what we originally thought. We haven't communicated that number publicly, but just now that we are going to get our net savings maybe more clear at some point but let us get the $1.6 first and right now we are making a lot of investments in the company as we're moving forward and you're seeing it in the results. Look at our revenues, look at our account growth that we're getting and we're doing really, really well in the midst of a lot of conversion, which would really distract a lot of businesses. We are performing at a very high level.\nMike Mayo: And then second question, a lot of talk about the -- lot of talk about insurance, and bringing in the big guns with my peer colleague my firm insurance count spoken with the insurance managers, I want to ask the question on my behalf, go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: So the one question I had, you guys posted 5% adjusted organic growth in the fourth quarter which seems like a pretty impressive number relative to some of the other companies that cover and then also given the impacts that we see from COVID on the industry, as you guide about 2021 and some of your other comments, it seems like growth will continue on an organic basis right to kind of should come in above that 5%. It is really just mainly expand there. And then also could you give us a sense of you guys a little bit different others obviously have good feel of wholesale and retail in your insurance business and the organic front both of those businesses as once they've been outperforming versus the other or are they consistent?\nChris Henson: Thanks for the question, this is Chris. You're right, we did finish around 5% and based on what I see now, I think around 5% would be certainly a good number for call it the first half of next year. We call it the last half when we give the quarter in or so. So we feel very, very good about it but I must tell you if pricing holds and I believe that it will and if the economy does begin to turn via vaccinations getting pushed out to the country and we're able to see then better new business growth as a result, some example of what we saw in the fourth quarter, could it be better, I think it's possible that it could. So I think the opportunity really kind all the cylinders have opportunity to move. I do think that growth is going to be dependent upon what happens with COVID and the economy and kind of get all that going, but certainly we do get vaccinated out stimulus first half of the year, I think it bodes well for organic growth in that business for sure and your question about is the margin better than one than the other, strategically as a bank, the reason we want exposure to both, if we want to bank, it probably wouldn\u2019t matter as much, but what we're really interested in is for this business to provide good downside protection when credit markets are challenging and you can see it this year this past year, 4.3% organic growth for the year I think is pretty solid given the backdrop. And the reason we do that is because the wholesale and retail is going to operate in difference to each other. So you're going to depending on whether you're in hard in soft market, one it is going to help balance the other that we're interested in the combination of the growth there. So certainly a little bit better contribution from wholesale today than retail, but they're making nice contribution.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Ryan Richards for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Richards: Okay. That complete the Q&A portion of our call. Thank you, Abby and thank you everyone for joining us today. I apologize to those with questions that we didn't have time to get to. We will reach out to you later today and we wish you all the best. Goodbye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly King",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call. We really appreciate that. You know, I would say overall, this quarter and this year are very good given the challenging environment that we faced. We had a continued focus on our strong culture, it's activating very, very well. We're executing well on our revenue synergies. We had really effective expense focus and we made appropriate investments for the future, and importantly, supported our team mates in difficult environment, and kept our clients and communities number one. Our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. And we think in the times we live in today, this is more important than ever. We focus on our mission, we focus on our values. I would point out to you that with regard to our values, ultimately we focus most of our attention on the happiness of our teammates. In the challenging environment that we face today, helping people get through the challenges they're living with at home and at work and all of the various difficulties that people are going through, finding happiness in this environment is a very, very important undertaking and we work hard to try to help that be possible for our teammates. If you're following along on the slides, let's go to Slide 5. I just wanted to point out that, you know it's nice to say -- pardon me, that you have a culture, it's nice to say you have an important purpose, but is more important to live it. So I just want to point out a few of the things that we have done that I'm proud of in terms of living our purpose. You know that during the course of the year, we launched our Seeds of Hope program where we helped our teammates  with money to grow, [Indecipherable] do little projects, little things to help people in need. We launched our Truist One Team theme -- fund, our Home Page program. Our Truist Cares program was very effective where we invested over $50 million to meet the immediate long-term needs of our communities, our clients and our teammates. We provided over $100 million in special COVID support for our teammates, and 750,000 client accommodations; $13 billion in PPP loans, which funded -- helped for more than 80,000 companies and created also -- or protected about 3 million jobs. And we did 355 small to medium sized grants in our communities. I'm very proud of our $60 billion three-year community benefits program. I would say to you we are ahead of the time schedule in terms of making those investments. We supported those who are historically underrepresented through a $780 million commitment, that in turn include $40 million in helping establish an organisation called CornerSquare Community Capital, which is focused specifically on CDFIs in the minority space. And we're proud that we were able to invest $20 million over three years to support HBCUs and their students. On Slide 6, let's talk a little bit about where we are with the merger. I want to make a point of context for you with regard to how we think about our merger, because this is a bit different than most mergers. It's very different than the many, many mergers, I've been through in my career. We're not just putting two big companies together here cutting expenses and trying to improve profitability in the short term, rather we are building, what I call a new bank. We are building a bank based on the best of both -- from both organizations. Then in some cases just new systems and processes. For example in our commercial lending area, we've taken the very new and very best-in-class SunTrust in senior loan origination program and the BB&T back end system in terms of commercial loans. So combined, we have the best from both sides, and it's a classic case where two plus two equals five. We certainly could have picked one, it would have been cheaper, it would have been faster, but it would not have been better and it would not have been client-focused. Daryl is going to be talking to you about merger charges, another merger expenses a little later. I just want to emphasize that as he does that, remember that you have the normal merch that we called out early on in the announcement, that's normal signage and different systems that are just going away, they're being dry, they have no future benefit. They really are just a merger charge. And then we have these other investments which I call investments, because they are. They are investments in the future. They're making our organization better, it's client-focused, and while they will not be in our on-going long term run rate, these are with money to do little projects, little things that help people in need. We launched our Truist One team theme, found our home page program. Truist Cares program was very effective where we invested over $50 million to make immediate longer term need of our communities, our clients and our team mates. We provided about $100 million in special COVID for our team mates and 750,000 client accommodation for 13 billion in PPP loans. We funded help for more than 80,000 companies and created also are protective about three million jobs and we do 355 small medium type grants in our communities. I am very proud of our 60 billion three year community benefits program. I'd say to you we are ahead of the time schedule in terms of making those investments. We supported our representatives on our $780 million commitment and then it included 40 million in helping our from organization help [indiscernible] for our community, our capital reaches focus specifically on CFRs in the minority space and we're proud that we were able to invest $20 million over three years to support HBCUs and their peers. On Slide six, let's talk a little bit about where we are with the merger. I want to make a point of context for you with regard to how we think about our merger because it's a bit different than most of our deals, very different than the many, many mergers I've been through in my career. We're not just pretty tune big companies here together cutting expenses and trying to improve profitability in the short term. Rather we're building what I call a new bank. We're building a bank based on the best of both -- four both organizations and it's just new systems and processes. Like for example, in our commercial lending area, we've taken a very new and very best in class SunTrust and single loan origination program and BB&T back in system in terms of commercial loans. So combined, we have the advantage from both sides and it's basically the case where two plus two equals five. We saw the [indiscernible] one would have been cheaper and would have been faster but it would not have been better and would not have been client focused. Daryl is going to be talking to you about our merger charges, North American expenses a little later but this will emphasize that, remember that you have normal that we called out early on in the announcement that's normal sign in different systems that are just going away that have been drive future benefit, they really are just a merger short. And then we have investments which I call investments and investments in the future that make our organization better, it's client focused and while they will not be in our own going long-term run rate, these are investments that we make today to be sure that we have our agile very client focused organization as we go forward. While you'll see there are a number of accomplishments for 2020, I'll just point out a couple of those. Very importantly, we've made great progress in our culture, could not feel better about that. We established our brand and visual identity. We successfully merged first digital conversion we believe in terms of modern days in Truist Securities, activated our integrated relationship management process which was pivotal to our success. We did consolidate a 104 branches, leveraging our blended branch program which is innovative. Remember we did divest $2.3 billion loans and deposits, about 30 branches and there have been a lot of corporate backroom functions that have been integrated including audit, risk, legal, finance and others. And we importantly did a huge amount of work on appropriate job re-grading for our teammates. Daryl will comment with regard to some cost with regard to that, but this was a very important process in terms of making sure that our teammates through the year knew that we were going to do the right thing in terms of looking at the new responsibilities, establishing the right kind of job, and appropriate compensation. And we chose to make that retroactive for them during 2020, because it was the right thing to do. They would do the job, we just had -- not have a chance yet to properly raise a compensation and it has served us very, very well. In terms of '21, just a few points here. Everybody tends to focus on the core branch conversion, which as you know is in the first half of '22. That is very, very important, make no mistake. But look, there are huge amount of conversions and other activities going on in '20; '20 is a really big conversion year. We will complete our Wealth Brokerage conversion, we'll have our mortgage conversion, our sales force conversion, we'll be closing an additional 226 branches in the first quarter, we'll be implementing our digital first migration, supporting our T3 concept, in terms of meeting our clients' needs on a seamless basis, integrating technology in Truist to yield a high level of trust. And so, there are a lot of activities that are going on during the course of the year. But yes, definitely want you to be thinking, there's not much could be happening at Truist with regard to conversion for the first half of '22, because frankly most of the hard work will be done by the end of this year and then we'll actually execute on the final branch closures and conversions as we head into '22. Second, a few highlights with regard to our performance on Slide 7. I'm very excited about our revenue, our total taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5.5% annualized versus the fourth quarter. That was really driven by stable net interest income, strong fee income, especially in investment banking and trading income, strong insurance performance. Chris will talk about that, if we get questions in Q&A. I am very proud of five insurance acquisitions just in the fourth quarter alone, and we expect more activities as we head into '21. A very strong adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion. We had diluted earnings per share of $1.18, diluted return on average assets of 1.35% and a very strong adjusted return on average tangible common equity of 19.03%. So as you can see, we are well on the way to top performance and all the metrics that we projected when a deal was announced, which is kind of miraculous, you know, it has been two years, there's a lot been going on, but we are still tracking and doing really well in terms of hitting that top performance level of metrics as we expected that we -- that we would. Daryl is going to be commenting on some capital issues. I would point out to you that we -- our Board did approve over $2 billion in common stock repurchases, which will start in the first quarter. We have outstanding credit quality performance, much better than expected, and our common equity Tier 1 is exactly right on 10% which is what we had projected a couple of years ago. On Slide 8, I'll just point out to you the unusual items for this quarter, and you can see that we have the regular merger charges, and as I related to earlier the incremental operating expenses are not in the long term run rate and they equated to $0.28 drive with regard to a GAAP versus adjusted. So that's a quick look at the early highlights. I mean, I'll turn it to Bill for some focus on some key areas, Bill? Just to close, we have very few comments with regard to the Truist value proposition, which is to optimize our long-term total shareholder return really through a focus on strong capital, strong liquidity and diversification and intense client focus. We believe we have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. We are the sixth largest commercial bank in the United States. We have strong market share is five fast-growing MSAs throughout the Southeast and the Mid Atlantic area. We are uniquely positioned to deliver best in class efficiency and returns while we continue to invest in the future. We're very committed as Daryl said to reaching our $1.6 billion of net cost savings. We have a really great mix of complementary businesses that allows us to expand our client base through our year old enhancement in revenue synergies. We have a very strong capital and liquidity position in sales, which positions us to be resilient as we go through very challenging times that we are experiencing. We are as I said earlier building a best-in-class new bank designed to be client purpose driven and resolutely committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. We believe our best days are here for tourists in these States of America. I'll turn it back over to Ryan. So John, a way to think about that conceptually is that, that $1.8 billion is really as I think about it like our capital allocation for future benefits in terms of client focus and better systems and better processes. So it will flow through expenses. We will continue to report it too. Also you can think about it more in terms of an investment. Well, Betsy that's a huge part of it, and I'll let Bill give you some deep color with regard to that, but this is a concept of really integrating the way we focus on the client. You know, many institutions focus on a siloed way in terms of products and different services, we don't do that. We focus on the whole needs of the client, and so we've developed this as IRM process we call it, Integrated Relationship Management, over really several decades. And it's very, very effective, very efficient because everybody owns a client. Everybody is focused on meeting all the needs of the clients all the time. But we're seeing spectacular early positive feedback in terms of how it's working especially between the community bank and CIG. Bill, you may want to comment on that. So Betsy, let me just mention in general, we have the itemized areas you've listed, but we are really focusing on expenses on a broader conceptual approach, we do in obvious. I mean, the obvious are, you know, as you got two of these, and you only need one and those kinds of things that's just going to happen. But we are heading into a period now where it's time for us to focus on optimization. It's time for us to focus on transformation or re-centralizing the business. Because so far what we basically have done is think about it as put two big banks together. Now, what we have -- and we get the -- we get less savings from that, just natural overlap. So, now we have the opportunity to re-conceptualize the business as we transform it post-COVID and all this going on with regard to the new digital world and there are enormous opportunities for us as we go through '21. So '21 is going to be an intense year of focus on expenses from the perspective of transforming our structures, so that we are doing the right things in terms of investments and expense allocations to meet the client's needs first, and we believe that will throw off positive benefits in terms of expenses. So these as I was describing are really investments, so think about this as we're building a whole new mortgage long delivery system. You will see the benefit of that in terms of -- in some cases just more efficient systems because they're newer, and the other is the effectiveness in terms of meeting client's needs. So we can -- for example in mortgage, you can do more mortgages because you're more efficient. You get more mortgage application because you have a better client experience. So it's just like, if your car has done a rundown and run out of 200,000 miles, you buy a new car, you make an investment, you see the benefit of that in terms of driving experiences, less breakdowns etc, etc. So it is an investment, that is the best way I can describe it to you to think about. Yeah, Erika, we are upbeat as well. I would say, and I'll take a second why I'm upbeat regarding the economy. This economic downturn is dramatically different than what we've all experienced in the past. If you take the money correction, it was about our commercial real estate bubble, 2000 was a technology bubble, 2008 was the residential real estate bubble. There was no bubble here. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the economy. In fact, we had ten years of robust growth, you know, have very, very low inflation, we just shut it off. That's important because we're not underlying impending issues that caused the economy to sputter. Now, if you kept it shut off for ten years, you have another issue, but given whether we ordered the vaccines, etc, we fully expect that you're most likely would see stronger snap back in the economy than most people expect. When we talked to our clients and prospects, they are really pretty upbeat. They are saying things like it's time to get on with it. We're ready to go, we're making investments and we're seeing that in terms of our robust pipeline of loan reversal activity. And so we are upbeat with regard to the economy. We think it will be slower in the first part, picking up steam as you head through the mid part, stimulus will have that summed, but mostly businesses and consumers feeling more confident. Look, when the vaccines are out there, I would say all, and as they become more widespread in terms of being injected, fear goes down, confidence goes up. People are ready to live again, people are ready to invest, are ready to run their businesses. So I fully expect by the time we head towards the fall and end of the year, you're going to be really surprised in terms of how robust this economy is. That will show up in terms of our commercial loan activity in a very big way. You're likely to see more residential loan growth than we would have expected in the slower economy and certainly you'll see in terms of our insurance activity as well. Let me just turn quick to Chris Henson and let him give you some color with regard to insurance that is very important. Erika , keep in mind what Daryl emphasized, when you're doing this project you bring all those consultants in, but you also get them out. So with regard to consultants, we have a narrow front door and a very big back door. I'm going in the back door. Yes, let me just add to Daryl's point, that's also a business mix and focus issue. So what would be traditionally a different back book look, on a forward basis as Daryl noted, I mean we're seeing improvement in margin that has to do with focus type of relationships, value that we're adding all those type things, and as he noted, you see that particularly in the commercial side. You want to call that? And just to give you a sense, we've invited 100% of round one through the path of forgiveness, but they submit information at different times. We've received and proposed on the SBA about 40% of that to this point. So some of the timing is really determined by the timing of the client provide the information. So Mike you're really right, the immediate parts, we're just trying to anchor on the $1.6 billion. We're not trying to hold out what we think is possible in terms of beating that but some of the things I talked about in terms of and we can have more branch closures than we've anticipated. We're not predicting that at this moment, but that's certainly a possibility. We certainly are going to be intensely focused on expense optimization and there are immediate opportunities for duplication across the enterprise areas that we can tend to invest in and reduce ongoing expense run rate. So the $1.6 billion related to basically putting the two companies together. The other things we do more in terms of transformation and additional opportunities we find whether non-branch office space, we see that target, maybe we get a few more branches. We certainly are very optimistic in terms of -- and expect to focus on doing that. We just want to be clear about what we've said we can do and then hold out we can probably beat that. Go ahead Daryl."

            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Kelly and good morning everybody. As Kelly just noted, Truist is the first large bank merger in the digital age. And with that in mind, we determined it was really imperative that our clients began experiencing an enhanced digital platform this year. And this is demonstrated on page 9. While our foundation is two leading digital experiences, we're going to accelerate the delivery of features like personalized financial insights, AI-driven chat bots, other client-centric enhancements. We're going to pilot this in both platforms in the second quarter and then we'll begin migration in waves in the third quarter and complete full migration to premier Truist experience for our digital clients by year end, sort of emphasizing Kelly's point of how much has been done this year. As you can see on page 10, we are experiencing excellent digital adoption and usage from our clients. So for the 12 months through November, we experienced a 26% increase in digital sales, 12% growth in active mobile users, 22% increase in mobile check deposits and a 5% increase in statement suppression. I think all would speak to increased digital adoption. This is an area where we're already seeing the benefits from our investment and on the right side, we show some recent enhancements. So for instance, the SunTrust business online and mobile experience incorporates significant updates and it was built in-house to give us more control of the app's functionality and performance long-term. The heritage award winning BB&T U platform now provides insights to help clients better manage new spending and behaviors including an end of month cash flow analysis and enhanced notifications, just to name a few, and very consistent with our whole Q3 premise. You know, this is a prime example of what Kelly talked about with best of both. Using BB&T U client driven front end at a more flexible agile heritage SunTrust driven back end, this clearly positions us I think really well for the future. We believe initiatives such as these underscore our commitment to improve the lives of our clients and demonstrate our investment effectiveness. So let's turn to page 11. We experienced further decline in balances across most loan categories in the face of continued economic uncertainty and elevated liquidity. Average total loans decreased $7.6 billion, largely attributable to commercial loan balances and ongoing run off in the residential mortgage portfolio. And commercial average balances declined $5.4 billion, primarily due to line paydowns and lower utilization. Paydowns activity reflected larger client's ability to obtain financing from capital markets and SunTrust securities is well positioned to assist them which you'll see later. Commercial balances were also impacted by $1.4 billion reduction in PPP loans and the transfer of $1 billion in assets to held for sale following our decision to exit a small ticket loan and lease portfolio. We experienced a rebound within our dealer floor plan clients after bottoming in July due to OEM supply chain disruptions, dealer floor plan balances have steadily improved as new core inventories were replenished. We also saw growth in mortgage warehouse lending and government finance. Commercial activity remains bifurcated as a whole with a greater share coming from large and medium sized companies than from small businesses. And consumer average balances decreased $2.2 billion, this was largely due to seasonality and refinance activity that resulted in lower residential mortgage, residential home equity and direct loan balances. Average balances in our indirect auto portfolio increased $1.1 billion. Loan production was really strong as vehicle sales rebounded especially for us in the prime segment. Overall, we've remained cautiously optimistic. We're hopeful that the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines together with additional government stimulus will increase visibility, revive confidence and support the economic recovery, all of which will be essential for loan growth. We are extremely well positioned in businesses and markets that we will believe will most benefit from this. So let's continue on page 12 to look at deposits. Deposit trends remain favorable during the quarter. Growth was robust and broad-based supported by a combination of seasonal inflows and ongoing growth resulting from pandemic related client behavior. Average non-interest bearing and interest checking balances were each up over $3 billion, while money market and savings were $1.1 billion. Average time deposits decreased $4.3 billion primarily due to the maturity of wholesale negotiable CDs, and higher costs personal and business accounts. Importantly, we're able to achieve a strong level of deposit growth while maximizing the value proposition to clients outside of repaying. For instance, the average total deposit costs decreased three basis points to seven basis points and average interest bearing deposit costs declined four basis points to 11 basis points. So with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to discuss our financial performance for the quarter. Hey, Betsy. I mean, this is one of the really strong cultural alignments that Kelly and I talked about, when we first started talking about this merger, is this commitment to put the client first and create a culture and a structure that evolves from that. And we're seeing it. I mean, and the model is working. As Kelly noted, a couple of examples and the Investment Banking outperformance this quarter, in particular, I mean there was really just great contribution from our Commercial Community Bank and from our CRE and from our private wealth businesses. So that model of integrated relationship management is working. It's just been great adoption, great participation, really good cultural alignment. You see it in the insurance numbers, you see it in the Wealth numbers. So it's all part of this structure and focus. And we have -- we have lots of discipline around it. But the key is the cultural side. There are people committed to wanting to work together and work together towards a common goal to meet client needs and I'd say this quarter was probably one of the better examples of how the engine is really firing on all cylinders. I might just add opportunities we're seeing really for growth, auto is very strong right now. We were up about a $1 billion in average balances. We see that continue into the first part of the year and warehouse lending because of the environment is also very, very strong."

            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill and good morning everybody. Turning to Slide 13, in the fourth quarter, reported net interest margin decreased two basis points to 3.08% reflecting lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin was unchanged at 2.72%. Core margin benefited from higher yields on PPP payoffs, recognition of deferred interest on loans and lower funding costs offset by excess liquidity. Earning assets rose $3 billion primarily due to an increase in deposits, resulting in a modest improvement in net interest income, we partially hedged our exposure to rising rates by pay-fixed swaps to offset market risk associated with our investment security. The chart on the bottom left shows the increase in our asset sensitivity due to quarter positive growth, additional pay fix loss and the residential mortgage run off, which was partially offset by the growth in the investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 14, our integrated relationship management strategy is helping to improve fee income. The noninterest income increased $179 million through third quarter security gains of $104 million. We had record investment banking and trading income of $308 million due to strong activity in M&A and loan syndications, lower counterparty refers and improved trading profits. We also generated record commercial real estate income of $123 million driven by structured real estate transactions and strong production and sales activity at Grandbridge. Insurance grew 7% versus fourth quarter of '19 due to strong production and premium growth as well as acquisitions. Organic growth was 2.9%. If you exclude the Truist policy last year, organic growth was 4.9%. We completed five insurance acquisitions during the fourth quarter, which we expect will add more than $110 million in annual revenue and approximately $7 million in adjusted expense. Turning to Slide 15, noninterest expense increased $78 million reflecting a $99 million increase in merger cost. Adjusted noninterest expense rose $27 million due to higher professional fees for strategic technology projects and higher personnel expense. Personnel expense increased $50 million reflecting higher incentives related to strong revenue production and the impact of our job re-grading process which concluded late last year. Job regrading regarding in the fourth quarter catch up in personnel expense. Approximately $50 million of this was related to prior quarters. Through the effort, we were able to honor our commitment to establish jobs and rewards program and harmonizing all teammates in the combined framework. FTEs decreased 1300 during the quarter and were down 8% since the merger was announced. We closed 104 branches during the quarter, bringing the full year total to 149, net occupancy decreased $26 million benefitting from aggressive closures of non-branch facilities. Turning to Slide 16, as we said we are seeking the opportunity to build best of both franchise. This approach is harder than a typical acquisition, but we believe the benefit to our clients justify the effort. Since the merger was announced, we have incurred $1.2 billion of merger-related and restructuring expenses. These expenses have no future benefit and are not part of the post conversion run rate. We also incurred $725 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. These expenses do provide future benefit and are integral to building a best of both franchise. The incremental operating expenses are not part of future run rate and will end after the conversions in 2022. Based on our integration plan, we expect the merger related and restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion and total incremental operating expenses of approximately $1.8 billion. This resulted in a combined total charges of approximately $4 billion. Turning to Slide 17, strong credit performance was characterized by minimal increase in NPAs and an excellent loss experience resulting in lower provision expense. We saw favorable trends in problem loan formation as the criticized and classified loans decreased 8.4%. The provision of $177 million benefited from lower charge-offs and a modest reduction in reserves. Due to the decision to exit the small ticket loan and lease portfolio, the allowed coverage ratio remained strong at 7.15 times net charge-offs and 4.39 times nonperforming loans. Active accommodations were down significantly since the second quarter. Approximately, 97% of the commercial clients and 91% of the consumer clients who exited the accommodation program are current on their loans. Our exposure to COVID sensitive industry decreased 2.6% to $27.1 billion, or approximately 9% of outstanding loans. We also had the third lowest loss rate among peers in the latest CCAR test. We believe this outcome reflects prudent client selection and underwriting as well as diversification from the merger. Turning to slide 18, the allowance for credit losses decreased $30 million largely due to moving the $1 billion portfolio into held for sale. Our macro assumptions include, unemployment remaining fairly stable through mid-2021 and improving thereafter and GDP recovery in pre-COVID levels by late 2021. We also layer in qualitative adjustments for COVID related uncertainty. Continued improvement in the economic activity, less uncertainty, and stabilization of a criticized asset may process to release reserves in the coming quarters. Turning to slide 19. Our capital ratios were relatively stable with the CET1 ratio unchanged at 10%. We declared a common dividend of $0.45 per share and a dividend and total payout ratios of 49.4%. In December, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock starting in the first quarter. Our intention is to maintain an approximate 10% CET1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions, stock repurchases and changes in risk-weighted assets. For the first quarter, we expect to repurchase approximately $500 million. The board authorized other measures to optimize our capital position, including the redemption of the outstanding Series F and G preferred stock, and liquidity remained strong and we are prepared to meet the funding needs of our clients. Turning to Slide 20, this slide highlights our progress towards achieving the $1.6 billion in net cost saves. Our efforts to reduce third-party spend are ahead of expectations. We're now targeting 10% reduction in sourceable spend of $4.5 billion. In retail banking, we closed 149 branches in 2020. On a cumulative basis, we expect to close 800 branches by the 1st of 2022 including more than 400 branches by the end of 2021. We also expect to reduce our nonbranch footprint by approximately $4.8 million square feet through the combination of closures and downsizings. Through December 31, we reduced our nonbranch footprint by approximately 2.4 million square feet. So, we're roughly halfway through our goal. The remaining facilities will be rationalized during 2021. Cost saved from technology are highly dependent on core bank conversions because we can't decommission systems or data centers until the conversions are completed. The bottom of the slide less where we are making significant investments, we believe these investments are critical to delivering on our purpose and providing our catch-plus technology equals Truist approach to clients. Turning to Slide 21, the waterfall on the left shows how we did relative to our 2020 cost savings target. Our objective for 2020 was to achieve annualized fourth quarter net cost saves of $640 million, or 40% of the $1.6 billion target. This equates to the fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expense of $3.40 billion or less. We adjusted noninterest expense of $3.174 billion and exceeded our target including catch up and expenses related to job ratings, commissions on higher revenue and the non-qualified expenses which are substantially offsetting other income. If you exclude these items, adjusted noninterest expense would come in slightly below target. As you can see from this slide, we're maintaining our medium-term targets and reaffirming our cost saving targets for 2021 and 2022. For 2021, our targeted fourth quarter adjusted expense would be $2.940 billion excluding acquisitions. Now I will provide guidance for the first quarter expressed in changes from the prior quarter. While the environment remains fluid, we continue to see momentum in our businesses, which may enable us to outperform the guidance. The first quarter had fewer number of days and seasonally higher personnel cost. We expect taxable equivalent revenue to be down 3% to 5% as a result of fewer days and purchase accounting loss. We expect our reported net interest margin to be down two to four basis points based on less purchase accounting accretion and a change in the core margin. We expect core margin to be relatively stable with the exception of increased liquidity coming from the balance sheet, that could pressure the margin up to five basis points. Non-interest expense adjusted for merger cost and amortization is expected to be down 2% to 4%. We also anticipate net charge-offs in the range of 30 to 45 basis points. Overall, we had a strong quarter with exceptional revenue growth, good margin performance and expense management and strong asset quality. Now let me turn it back to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A. Kelly, you're on mute. Yeah, John, thanks for that question. I would tell you when we were putting the transaction together in late '18 and we announced in early '19, we thought $2 billion was the merger and restructuring charges, and we're pretty much on target with that. As we continued to work on all the integrations and we saw the opportunity to really build the best in breed of what we could do with our F systems and technologies, we just knew that we would basically be having, I would call it a lot of technology projects on steroids all at once, and that this would be a really unusual time to have all that costs running through our expense structure. So that's really what we came up with. And we've been tracking it to date, so far, and we feel pretty good about the forecast that we have. We're almost at $2 billion in total when you combine both charges of both the merger and restructuring and the incremental. So we have about $2 billion to go over the next year and a half. But we believe it was for the right reasons and makes all the sense that it's going to help our clients and really produce good performance for our Company going forward. Absolutely. Yes, [Speech Overlap]. So when we came up with the five buckets, you're talking about two of the buckets, I mean the retail branches we said originally would be between 700 and 800 branches, as you can see we're at the high end of that original estimate. That will be done by the first quarter of '22. And then on corporate real estate, even before COVID, when you put these two companies together, we have huge duplication all throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. So just going through and rationalizing that space, I will tell you COVID has helped us in a number of ways in that it's emptied out the buildings, so we can move quicker in the consolidation and my guess is, as we continue to make these combinations that we may actually exceed what we had originally estimated in real corporate real estate consolidations because of COVID and just the behaviors of people working at home. Yeah, so we have a plan for where we are executing now in the $4.8 billion, once we complete that plan, I'm sure Kelly and Bill and Executive Leadership will reevaluate it and see if there is opportunity to do more in the future. Betsy, what I would say in my prepared remarks, I gave for the fourth quarter of this year the $2.940 billion, now that excludes the merger and the restructuring charges, the incremental MOE expenses, amortization. And then I gave a call out on the expenses for the Insurance acquisitions of about $70 million adjusted expenses. So all of that will get carved out of that base. But when you look at like the job re-grading marketing considering that part of the investment, that's something that we're covering with our net saves. So Matt, ideally, we would like to take this excess liquidity that we have and deploy it in loans, what we're seeing is that we just have a fair amount of payoffs in the PPP. But as businesses really come back and have a lot of momentum and start growing, as we get into the middle of latter half of '21, we really want to deploy that excess liquidity in lending. I would say that we decided to put some of that liquidity into the investment portfolio. We did that throughout the third quarter. We did partial heads up our hedges on them, basically to help with a mark-to-market on that. So when we added about $25 billion, $30 billion to the investment portfolio, we did have hedges on there about $20 million that we put on to help with the market risks that we have. So net-net, we feel good with what we've done. The real uncertainty on a go forward basis with all these new stimulus packages is, we could get potentially another $10 billion or $20 billion more liquidity into the balance sheet. I think we need to evaluate what we do with that excess liquidity whether we keep it at the Fed or invest it or ideally lend it out, which is the main primary objective. So, I'll start on the latter question first. So it's pretty simple. We basically gave you the guidance for fourth quarter of \u201821, which was a $2.940 billion, in there that excludes the restructuring, MOE, amortization and acquisitions. That said, so that's the number we're targeting to get for fourth quarter of \u201821. That's pretty simple. And then that will continue on in \u201822 when we get all the cost saves into the net $1.6 billion. Your other question on '21, what was the question again the first part? Yes, it's the technology projects. And so the expenses that we can carve out, one-time cost like when we decommission something or something is put out of use, from that perspective has no future benefit. That's in the original merger and restructuring charges. But when you have developers going in and you have people going in with systems, and you have architects building out, you know our new [indiscernible]they're basically building a whole new Truist environment and technology. All those are real costs, we're doing all these technology costs all at once. All that has future benefit, we would typically not carve that out as merger and restructuring. It's basically just the combination of doing a lot of technology projects all at once. We just thought it was fair to call out because you would never really think of doing this all at once if it wasn't for the merger. But as Kelly said, at the end of the day, we're going to have a much better client experience, we're going to have much better performance overall. And you should see the benefits of all these systems integrated by doing the best between each of the systems that I think you're having a lot of revenue and other synergies going forward. Bill, I would say in a normal balance sheet structure that would make a fair amount of sense, what we have going on our balance sheet, remember, we have some purchase accounting, we have PPP, and all that, we actually saw our yields, you can see that on our tables, you can see that we actually had loan yields higher for those various reasons. That said, I would tell you the steepening of the curve, we are asset sensitive, we're asset sensitive across the curve, little bit more short in the longer-end. But as the yield curve shifts, we will benefit from that, 25 basis point steepening of a curve will basically give us two to three basis points in core margin. So it is a phenomenon, if you look at how things are going on and off on a pure basis actually look at credit spreads going on, our commercial credit spreads are going on maybe three or four basis points higher than what they're coming off. And so I think all that is relatively good from that perspective. Yes, Chris, you want to start this one? And I'll finish off? The thing I would just add to that Bill is that it has a huge impact obviously on core margin depending on when the forgiveness happens and it could be anywhere from three to five basis points depending on the amount that actually happens in any given quarter. One thing to note, round two is really focused on more smaller loans. So those actually drive higher fees, but our average fee on round one was about 2.7. Our estimate -- this is just an estimate because it's just now starting to roll out, you might see north of 5% fees on round two. We'll have less volume, but it will also have a huge impact on those as well. Yeah, I'll be happy to do that. So when you look at margin because we have the difference between our reported margin and core margin, we are going to have less over time accretive yield going into our margin. Now that's volatile, I would say that that could be down anywhere from two to four basis points unless accretive yield that impacts reported margin on a quarterly basis. So that trends down, it's just how much is down kind of goes back and forth from that. From a core margin perspective, our core margin is actually holding up really well. We've done really well in the past couple of quarters with that. The uncertainty we have is that how much more liquidity when you get into the balance sheet and liquidity and the balance sheet pressure to core margin. If we decide to invest in equity and securities, it gives us a little bit more NII, we view it fairly basically just trend a lot of NII. So we estimate those decisions as we go forward, but depending on how much liquidity we gain with the packages, core margin, it could be a little bit volatile. I think you have to move -- shift to net interest income and focus on net interest income and what the impacts are until that in front of there. On the fee side, I would just tell you that the business has had a lot of momentum. Insurance always is very strong in the first quarter achieving the strong quarter, but if you look at those areas in investment banking and trading, huge pipelines they had build in the fourth quarter. Kelly is right with the economy. He could have a great quarter in Joe's world and whilst they have a lot of momentum, they're adding more accounts in our retail area add traction, our community bank commercial actually is growing commercial loans and you look at the detail, I don't know if Bill or Chris want to comment on the momentum we got on the revenue on those businesses. Our fee income is still strong and all that and I have to tell you it's meaningful and have to carve it out like we did this past quarter that would be actually great story to tell you. So we will continue to try to carve out when we think it makes sense to carve out that variable comp. Obviously, we're a dynamic company and things remain, but just to be sure we're doing, but everybody understands, we're not changing our commitment. We're back on our way from the $1.6 billion that we made in February '19. We're going to get those cost savings, So I won't tell you we are investing more than what we originally sight, but we think these are the right investments that we're making in our people, technology, digital are all for the right reasons. So we are making more investments than what we originally thought. We haven't communicated that number publicly, but just now that we are going to get our net savings maybe more clear at some point but let us get the $1.6 first and right now we are making a lot of investments in the company as we're moving forward and you're seeing it in the results. Look at our revenues, look at our account growth that we're getting and we're doing really, really well in the midst of a lot of conversion, which would really distract a lot of businesses. We are performing at a very high level."

            "name": "Chris Henson",
            "content": "Thanks Kelly and Erika thank you for the question. So maybe just to sort of fourth quarter and maybe just the outlook to your point, one of the best quarters that we have had in some time and with all the drivers of organic growth are really kind of hitting, hitting on all cylinders, client retention has stabilized in and retail at north of 90% for the last eight months wholesale, really strong at 85%, we're really seeing the cause of the factors in the market. Standard carriers are pushing risk to the wholesale market, and we're benefiting from that. Pricing another element organic growth as strong as we're in the hardest market we've seen in two decades, rates are up in the industry, north of 7%. And it's anticipated that we'll continue to see some hardening and acceleration into \u201821. Our new business, new business in 2019 was up in the 12% to 13%. That was as good as we've seen and we hit COVID. We were kind of negative 4% to 6%, didn't know where the year was going to shake out. But this quarter, our new business was up 19.5% up 8% year-to-date, some of the best numbers I have ever seen. So that all led to an organic growth number that we reported 2.9% to like quarter, 4.3% year-to-date. But just to key in on one point Daryl made, I think it's really important. The 2.9% growth number was really negatively impacted by one-time MOE related piece of insurance that was booked for our MOE deal in Q4 \u201819. So if you exclude that noise, organic growth really would have been on a core basis 4.9%. In terms of output, we expect first quarter commissions to be up in the 10% range, we're moving from our third best quarter of the year to our second best and first, obviously uncertainties in COVID that impact the economy. But the outlet is really strong given accelerator pricing, exposure units in the business are holding. We're growing excess and surplus lines because of the shift that I mentioned in the standard cares of support retail pushing it to E&S. And we're really benefiting from that diversification. And the pricing momentum, you think about the markets digest and the COVID impacts, CAT losses. We had 30 storms this year, the most in history in any given year. And three of the largest years in history of CAT losses occurred in the last four years. So it's got upward pressure and then lower interest rates, which puts pressure on investment income for underwriters. So pricing up 7%, you're seeing examples of things like in excess of 12.5%, D&O up 11.5%, property was we had a lot of up 9%, up in all classes all accounts. So, looking forward, what we're expecting is, in first quarter, is somewhere around the 5% kind of organic growth rate number. And we think that elevated catastrophe level, low interest rates , all that's really going to keep it propped up. And Kelly mentioned acquisitions, we were able to close five in the fourth quarter, and we expect more in 2021, so really bullish about insurance going forward. Sure. Yes, we do obviously plan to participate in Round 2, probably in the neighborhood of $3 billion or so. We see most in Round 1 playing out through '21 and Round 2 probably coming in, the first half of the year and then rolling out the back half of the year. Really hard to call exactly when what quarter exactly that all is going to flow out. But to answer your question that I would say 90 plus percent of it should be gone by the end of \u201821. If we look at things like pipelines going forward and production in the fourth quarter, we have a reason to be optimistic that's against a headwind though of PPP paydowns and utilizations being at uniquely low level. So I think the things that we can control production pipelines are doing well and then I think we'll see the benefit of that over time whether that manifest itself in first quarter, second, third or fourth will be dependent upon all the things that will build confidence and market acceptance of where we are. Thanks for the question, this is Chris. You're right, we did finish around 5% and based on what I see now, I think around 5% would be certainly a good number for call it the first half of next year. We call it the last half when we give the quarter in or so. So we feel very, very good about it but I must tell you if pricing holds and I believe that it will and if the economy does begin to turn via vaccinations getting pushed out to the country and we're able to see then better new business growth as a result, some example of what we saw in the fourth quarter, could it be better, I think it's possible that it could. So I think the opportunity really kind all the cylinders have opportunity to move. I do think that growth is going to be dependent upon what happens with COVID and the economy and kind of get all that going, but certainly we do get vaccinated out stimulus first half of the year, I think it bodes well for organic growth in that business for sure and your question about is the margin better than one than the other, strategically as a bank, the reason we want exposure to both, if we want to bank, it probably wouldn't matter as much, but what we're really interested in is for this business to provide good downside protection when credit markets are challenging and you can see it this year this past year, 4.3% organic growth for the year I think is pretty solid given the backdrop. And the reason we do that is because the wholesale and retail is going to operate in difference to each other. So you're going to depending on whether you're in hard in soft market, one it is going to help balance the other that we're interested in the combination of the growth there. So certainly a little bit better contribution from wholesale today than retail, but they're making nice contribution."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ryan Richards, Director of Investor Relations for Truist Financial Corporation.\nRyan Richards: Thank you, Vijay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today.

Good morning, everybody. I really appreciate you all joining our call. And I hope you and your family are doing well. Now, I would say, relative to the challenges that we're all facing, we're really happy to report what I call a great quarter, strong balance sheet, particularly an asset quality, liquidity and capital, relatively strong earnings, great value proposition for our clients, particularly in our digital offerings, great team, which I am extraordinarily proud of and a strong commitment to our communities and other stakeholders. We are, as you know, from our previous conversations, really focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. And I want to show on slide 5, a few of the things we're doing to live out our purpose. So, we announced recently something we're very excited about a $40 million donation to help establish an organization called CornerSquare Community Capital. This is a new organization that will be focusing on funding to racially and ethnically diverse small business owners, women and individuals, and LMI communities. This will be done through CDFIs, community development financial institutions, and it's a very exciting opportunity to get funds exactly where they're needed. We're real proud of our first Truist CSR report. I hope you've had a chance to read it. We launched recently, our Truist Momentum, which is continuation of a SunTrust program that focuses on financial wellbeing. We partnered with EverFi to introduce -- this is something we're very excited about a game called WORD Force, which helps kids in K-2, learn how to read. You've heard me say in the past, unfortunately, in our country today, two thirds of the kids in the public school system in the third grade cannot read. This is a way of getting at that. It may not be the all-in answer, but it's a really good start. We're excited about it. We're in our beta test, but we already have over 4,000 students and over 200 schools participating. We are doing a really good job in terms of conservation of energy, water and making good progress on a number of areas like that, investing in those areas to make our climate and our environment better. We did, as you know, announce as part of the merger, our $60 billion Community Benefits Plan over the next three years. We're very excited about that. As you can see on the slide, a number of areas that we're really committed to. I would particularly point out that we will be investing in loans and/or investments $32 billion over the next three years in home purchase mortgage loans and to LMI and minority borrowers. So, this is a big part of helping to deal with some of the social injustice and racial inequity problems that we have in our country, and a number of other programs that you can see there. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to improving our diversity. We said in our CSR report that we have committed, over the next three years to improve our senior leadership diversity from 12% in 2019 to 15%. You can see there that we have a very good and effective diverse Board with 45% being women and minorities. So, we feel really good about that. I'd also point out we were honored to receive a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2020 Corporate Equality Index. So, we're doing a really good job with regard to living our purpose. If you look at slide 6, I\u2019d just point out a few highlights, we did have taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion. Net income available to common shareholders of $1 billion, but adjusted net income available to common was $1.3 billion. That resulted in diluting earnings per share on adjusted of $0.97. Return on average tangible common equity adjusted was 16.0%, very strong, and a really good efficiency ratio adjusted at 57.3%. We were really pleased about our nonperforming assets at 0.26%. And we recognize that there's more to come with regard to credit quality deterioration, depending on what happens with regard to the economy. But still, given where we are today and recognizing there are some positive impacts with regard to accommodations there, that's a really good number. We feel really good about that. And likewise, our net charge-offs were 0.42%, at the low end of what we had talked about. We're very pleased that our common equity Tier 1 is now at 10%. So, we feel really good about our capital position. If you look at some selective items on slide 7, I\u2019d just point out we did have security gains of $104 million, which was a positive $0.06 per share. We had merger and restructuring charges of $236 million, which is $0.13. We did have incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Remember, these are expenses that don't qualify for MRRC [ph] in terms of calling out because they do have future benefits, but they're not a part of our longer term run rate. That was $152 million, and that was $0.08. And we did make a $50 million unusual contribution to our charitable foundation, and that was $0.03. So, if you put all that together, it was a negative impact to EPS of about $0.18. So, we feel good about the adjusted number because of the quality of these selected items. On slide eight, just a couple of comments with regard to loans. As you all know, loans are a real challenge for us and for the industry now because of what's going on in the economy. Of course, we did see a big run-up in loans in the second quarter. And likewise, we saw a big rundown in loans into third, as a large number of the corporate line draw-downs were repaid. So, we saw total loan reductions of $11 billion. $9.5 billion of that was in the C&I area. So, that's principally what happened. We did have some bright spots. We had growth in LightStream, our national consumer digital platform. Sheffield had a growth, recreational lending, prime auto. We did have some decreases in some other consumer areas, like resi mortgage and so forth. So, it's kind of a mixed bag with regard to consumer. But overall, the big story in loans is, if you exclude the run-up in balances in the second and the run-down in the third was relative flat. I would say to you that we do expect future headwinds. With regard to the PPP loans, we have about $12.5 billion there. That will begin to pay off as we head into the fourth and the first and probably the second. Loan growth is really challenging now, obviously. But, banks are a reflection of the economy. And so, we should not be surprised about that. The real question is what's going to happen to the economy. I would just point out, and this is just one person's opinion. It's important to look back at previous corrections that we've had. And there's virtually all ways of material precipitating event. So, in 1991, we had the commercial real estate bubble; 2001, we had the technology bubble; 2008, we had the residential real estate bubble; this one didn't have a bubble. This was a very strong 10-year economy, 3.5% unemployment rate. We just shut it down, appropriately so for medical reasons, but we shut it down. I'll make that point to say that if this pandemic doesn't go on too much longer, there's a chance that we can get a snap back in the economy that most people would not expect, because it wasn't structurally in trouble to start with. Now, if it stays on a long time, then all bets are off. I personally believe, as we head into the first quarter, we'll begin to see some real developments with regard to bank names. We certainly have already had substantial developments, positive developments with regard to medical -- mitigation of ramification. So, we are somewhat optimistic, although cautious, as we think about the economy going forward. I will tell you, as I get feedback from our client-facing people, while they're not facing them in person as much today, we're talking to people more probably than we ever did now, although virtually. David Weaver, who runs our Commercial Community Bank, told me the other day, he had nine calls in one day. So, we've been very, very efficient. But to his point, clients are being very resilient. I'm speaking particularly of middle and upper market. One of the quotes that I got recently was clients to say, it's time to move on. And to be honest, that's kind of what we said. We set back for a while and didn't make virtual calls and said we were waiting for the pandemic. And then several months ago, we just kind of said, we got to get on with running our business because our clients need us. So, our clients are being today is there saying kind of my business is okay. Now, the small -- very small micro end is struggling. And depending on how long this lasts, we will see a substantial shakeout in the small business, micro market. At the aggregate economic level, that will reshuffle and reallocate itself. But at a personal level for those small business people, that's a very sad story. So, we've got to hope that this moves along as rapidly as possible. I'll say finally that our pipelines are improving. Our calling activity is robust. And we feel very good about where we're going relative to what happens to the economy. On slide 9, just a brief comment about deposits, which are doing great. We continue to have a nice inflow, somewhat because of the flight to quality. We had $1.4 billion increase in deposits on a linked-quarter basis. We had a $10 billion increase following other previous quarter increases in noninterest-bearing deposits. So, we feel really good about that. Our noninterest-bearing deposits today are 33.3% of total deposits versus 27.8% in the first quarter. So, you can see how rapidly our DDA or noninterest-bearing deposits have increased. We've been focusing a lot of attention with regard to getting our cost down, with regard to our deposit structure. And we've made really good progress. Our total deposit costs decreased from 12 basis points to 10 basis points. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 17 basis points, down to 15 basis points. So, really good progress in managing our cost of deposits. I would point out, if you\u2019re following the math and all of our deposit activity there, we did divest $2.2 billion in deposits this quarter. And so, that's a material factor. So overall, I would say our deposits are doing great. With that, let me turn it to Daryl for some more detail.\nDaryl Bible: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to cover highlights from the third quarter and provide our fourth quarter outlook. Turning to slide 10. Reported net interest margin decreased 3 basis points, primarily due to lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin increased 5 basis points, the first increase since the first quarter of 2019. Core margin benefited from strong DDA growth, lower funding costs, lower COVID-related deferred interest. Lower yields on loans and securities remain a headwind. During the quarter, we used excess reserves to purchase $5 billion of high-quality securities, improving our yield on those assets by approximately 100 basis points. Our asset sensitivity increased in the third quarter, and we plan to stay slightly asset sensitive. We will continue to protect our margin by placing rate floors on commercial loans and manage deposit costs. Due to our excess funding position, we are being strategic about deposit costs by focusing on growing noninterest-bearing deposits. Given the low rate environment, we are placing pay fixed swaps to partially hedge our investment securities and associated changes in OCI. We expect the reported net interest margin to slightly decrease for the remainder of the year. Turning to slide 11. Adjusted noninterest income was relatively flat versus a robust second quarter. Fee income categories impacted by the pandemic continued to improve. Our activity on deposits is normalizing, coupled with lower fee waivers. Card and payment-related fees increased as payment volumes improved. Wealth management income increased as a result of higher market valuations. Despite the seasonally weak quarter, insurance income grew 6.4% on a like-quarter basis due to firmer pricing and an uptick in new business. Residential mortgage income decreased, primarily due to a $72 million change in the net MSR valuation, driven by higher prepayments. Investment banking had a record quarter, but trading was off from a great second quarter, resulting in lower revenue. Other income increased due to the increase in the value of nonqualified plan assets and other investments. Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expense decreased $123 million as losses on debt extinguishment and higher intangible amortization during the second quarter were partially offset by higher merger-related costs and a charitable contribution. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $20 million, primarily due to an increased personnel expense, marketing costs and professional services. The increase in personnel expense reflects higher nonqualified plan costs that were offset by other income, higher medical costs due to normalization, pension cost adjustment and a reduced labor cost capitalization due to lower loan volume. Truist remains highly disciplined on core expenses. Average FTEs decreased 769 during the quarter, and we expect further reductions this year. We plan to close 104 branches in December and January and are looking at ways to bring forward more branch closures in 2021. Turning to slide 13. Asset quality ratios remained relatively stable. The NPA ratio increased 1 basis point to 26 basis points, and the NPL ratio increased 2 basis points to 37 basis points, primarily due to C&I loans. Annualized net charge-offs relative to average loans and leases increased 3 basis points to 42 basis points. We took a $97 million PCD adjustment to net charge-offs. Excluding that, net charge-offs would have been 29 basis points. The provision of $421 million exceeded net charge-offs of $326 million, increasing an allowance by $95 million. The allowance was 1.91% of loans and leases, up from 1.81%. Coverage ratios remained strong at 4.52 times net charge-offs and 2 -- 5.22 times nonperforming loans. The combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value work remains very robust at 2.76% of total loans. Turning to slide 14. Our exposure to sensitive industries continues to decline to a low of 9.1% of loans held for investment. Outstanding balances to sensitive industries decreased $2.2 billion to $27.9 billion. We continue to closely monitor and manage our sensitive industry portfolios. Turning to slide 15. The volume of loans with the accommodations have decreased significantly since June 30th. Approximately $692 million of commercial loans had an active activation at the end of September 30, down from $21.2 billion. In consumer, $6.2 billion had active accommodation, down from $11.3 billion. The declines reflect expiration of the initial payment relief, which was not renewed by the borrower. Since June 30th, approximately 98% of the commercial borrowers and 94.5% of the consumer borrowers who exited payment relief, either paid off their balance or are in current status. Turning to slide 16. The allowance for credit losses increased $96 million to reflect loan re-grading uncertainty related to the expiration of government stimulus programs. Our economic assumptions include extended GDP recovery, high-single-digit unemployment through mid-2021, followed by continued improvement through the remaining reasonable and supportable forecast period. Our ACL estimates also reflect qualitative adjustments for model limitations, government stimulus, accommodation and the review of SNC. Turning to slide 17. Capital ratios improved for the second straight quarter and are strong relative to regulatory requirements. Our reported CET1 ratio increased to 10% from 9.7% last quarter. We also issued $925 million of preferred stock to strengthen our Tier 1 and total capital ratios. The recent assigned stress capital buffer of 270 basis points remained in effect until September when a revised stress capital buffer will be provided. We plan to submit our capital plan in early November as required by the Federal Reserve. Our purpose of capital priorities continues to be organic growth and our dividend. We remain open to bolt-on acquisitions with fee income businesses. Turning to slide 18. Liquidity remains strong with an LCR ratio of 117% and liquid asset buffer of 18.6%. Our access to secured funding sources is robust with over $200 billion of cash, securities and secured borrowings. Parent company is sufficient to cover 22 months of contractual and expected outflows with no inflows. Turning to slide 19. We continue to see strong growth in digital banking. Truist opened up 56,000 net new accounts versus 15,000 last quarter, driven by digital and increased branch traffic. For the 12 months through August, we experienced a 21% increase in digital sales, 8% increase in active mobile users, 23% increase in mobile check deposits and a 5% increase in statement suppression. We are also proud of the recognition we received recently from Javelin. Heritage BB&T was recognized as a leader in ease-of-use and financial fitness in mobile banking and a leader in financial fitness in online banking. Heritage SunTrust was recognized as a leader in ease-of-use and online banking. These awards demonstrate the strength of our heritage platforms and the opportunities as Truist advances digital capabilities. Turning to slide 20. As we have said, our primary reason for the merger is to exceed client expectations through seamless integration of touch and technology to create trust. To get there, we are harvesting cost saves from combined companies to fund increased investment and ultimately drive best-in-class performance. We are fully committed to achieving $1.6 billion in net cost saves and continue to make good progress on personnel expense, corporate real estate, branch rationalization, third-party spend and system decommissioning and data center closures. At the same time, we are also investing in digital, marketing and technology. We are also investing in talent, including areas outside of digital and our revenue businesses. Together, these investments and cost saves will allow us to generate best-in-class returns versus our peers while providing distinctive, secure and successful client experiences through touch and technology. Now, I will provide our fourth quarter guidance, which is based on linked-quarter changes versus the third quarter where our guidance provides a path to positive operating leverage. We expect taxable equivalent revenue, excluding onetime security gains to be down 1% to 3%, driven by lower purchase accounting accretion. We expect reported net interest margin to be down 3 to 5 basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion and core margin to be relatively flat. Core noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization is expected to be down 2% to 4%, reflecting lower personnel expense. We also anticipate net charge-offs to between 40 and 60 basis points. Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for a merger update, closing remarks, and Q&A.\nKelly King: Thanks, Daryl. If you follow along on slide '21, I would say to you, generally, the merger is on track. Integration and conversion, we feel really good about where we are. We're making really great progress. Most importantly, our culture is really strong. And I would say to you kind of interestingly that the COVID experience has actually bonded our team together even faster than we would have expected, because when you go through a really, really tough time and you\u2019re kind of thrown in the boat together, it encourages our strength in terms of development relationships, trust and bonding. So, we could not feel better about how strong our culture is and how well it is developing. Some very notable activities in terms of the integration and conversion, we did complete the branch divestiture, as I mentioned. We recently announced something we're very excited about, what we call Truist Ventures. This is where we are making relatively small, but important investments in technology platforms that we can build into our value proposition. We are testing now for our client conversion at wealth and mortgage, which will come up in the spring. So, there will be a number of conversions that have occurred or will occur on the way towards the core conversion. We did launch our dual service branch pilots. This is a technical theme, but it's very important as we move down the road, as Daryl alluded to, in terms of accelerating our branch closings as we head into next year. Very importantly, we did complete our end-to-end Truist Securities conversion. This is a big deal. As we know, this is the first virtual conversion that has occurred, and it was seamless. Our people did a fantastic job. And it's a big deal because we are really big securities operation now, backing up our corporate and investment banking business. Core conversion is on track for the first half of '22. So, we feel good about where everything is with regard to integration and conversion. If you look at slide 22, just a word about our value proposition as we wrap up. We are, as I said in the beginning, driven by our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. Our goal long term is to grow earnings with less volatility relative to our peers over the long term. That's kind of the commitment we made to our shareholders. We base that on a very exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. As we said, we are the sixth largest commercial bank in the U.S. today that gives us scale to be able to compete. We're very strong in our marketplace, and that gives us the efficiency that we need. We are the sixth largest insurance broker. We have really strong growth there. I think, we're going to report a 5.3% organic growth, which we believe will probably top in the market. We're the number one regional bank on investment firm; we\u2019re the number two regional bank originator -- mortgage originator and servicer. So, very, very strong franchise. We're really positioned well to be best-in-class in terms of efficiency and returns. At the same time, we'll be investing heavily in the future. As Daryl said, we are confident in achieving our $1.6 billion of net cost savings. At the same time, we'll be investing in our revenue synergy operation. I would tell you that our IRM, our integrated relationship management strategy, is going great. As you know, in the beginning, we've said there were huge opportunities to leverage the strength that SunTrust had and the strength BB&T had. And I would say that is ahead of schedule. The receptivity of our people with regard to cross-selling, if you will, these products and services across the organization is robust. And frankly, there's just a lot of enthusiasm about it. We are making key investments in technology, in our teammates, in marketing and in advertising, all of which will drive our above-average organic growth and long term, stable and growing profitability. At the same time, we have a very strong capital base, as you can see, very strong liquidity and a very resilient risk profile. We're very prudent, disciplined in risk in financial management. We have a very conservative risk culture. We have heard diversified benefits arising from the merger that was just kind of naturally implicit in the merger. We've stressed that very well, as you've seen, with very strong capital, very strong liquidity. And we have a very strong and defensive balance sheet, which is insulated by purchase accounting marks, combined with the CECL credit reserve. So, overall, I would say we have a great culture. We have a great franchise. We have a great team. And we fully believe -- I fully believe our best days are ahead. Ryan?\nRyan Richards: Thank you, Kelly. Vijay, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session?\nOperator: Sure. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. Daryl, I wanted to ask you a question on the expense side. Clear that your timing on the cost saves is on track from a long-term perspective. Two pieces. Number one, at what point do we see the incremental operating expenses start to settle back down? They've been on a steady increase since September of last year. And then, two, can you give us any update in terms of your expected realization of those cost saves as we kind of reset the bar in a COVID world and understand, like just your timing recognition of those cost saves? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So, Ken, what I would tell you is, is that we are still on the uptick in our merger and MOE-related expenses. We are just going through the developing phases of that. Testing starts in the first quarter as we start with kit testing and then we go onto UAT testing as we get ready for client day one in early part of 2022. So, I would say, we're still on the uptick there. To-date, since we announced the transaction in February '19, we have about $1.5 billion of combined MRRC and MOE-related expenses. And at that time, we said we would be at $2 billion. I don't have a number of what it is going yet. We will probably give that to you in January. We will probably exceed that number sometime in the first quarter, the $2 billion number. I want to give you a number and make sure we hit the number that I gave you in our earnings call in January from that standpoint. So, we're coming through figuring all that out, and we'll get back to you on that. But, I would say, we'll still stay elevated for the next several quarters as we -- and we have thousands and thousands of people right now working on hundreds of systems, getting them ready, getting them tested. And we just got to make sure this is flawless. And we have to be -- have a great client experience, we have to make sure everything goes right. It costs a little bit of money. You have to remember, Ken, on this, we chose to choose the better of the two when we had our choices. We didn't take the easy way out and just convert everything all one way or the other. So, for a commercial platform, we chose to use the heritage BB&T servicing system, AFS, coupled with the heritage SunTrust and CNO piece. That takes a lot more time, a lot more complexity. But, when we get it done, we will be so far better. We're doing it in the retail banking platform as well where we have the BB&T heritage deposit system, coupled with heritage SunTrust automated teller. Again, more complexity. But when we get through all this in '22, we will be light years ahead of most of our peers because of what we're doing from that. So, it's the right thing to do. It costs a lot of money to do it. We're going to do it right and we're going to execute.\nKen Usdin: Got it. And one long-term question. I know that with the low-20s ROTCE, the outlook that you had previously was pre-COVID. A lot of changes out there. Consensus for '22 is obviously nowhere near it. Can you help us understand, like what you think is doable longer term? Obviously, the provision is a big input into that, or at what point do you think we can get some updated expectations on what's doable for this franchise?\nKelly King: So, Ken, we still feel confident over the long term and the original expectation of low 20s ROTCE. Remember, we're already very, very strong in the environment that we're in today. And as Daryl described, we're really just getting started in terms of getting the long-term investment -- investments made and related expense reductions that will follow. And then, of course, you've got all the revenue synergies that I alluded to. So, we are very, very good about that. Obviously, we'll ebb and flow some based on the economy. But, that's still a reasonable number for Q4.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Michael Rose from Raymond James.\nMichael Rose: I just wanted to get -- Daryl, I just wanted to get some color on this quarter's PCD review. And then, if you can give us some credit metrics around the kind of the select at-risk exposures. I obviously, saw the balances drop. But, if you can give us any sort of sense on what the migration looked like this quarter in some of those at-risk exposures? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So, Michael, I'll take the PCD question, then I'll pick to Clarke, and he can maybe answer the accommodation piece of it. So on the PCD, remember, when we closed in December, we closed under the -- now what I would say, old accounting method where we had to set up PCI. When CECL came in into January, we went from PCI to PCD. In that process, we went through -- we grossed up loans and carrying values in connection with the establishment of PCD of our best estimates. As we -- as the year played out, what we realized is we grossed up the loans, and we should have not gross them up to the full value. They should have been today charged off from that perspective. So, it was an adjustment that we made this quarter. We think we've gone through the book, and we've caught everything there. So, in essence, we would have just had a different number in the first quarter when we got our CECL numbers. But, it was an adjustment that we made. It's a noncash item. And we had really good charge-off. If you exclude that $29 million we had good charge-off, even if you add that in, it\u2019s $42 million. Both beat guidance.\nClarke Starnes: Clarke? Thanks, Daryl. Hey, Michael. As far as the sensitive entry, you see on the slide there we've got in the deck, we had a nice couple of billion dollar reduction this quarter. It's been a very-targeted effort to work with those borrowers and reduce the exposure. So, I would say the highlights of the quarter there is we worked very aggressively to get a handle on, particularly in the energy portfolio and hospitality side. We actually sold $300 million worth of hotel credits at pretty good pricing and also address good bit of the energy book. So to give you some context, nonperformers in that portfolio of sensitive industries are still less than 100 basis points. And we have less than 2% of those balances there in any kind of accommodation or deferral. So, I consider really strong progress, and we'll continue to watch that closely, and it's all considered in our reserves as well.\nMichael Rose: Okay. I appreciate that. And maybe just as my follow-up, you guys had 10% CET1. Obviously, buybacks on hold for you and others this quarter. How should we think about capital deployment? Any updated thoughts that you guys have would be appreciated.\nKelly King: So, Mike, we're really happy to be at 10%. And as you know, we have said that, that was our target. So, that's a very comfortable position. As we think about it going forward, it's really a function of, of course, when we're actually able to do buybacks and dividend increases. But, the way we think about it is about risk projection. And so, if we look forward and we feel like the economy has stabilized and growing, if we look forward in terms of the pandemic, it's under control, and we can feel comfortable in terms of a projected relatively stable, less volatile, growing revenue streams, then we'll feel comfortable in terms of turning back on buybacks and considering dividend increases. I'd say, today, it's just premature. We just don't know what we don't know. And to go out there today and try to make those kind of assumptions, I think, is shooting in the dark. I do think as we head into next year, we'll see clarity with regard to the pandemic. We'll see clarity with regard to the economy. As I said earlier, I think the chance is that economy will still be better than the most things. So, there's a decent chance we'll have that decision to make as we head into the, let's call it, first half of next year. But today, it's just a tad premature.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Daryl, can you share with us -- you mentioned that you guys purchased $5 billion of securities using your excess reserves, and you helped the NIM by about a basis point. What's left? I mean, how much more of the excess reserves can you put to work? And, can you also share with us what was the duration of those purchases to be able to get that higher interest margin even though it was only 1 basis point?\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So, Gerard, so our current duration of our portfolio because of prepayment speeds picked up were just a tad over 3 years right now, 3.1. But, they do have negative convexities. So, it is -- can move in and out from that perspective. What I would say is, that we are in the midst of moving some more of our liquidity that we have -- in fact, we have a little over $30 billion at the Fed. Currently, we are moving that over, some of it this quarter, maybe more of it into early next year. We are layering in some hedges. Now, I would tell you, the hedges that we're putting on are pay fixed hedges. We're buying mortgage back, which as you know, has cash flows that paid out over the life of those assets. The way FASB has approved a hedge accounting on this, it's only allowed to use bullet swaps. They do have a task force that they are working on, trying to look for other ways to allow for this -- it's called last layer of hedging, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to put on a little stronger hedges. But the hedges we're putting on will mute some of the OCI volatility. If they get come through and allow us to use maybe amortizing swaps instead of just bullet swaps, that would significantly improve the performance of those hedges. So, we're hopeful about that. But, we are trying to hedge it the best that we can. Right now the costs of these pay fixed swaps are really low at 12 basis points. So it doesn't really impact it. So, we are in the midst of moving over. I always look at it as an opportunity cost right now. We could have lower rates for the next three years. That's what's in the forecast, five years, you just don't know. And I think it's good to be deployed. The way I would think of it, though is that if rates were to go up or we started to lose some of the search deposits, our cash flows from this investment portfolio we're building could be easily $10 billion a quarter. So, we could just not reinvest. If we have strong loan growth, we could use that cash flow to deploy into loan growth. So, it gives us a lot more flexibility, a lot more optionality. And it also helps protect our margin and help run rate. You pay us to run our company and do what we think is best. We think this is a good balanced approach to managing the company.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And as a follow-up, Kelly, I share your view about vaccines in this COVID and the therapeutics that we'll have next year. And hopefully, the economy really starts to open up. But I want to come back to something you said about the small business owners and if the economy doesn't come back, there could be some more meaningful fallout. Can you kind of frame for us, and I know it's subjective, but can you frame for us when does -- if the economy doesn't come back by the second quarter or the first quarter, when do you really start to get concerned about that fallout?\nKelly King: Well, Gerard, that's something else, we don't know. But I think today that some of course have already gone away. I mean, they couldn't -- for whatever reason, they couldn't qualify by the stimulus. They chose not to. They just threw in the towel. But that's a small percentage. Most have been buoyed by the stimulus support, PPP and other loan assistance programs. As that begins to phase out, these businesses will have tougher decisions to make. But, I'll tell you that a lot of these small businesses are pretty creative. I mean, they're pretty resilient. And so, I wouldn't expect to see a majority of small businesses fold or anywhere close to that. I think, most are going to find ways to reinvent their business. It's incredible how smart all business people are. That -- basically, my whole career, and they're pretty tough group. So, I wouldn't write them off. I'm just saying that it has gone into the second quarter and [indiscernible] someone back out buying again, and we will see a shakeout. Here's the thing today, consumer purchases are back up. The credit card activity, I mean, it's up year-over-year. So, it went through a trough. It's back up year-over-year. So, they're buying, but buying in different ways. So, what these small businesses have to do is figure out whether it's carryout or dine out in the backyard or whatever it is if you're a restaurant. The creative ones will figure it out. Some won't be able to figure it out, and they'll have to find another career. But, I think that all will begin to be clear, Gerard, as we head into the second quarter.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Hi. Just on credit, so a couple -- two-part question there. First, on the delinquencies, it looks like both, 90-plus and 30 to 89 increase. I just want to get some color what you're seeing beginning to migrate? If there's any concentration there, what's driving that? And then, separately, on the loan loss reserves, if we do see the delinquencies start to interpret into a steady rise in charge-offs, is it fair to assume as charge-offs rise that you're adequately reserved? And accordingly, you could see the reserve to loan ratio decline as that happens?\nClarke Starnes: John, this is -- yes, this is Clarke. I'll answer that, John. On the delinquency side, we typically see, in consumer anyway, some elevated early stage as you go through the second half of the year. So, third quarter is going up a little bit, part of that seasonal. You'll see a lot of it's concentrated in the government-guaranteed portfolios around student and mortgage. So, if you take that out, particularly for your 90-plus, that was the majority there. It was flat otherwise. So, again, nothing alarming at this point. We anticipate part of that each year. And to your second question, all of that is considered as we go through our modeling and our allowance and our view of the scenarios that we selected. So, yes, I think we've assumed there will be further deterioration as we move forward. This is very likely. And that's all been included in our estimate to date.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then, secondly, on the net interest margin front. I know that you indicated that -- Daryl, that the reported margin should see some slight pressure through the remainder of the year. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the core margin outlook, just given some of the actions you've taken, and how you're thinking about that from here?\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So, I would tell you, we had a good drop in deposit cost this past quarter. We still think we have room to go there. So, our interest-bearing costs are 15%. My guess is over the next quarter or two, will be single digit. I think, that's just the direction that we're headed right now. I think that's a possibility. I think that will help. I think, as we can grow some of our consumer portfolio successfully, that will help mitigate some of our core margin. You have higher yields in those portfolios, and that would definitely help as we were able to be successful in growing that. And the other thing I would just tell you is that we are doing everything we can to protect our core margin and try to grow as much as we can to offset the runoff. The runoff of purchase accounting is a little bit -- it's hard to predict. It depends on how the loans pay down on that. My guess right now is that it be down 3% to 5% right now, but you really don't know what's going to come through from that. You just have to do the best that you can with what's running off from that. But with PPP coming out over the next couple of quarters, that will help keep core margin probably in the 270s, and that will help mitigate the reduction of GAAP to what, depending how much you get PPP pay downs. Our guess is the bulk of our pay-downs will come in the first quarter or maybe second quarter. We'll get some this quarter. Recall, our company has about $12.5 billion of PPP loans on the books. We are planning to have invitations sent to all of our clients in the month of November, so they will all get invitations. How quickly they can respond with the documentation and we submit it to SBA is just a huge process. That's why we're thinking it's more centered in the first half of '21 than in this quarter, but you don't really know. It's an unknown right now.\nKelly King: Well, a couple of other things. Keep in mind that our people have been very successful in terms of floors with regard to new loans and existing renewals. The other thing is that if the economy comes back faster, which I think it may, there's going to be a substantial pent-up demand for expansions. And so, we will see an increase in loan demand for, I call it, normally priced loans, which will be a plus to grow the NIM. So a couple of things there could really help us on NIM in addition to what Daryl said.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. I know you said relatively flat on the core NIM in your guidance. I was just looking for the drivers behind it and then maybe the behavior beyond that. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning. Okay. A couple of questions. One is on how you think about the reserve release. I know it's early to ask this question, but we all model out a couple of years. So, I'm just trying to understand what your thought process is with regard to when you would start to release reserves? Is it to match any net charge-offs that you get from here, or maybe there's something else you're thinking about you could let us in on? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Clarke, do you want to take that or...\nClarke Starnes: Yes. Maybe I'll start and then Daryl or Kelly can kick in. I mean certainly, Betsy, we think it's premature to be talking about releases right now, given the environment. So, I think you'll see in our estimate this quarter we've been, I think, prudent around considering there's still a lot of economic uncertainty around whether there'll be any more stimulus, what the ultimate outcome of these accommodations are and just pace of the recovery. So, I think for us, we would want to be sure we have much better clarity there and see the economy on very firm ground and client performance be at a really strong level before I think you see us consider releases.\nBetsy Graseck: And, I guess the question -- yes, go ahead. \nKelly King: One of the things, kind of interesting -- so to your point, if everything were precise, as I understand it, the economy performs as we expected in terms of our CECL projections, rates are as we projected, so our net present value is the same as projected, if all of that would happen, it would be a hands down correlation between reserve reductions productions and [indiscernible] But as Clarke said, it's not going to be 100% correlation. And the other thing is, and I hope this is not true, but do we get any pressure from the regulators to hold theirs up even though all the math and all the concepts say should be coming down? We've not heard think about that, but that's how the way it goes.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. So, how does it work with CECL, as my follow-up question? I know maybe that's a little bit longer than the time you want to spend on it -- on this topic. But the question really is around how to think about the trajectory of the reserves from here? Like in the old incurred loss model, there was some general reserve that you could have. And I'm just wondering, as we go through this recession and we have maybe some asset classes are experiencing greater than expected loss, others less than expected loss, can you shift the reserves around? And the question really ends up being, how fungible are the reserves that you put up against these specific asset classes that you've identified? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Clarke, I'll start, if you want to, maybe add to it. But, I mean we do it both ways, Betsy, and that we do a bottom-up analysis. So, our modelers go through, when we model, all of the portfolios, and we've brought it against the scenario, and we come up with a bottom-up analysis. Given the limitations of the models and the uncertainty in the environment, there's always top-down adjustments that occur that are basically in play there. So, it's really -- it's a process you go through. And you have to know what you have in the models today. If the economy gets better and everything else stays the same, you could see a release potentially. But, that's not reality. Things are always changing. Things are always getting regarded, up and down in the portfolio. Client behaviors are changing, more charge-offs or whatever. So, it's always a dynamic process. I think, Clarke and his team do a great job in analyzing it. We thoroughly review it several times before we come with our numbers each quarter. So, it's just -- it's hard to predict right now especially with the uncertainty how high the economic variables are today and the model limitations out there, there's a lot of qualitative adjustments occurring right now. Mark?\nClarke Starnes: No, no, I think, you said it well, Daryl. I think, it's very granular by segment, and that segment analysis in our view of the economy and the impact on all of that does allow us to adjust the estimate as needed. And so, you could have differences quarter-to-quarter by those different segments. And that could impact the level of the estimate.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. My question goes to slide 12 where the efficiency trends have not gone the right direction the last couple of quarters, but you just gave guidance for that to improve in the fourth quarter. You talked about personnel savings, CRE, branch, third-party systems and closing 104 branches. So, I think I'm summarizing what I heard. So, my question is, why not more, why not faster? This is one of the biggest merger overlaps that you've seen. You're allowed to close branches starting in December. Yesterday, U.S. Bancorp said they're going to close 300 branches, and you just said you're going to close about 100 branches. It just seems like you could do a lot more. And are you being too safe to get the merger integration smooth? I mean, you are growing deposits, no blow ups, and I'm sure you're protecting the long-term franchise. But, I thought that efficiency story would be coming in a little sooner than it's come in. Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: So Mike, I'll start with that, and others can help me finish the answer. So, I'll start with -- we have five buckets of cost savings. You started with the branch system. So, we are closing 104 branches, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the December-January time frame. I also said that we're looking at opportunities to pull forward some other branch closures in 2021. We aren't at the stage yet to announce exactly what we're going to do there. But, we did give you an indication that there is a possibility, and we wouldn't have said that if it wasn't a strong reality that we're going to pull forward a significant piece of some branch closures in 2021. We'll give you that once we are able to do that. If you look at our third-party spend, the third-party providers, to date, right now, with -- dealing with vendors, our sourcing and procurement teams have basically realized $266 million of savings from that. We think that run rate translates into about $300 million in 2021. They are not at their goals yet. They're still trying to get more savings. We think that will occur over the next year or so. We hope those numbers will exceed $400 million before it's all said and done from a run rate perspective. As contracts come up, as we redeploy, we're still going through the process of negotiating contracts with an end provider of these services that we are having right now. So everything can be fully negotiated yet. Next one would be in our non-branch facilities. We talked about that in our last earnings call. We have 29 million square feet outstanding, if you add branches and non-branches out there. We talked about potentially taking 5 million square feet out in our non-branch areas this next year. We said the average cost of that on a gross basis was $30 a square foot. There will be a little bit of investment come back as we refit under the socially distanced areas and all that for the buildings that are surviving. We have branches that will probably have another 2 million to 3 million square feet there. So, we'll be close to 20 million square feet probably by the end of 2021 in our company from that perspective. So, that's a third that we're taking out very aggressively, very quickly. The fourth area is in technology. I talked about it in the prepared remarks. We're just now getting in the midst of getting through conversions. We've done some small conversions, not client facing, and we started to decommission systems, started to get systems there. We just did a conversion in those area in capital markets, large corporate area and all that stuff. So, those savings are going to be captured. As we get through conversions in the first quarter in Joe's area with wealth and broker dealer that we have there in that, one is in the first quarter, the other one is second quarter. It takes probably three to six months before we get through and get those systems decommissioned. Scott has plans to -- we don't need 4 data centers right now. We're going to end up with a couple of data centers at the end of the day. That will probably be a '22 savings. So, we will get those savings. It's just a matter of when we are able to get those closed and get everything transferred. And the last one on personnel. If you look at our FTEs, every quarter, they have been falling in FTEs that we pulled forward FTEs. As we go through these conversions, we're going to have continued FTE closures. I mean, we don't need as much of areas on the support side as we go through these conversions and get things finalized. So, there's a lot to come. We are not backing down from the $1.6 billion. We aren't backing down from the timing, where we're going to come through on target like we said we were, and this is just a way of doing it.\nKelly King: And Mike, just to amplify, your question is a good one. It's appropriate about the branches. But two points. Up to this point, we have been cautious in terms of closing branches because we want to have -- we wanted to have maximum availability for our clients. Keep in mind that we've had to basically close down the lobbies. And now, we're fortunate about 98-plus percent of our branches have drive-thrus. So, our drive-thrus have been open throughout. For the last several months, we've had in-branch activity based on phones [ph] only. We just opened up this week like 1,500 branches full-service and the lobbies. So, once we get the branches back to kind of normal and our client service capability is back to normal, then, we will be more aggressive in terms of the closings. Because we have a large number of branches that are literally side to side, actually, in many cases, sharing the many parking lot, and our people, as Daryl alluded, are literally in the process of developing an aggressive plan with regard to that. So, don't hear us say we're not going to be best in with regard with branch closures. But, we're not just going to announce it today because they're literally in the process of putting final touches on what it's going to look like.\nMike Mayo: And then, one follow-up. Just to put a bow around it, how much in merger cost savings do you have so far in the third quarter run rate, and what do you expect for 2021 and 2022 again?\nDaryl Bible: So, for the third quarter, we're probably around 35%, give or take. We're still targeting 40% in the fourth quarter. The guidance that we gave is in the middle of that range that I gave you there, so plus or minus on that side of that. For the end of fourth quarter of '21, we're still at 65% of the $1.6 billion, and then the whole $1.6 billion by the end of 2022. So, we are not changing the timing of that.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Saul Martinez from UBS.\nSaul Martinez: Good morning. Following up a little bit on NII, Daryl, Ken. Daryl, what is embedded in your fourth quarter core NIM -- reported NIM guidance for PPP forgiveness, if anything? And can you just remind us or give us an update as to what you are thinking right now for forgiveness rates over, I guess, the next three quarters? And, any color on what the sort of the fee rate is on that forgiveness because, obviously, it does move the needle a bit on NII with that accelerated forgiveness.\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So, what I would say, when we talked about this last quarter, our estimate hasn't really changed and that we still think 75% of it will pay off with this forgiveness piece. That's a guesstimate. We really don't know. We are, like I said earlier, sending invitations out to everybody from that. For this fourth quarter, of that 75%, we're probably around 20%, but a shot in the dark of what actually might get paid off. We really don't know the timing. If you look at the news that came out last week from the SBA and the two-pager for the $50,000 and less, the numbers on that is out of our 80,000 clients, we have 45,000 clients that are $50,000 or less, but it only represents 7% of the dollars. So, it's a huge volume piece. So hopefully, a lot of that -- most of that will probably get processed very quickly. But, we've actually gone through and done some forgiveness on a limited basis, just to learn the process. And we've actually gotten paid from the SBA on a couple. So, we're learning and gearing up, and we're getting ready to do it holistically out to everybody at once, once we got the processes all lined up. So, we're gearing up for that. We think the first quarter, Saul, will be our biggest quarter. Right now, the estimate is around 60% and the rest would be in second quarter. But you really don't know. I mean, it's timing of it is -- it's a pure shot in the dark, but that's what's in our numbers right now.\nSaul Martinez: Right. And I know it's more tilted towards the first quarter. But, does your fourth quarter guidance explicitly incorporate that 20% forgiveness in certain fee rate on top of that? I know I'm getting a little bit nitpicky here, but if we kind of strip that out -- yes. Okay.\nDaryl Bible: There's risk. I mean, if it's less than 20, we may miss 4; if it's more than 20, we may exceed 4. But that will be the only end [indiscernible] other variables. But that is an assumption that plays out, absolutely, there. Maybe the other thing you have to think about, Saul -- sorry, when can you realize it just. Because somebody sends it in, do you realize it, when they send it in or when actually they get the dollars wired back into us? So, we're working with our external auditors and the timing of when we recognize that payoffs.\nSaul Martinez: Right. Without PPP forgiveness, can you maintain core NIM swap or is it pretty much impossible to do that, given the environment?\nDaryl Bible: My guess is that the core margin without PPP is probably in the high 260s right now. That would be my guess, maybe still 270. I mean, it all depends on what Kelly said, the loan growth, the ability to grow the higher yielding portfolios and really get a mix change. If we could just mix, invest some of the excess liquidity that we have in loans versus securities or Fed balances, that's a really positive way to help your core margin. It's just a matter of trying to get the loan volume to support that.\nSaul Martinez: Just one final quickie, just absolutely, just want to make sure. The guidance for expenses and revenue, that is based on the adjusted noninterest expense number of 3,147 and incorporates the adjusted noninterest income, I guess, of 2,106. Just want to clarify that.\nDaryl Bible: Yes. In my prepared remarks, I adjusted both, the expense side and the revenue side.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. I just wanted to make sure. Thank you.\nRyan Richards: That concludes our Q&A session. Thank you, Vijay. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I apologize for those with questions we didn't have time to get to. We're happy to reach out to you later today to address those questions. We wish you all the best. Goodbye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your call.",

            "name": "Kelly King",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everybody. I really appreciate you all joining our call. And I hope you and your family are doing well. Now, I would say, relative to the challenges that we're all facing, we're really happy to report what I call a great quarter, strong balance sheet, particularly an asset quality, liquidity and capital, relatively strong earnings, great value proposition for our clients, particularly in our digital offerings, great team, which I am extraordinarily proud of and a strong commitment to our communities and other stakeholders. We are, as you know, from our previous conversations, really focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. And I want to show on slide 5, a few of the things we're doing to live out our purpose. So, we announced recently something we're very excited about a $40 million donation to help establish an organization called CornerSquare Community Capital. This is a new organization that will be focusing on funding to racially and ethnically diverse small business owners, women and individuals, and LMI communities. This will be done through CDFIs, community development financial institutions, and it's a very exciting opportunity to get funds exactly where they're needed. We're real proud of our first Truist CSR report. I hope you've had a chance to read it. We launched recently, our Truist Momentum, which is continuation of a SunTrust program that focuses on financial wellbeing. We partnered with EverFi to introduce -- this is something we're very excited about a game called WORD Force, which helps kids in K-2, learn how to read. You've heard me say in the past, unfortunately, in our country today, two thirds of the kids in the public school system in the third grade cannot read. This is a way of getting at that. It may not be the all-in answer, but it's a really good start. We're excited about it. We're in our beta test, but we already have over 4,000 students and over 200 schools participating. We are doing a really good job in terms of conservation of energy, water and making good progress on a number of areas like that, investing in those areas to make our climate and our environment better. We did, as you know, announce as part of the merger, our $60 billion Community Benefits Plan over the next three years. We're very excited about that. As you can see on the slide, a number of areas that we're really committed to. I would particularly point out that we will be investing in loans and/or investments $32 billion over the next three years in home purchase mortgage loans and to LMI and minority borrowers. So, this is a big part of helping to deal with some of the social injustice and racial inequity problems that we have in our country, and a number of other programs that you can see there. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to improving our diversity. We said in our CSR report that we have committed, over the next three years to improve our senior leadership diversity from 12% in 2019 to 15%. You can see there that we have a very good and effective diverse Board with 45% being women and minorities. So, we feel really good about that. I'd also point out we were honored to receive a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2020 Corporate Equality Index. So, we're doing a really good job with regard to living our purpose. If you look at slide 6, I'd just point out a few highlights, we did have taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion. Net income available to common shareholders of $1 billion, but adjusted net income available to common was $1.3 billion. That resulted in diluting earnings per share on adjusted of $0.97. Return on average tangible common equity adjusted was 16.0%, very strong, and a really good efficiency ratio adjusted at 57.3%. We were really pleased about our nonperforming assets at 0.26%. And we recognize that there's more to come with regard to credit quality deterioration, depending on what happens with regard to the economy. But still, given where we are today and recognizing there are some positive impacts with regard to accommodations there, that's a really good number. We feel really good about that. And likewise, our net charge-offs were 0.42%, at the low end of what we had talked about. We're very pleased that our common equity Tier 1 is now at 10%. So, we feel really good about our capital position. If you look at some selective items on slide 7, I'd just point out we did have security gains of $104 million, which was a positive $0.06 per share. We had merger and restructuring charges of $236 million, which is $0.13. We did have incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Remember, these are expenses that don't qualify for MRRC [ph] in terms of calling out because they do have future benefits, but they're not a part of our longer term run rate. That was $152 million, and that was $0.08. And we did make a $50 million unusual contribution to our charitable foundation, and that was $0.03. So, if you put all that together, it was a negative impact to EPS of about $0.18. So, we feel good about the adjusted number because of the quality of these selected items. On slide eight, just a couple of comments with regard to loans. As you all know, loans are a real challenge for us and for the industry now because of what's going on in the economy. Of course, we did see a big run-up in loans in the second quarter. And likewise, we saw a big rundown in loans into third, as a large number of the corporate line draw-downs were repaid. So, we saw total loan reductions of $11 billion. $9.5 billion of that was in the C&I area. So, that's principally what happened. We did have some bright spots. We had growth in LightStream, our national consumer digital platform. Sheffield had a growth, recreational lending, prime auto. We did have some decreases in some other consumer areas, like resi mortgage and so forth. So, it's kind of a mixed bag with regard to consumer. But overall, the big story in loans is, if you exclude the run-up in balances in the second and the run-down in the third was relative flat. I would say to you that we do expect future headwinds. With regard to the PPP loans, we have about $12.5 billion there. That will begin to pay off as we head into the fourth and the first and probably the second. Loan growth is really challenging now, obviously. But, banks are a reflection of the economy. And so, we should not be surprised about that. The real question is what's going to happen to the economy. I would just point out, and this is just one person's opinion. It's important to look back at previous corrections that we've had. And there's virtually all ways of material precipitating event. So, in 1991, we had the commercial real estate bubble; 2001, we had the technology bubble; 2008, we had the residential real estate bubble; this one didn't have a bubble. This was a very strong 10-year economy, 3.5% unemployment rate. We just shut it down, appropriately so for medical reasons, but we shut it down. I'll make that point to say that if this pandemic doesn't go on too much longer, there's a chance that we can get a snap back in the economy that most people would not expect, because it wasn't structurally in trouble to start with. Now, if it stays on a long time, then all bets are off. I personally believe, as we head into the first quarter, we'll begin to see some real developments with regard to bank names. We certainly have already had substantial developments, positive developments with regard to medical -- mitigation of ramification. So, we are somewhat optimistic, although cautious, as we think about the economy going forward. I will tell you, as I get feedback from our client-facing people, while they're not facing them in person as much today, we're talking to people more probably than we ever did now, although virtually. David Weaver, who runs our Commercial Community Bank, told me the other day, he had nine calls in one day. So, we've been very, very efficient. But to his point, clients are being very resilient. I'm speaking particularly of middle and upper market. One of the quotes that I got recently was clients to say, it's time to move on. And to be honest, that's kind of what we said. We set back for a while and didn't make virtual calls and said we were waiting for the pandemic. And then several months ago, we just kind of said, we got to get on with running our business because our clients need us. So, our clients are being today is there saying kind of my business is okay. Now, the small -- very small micro end is struggling. And depending on how long this lasts, we will see a substantial shakeout in the small business, micro market. At the aggregate economic level, that will reshuffle and reallocate itself. But at a personal level for those small business people, that's a very sad story. So, we've got to hope that this moves along as rapidly as possible. I'll say finally that our pipelines are improving. Our calling activity is robust. And we feel very good about where we're going relative to what happens to the economy. On slide 9, just a brief comment about deposits, which are doing great. We continue to have a nice inflow, somewhat because of the flight to quality. We had $1.4 billion increase in deposits on a linked-quarter basis. We had a $10 billion increase following other previous quarter increases in noninterest-bearing deposits. So, we feel really good about that. Our noninterest-bearing deposits today are 33.3% of total deposits versus 27.8% in the first quarter. So, you can see how rapidly our DDA or noninterest-bearing deposits have increased. We've been focusing a lot of attention with regard to getting our cost down, with regard to our deposit structure. And we've made really good progress. Our total deposit costs decreased from 12 basis points to 10 basis points. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 17 basis points, down to 15 basis points. So, really good progress in managing our cost of deposits. I would point out, if you're following the math and all of our deposit activity there, we did divest $2.2 billion in deposits this quarter. And so, that's a material factor. So overall, I would say our deposits are doing great. With that, let me turn it to Daryl for some more detail. Thanks, Daryl. If you follow along on slide '21, I would say to you, generally, the merger is on track. Integration and conversion, we feel really good about where we are. We're making really great progress. Most importantly, our culture is really strong. And I would say to you kind of interestingly that the COVID experience has actually bonded our team together even faster than we would have expected, because when you go through a really, really tough time and you're kind of thrown in the boat together, it encourages our strength in terms of development relationships, trust and bonding. So, we could not feel better about how strong our culture is and how well it is developing. Some very notable activities in terms of the integration and conversion, we did complete the branch divestiture, as I mentioned. We recently announced something we're very excited about, what we call Truist Ventures. This is where we are making relatively small, but important investments in technology platforms that we can build into our value proposition. We are testing now for our client conversion at wealth and mortgage, which will come up in the spring. So, there will be a number of conversions that have occurred or will occur on the way towards the core conversion. We did launch our dual service branch pilots. This is a technical theme, but it's very important as we move down the road, as Daryl alluded to, in terms of accelerating our branch closings as we head into next year. Very importantly, we did complete our end-to-end Truist Securities conversion. This is a big deal. As we know, this is the first virtual conversion that has occurred, and it was seamless. Our people did a fantastic job. And it's a big deal because we are really big securities operation now, backing up our corporate and investment banking business. Core conversion is on track for the first half of '22. So, we feel good about where everything is with regard to integration and conversion. If you look at slide 22, just a word about our value proposition as we wrap up. We are, as I said in the beginning, driven by our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. Our goal long term is to grow earnings with less volatility relative to our peers over the long term. That's kind of the commitment we made to our shareholders. We base that on a very exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. As we said, we are the sixth largest commercial bank in the U.S. today that gives us scale to be able to compete. We're very strong in our marketplace, and that gives us the efficiency that we need. We are the sixth largest insurance broker. We have really strong growth there. I think, we're going to report a 5.3% organic growth, which we believe will probably top in the market. We're the number one regional bank on investment firm; we're the number two regional bank originator -- mortgage originator and servicer. So, very, very strong franchise. We're really positioned well to be best-in-class in terms of efficiency and returns. At the same time, we'll be investing heavily in the future. As Daryl said, we are confident in achieving our $1.6 billion of net cost savings. At the same time, we'll be investing in our revenue synergy operation. I would tell you that our IRM, our integrated relationship management strategy, is going great. As you know, in the beginning, we've said there were huge opportunities to leverage the strength that SunTrust had and the strength BB&T had. And I would say that is ahead of schedule. The receptivity of our people with regard to cross-selling, if you will, these products and services across the organization is robust. And frankly, there's just a lot of enthusiasm about it. We are making key investments in technology, in our teammates, in marketing and in advertising, all of which will drive our above-average organic growth and long term, stable and growing profitability. At the same time, we have a very strong capital base, as you can see, very strong liquidity and a very resilient risk profile. We're very prudent, disciplined in risk in financial management. We have a very conservative risk culture. We have heard diversified benefits arising from the merger that was just kind of naturally implicit in the merger. We've stressed that very well, as you've seen, with very strong capital, very strong liquidity. And we have a very strong and defensive balance sheet, which is insulated by purchase accounting marks, combined with the CECL credit reserve. So, overall, I would say we have a great culture. We have a great franchise. We have a great team. And we fully believe -- I fully believe our best days are ahead. Ryan? So, Ken, we still feel confident over the long term and the original expectation of low 20s ROTCE. Remember, we're already very, very strong in the environment that we're in today. And as Daryl described, we're really just getting started in terms of getting the long-term investment -- investments made and related expense reductions that will follow. And then, of course, you've got all the revenue synergies that I alluded to. So, we are very, very good about that. Obviously, we'll ebb and flow some based on the economy. But, that's still a reasonable number for Q4. So, Mike, we're really happy to be at 10%. And as you know, we have said that, that was our target. So, that's a very comfortable position. As we think about it going forward, it's really a function of, of course, when we're actually able to do buybacks and dividend increases. But, the way we think about it is about risk projection. And so, if we look forward and we feel like the economy has stabilized and growing, if we look forward in terms of the pandemic, it's under control, and we can feel comfortable in terms of a projected relatively stable, less volatile, growing revenue streams, then we'll feel comfortable in terms of turning back on buybacks and considering dividend increases. I'd say, today, it's just premature. We just don't know what we don't know. And to go out there today and try to make those kind of assumptions, I think, is shooting in the dark. I do think as we head into next year, we'll see clarity with regard to the pandemic. We'll see clarity with regard to the economy. As I said earlier, I think the chance is that economy will still be better than the most things. So, there's a decent chance we'll have that decision to make as we head into the, let's call it, first half of next year. But today, it's just a tad premature. Well, Gerard, that's something else, we don't know. But I think today that some of course have already gone away. I mean, they couldn't -- for whatever reason, they couldn't qualify by the stimulus. They chose not to. They just threw in the towel. But that's a small percentage. Most have been buoyed by the stimulus support, PPP and other loan assistance programs. As that begins to phase out, these businesses will have tougher decisions to make. But, I'll tell you that a lot of these small businesses are pretty creative. I mean, they're pretty resilient. And so, I wouldn't expect to see a majority of small businesses fold or anywhere close to that. I think, most are going to find ways to reinvent their business. It's incredible how smart all business people are. That -- basically, my whole career, and they're pretty tough group. So, I wouldn't write them off. I'm just saying that it has gone into the second quarter and [indiscernible] someone back out buying again, and we will see a shakeout. Here's the thing today, consumer purchases are back up. The credit card activity, I mean, it's up year-over-year. So, it went through a trough. It's back up year-over-year. So, they're buying, but buying in different ways. So, what these small businesses have to do is figure out whether it's carryout or dine out in the backyard or whatever it is if you're a restaurant. The creative ones will figure it out. Some won't be able to figure it out, and they'll have to find another career. But, I think that all will begin to be clear, Gerard, as we head into the second quarter. Well, a couple of other things. Keep in mind that our people have been very successful in terms of floors with regard to new loans and existing renewals. The other thing is that if the economy comes back faster, which I think it may, there's going to be a substantial pent-up demand for expansions. And so, we will see an increase in loan demand for, I call it, normally priced loans, which will be a plus to grow the NIM. So a couple of things there could really help us on NIM in addition to what Daryl said. One of the things, kind of interesting -- so to your point, if everything were precise, as I understand it, the economy performs as we expected in terms of our CECL projections, rates are as we projected, so our net present value is the same as projected, if all of that would happen, it would be a hands down correlation between reserve reductions productions and [indiscernible] But as Clarke said, it's not going to be 100% correlation. And the other thing is, and I hope this is not true, but do we get any pressure from the regulators to hold theirs up even though all the math and all the concepts say should be coming down? We've not heard think about that, but that's how the way it goes. And Mike, just to amplify, your question is a good one. It's appropriate about the branches. But two points. Up to this point, we have been cautious in terms of closing branches because we want to have -- we wanted to have maximum availability for our clients. Keep in mind that we've had to basically close down the lobbies. And now, we're fortunate about 98-plus percent of our branches have drive-thrus. So, our drive-thrus have been open throughout. For the last several months, we've had in-branch activity based on phones [ph] only. We just opened up this week like 1,500 branches full-service and the lobbies. So, once we get the branches back to kind of normal and our client service capability is back to normal, then, we will be more aggressive in terms of the closings. Because we have a large number of branches that are literally side to side, actually, in many cases, sharing the many parking lot, and our people, as Daryl alluded, are literally in the process of developing an aggressive plan with regard to that. So, don't hear us say we're not going to be best in with regard with branch closures. But, we're not just going to announce it today because they're literally in the process of putting final touches on what it's going to look like."

            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to cover highlights from the third quarter and provide our fourth quarter outlook. Turning to slide 10. Reported net interest margin decreased 3 basis points, primarily due to lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin increased 5 basis points, the first increase since the first quarter of 2019. Core margin benefited from strong DDA growth, lower funding costs, lower COVID-related deferred interest. Lower yields on loans and securities remain a headwind. During the quarter, we used excess reserves to purchase $5 billion of high-quality securities, improving our yield on those assets by approximately 100 basis points. Our asset sensitivity increased in the third quarter, and we plan to stay slightly asset sensitive. We will continue to protect our margin by placing rate floors on commercial loans and manage deposit costs. Due to our excess funding position, we are being strategic about deposit costs by focusing on growing noninterest-bearing deposits. Given the low rate environment, we are placing pay fixed swaps to partially hedge our investment securities and associated changes in OCI. We expect the reported net interest margin to slightly decrease for the remainder of the year. Turning to slide 11. Adjusted noninterest income was relatively flat versus a robust second quarter. Fee income categories impacted by the pandemic continued to improve. Our activity on deposits is normalizing, coupled with lower fee waivers. Card and payment-related fees increased as payment volumes improved. Wealth management income increased as a result of higher market valuations. Despite the seasonally weak quarter, insurance income grew 6.4% on a like-quarter basis due to firmer pricing and an uptick in new business. Residential mortgage income decreased, primarily due to a $72 million change in the net MSR valuation, driven by higher prepayments. Investment banking had a record quarter, but trading was off from a great second quarter, resulting in lower revenue. Other income increased due to the increase in the value of nonqualified plan assets and other investments. Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expense decreased $123 million as losses on debt extinguishment and higher intangible amortization during the second quarter were partially offset by higher merger-related costs and a charitable contribution. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $20 million, primarily due to an increased personnel expense, marketing costs and professional services. The increase in personnel expense reflects higher nonqualified plan costs that were offset by other income, higher medical costs due to normalization, pension cost adjustment and a reduced labor cost capitalization due to lower loan volume. Truist remains highly disciplined on core expenses. Average FTEs decreased 769 during the quarter, and we expect further reductions this year. We plan to close 104 branches in December and January and are looking at ways to bring forward more branch closures in 2021. Turning to slide 13. Asset quality ratios remained relatively stable. The NPA ratio increased 1 basis point to 26 basis points, and the NPL ratio increased 2 basis points to 37 basis points, primarily due to C&I loans. Annualized net charge-offs relative to average loans and leases increased 3 basis points to 42 basis points. We took a $97 million PCD adjustment to net charge-offs. Excluding that, net charge-offs would have been 29 basis points. The provision of $421 million exceeded net charge-offs of $326 million, increasing an allowance by $95 million. The allowance was 1.91% of loans and leases, up from 1.81%. Coverage ratios remained strong at 4.52 times net charge-offs and 2 -- 5.22 times nonperforming loans. The combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value work remains very robust at 2.76% of total loans. Turning to slide 14. Our exposure to sensitive industries continues to decline to a low of 9.1% of loans held for investment. Outstanding balances to sensitive industries decreased $2.2 billion to $27.9 billion. We continue to closely monitor and manage our sensitive industry portfolios. Turning to slide 15. The volume of loans with the accommodations have decreased significantly since June 30th. Approximately $692 million of commercial loans had an active activation at the end of September 30, down from $21.2 billion. In consumer, $6.2 billion had active accommodation, down from $11.3 billion. The declines reflect expiration of the initial payment relief, which was not renewed by the borrower. Since June 30th, approximately 98% of the commercial borrowers and 94.5% of the consumer borrowers who exited payment relief, either paid off their balance or are in current status. Turning to slide 16. The allowance for credit losses increased $96 million to reflect loan re-grading uncertainty related to the expiration of government stimulus programs. Our economic assumptions include extended GDP recovery, high-single-digit unemployment through mid-2021, followed by continued improvement through the remaining reasonable and supportable forecast period. Our ACL estimates also reflect qualitative adjustments for model limitations, government stimulus, accommodation and the review of SNC. Turning to slide 17. Capital ratios improved for the second straight quarter and are strong relative to regulatory requirements. Our reported CET1 ratio increased to 10% from 9.7% last quarter. We also issued $925 million of preferred stock to strengthen our Tier 1 and total capital ratios. The recent assigned stress capital buffer of 270 basis points remained in effect until September when a revised stress capital buffer will be provided. We plan to submit our capital plan in early November as required by the Federal Reserve. Our purpose of capital priorities continues to be organic growth and our dividend. We remain open to bolt-on acquisitions with fee income businesses. Turning to slide 18. Liquidity remains strong with an LCR ratio of 117% and liquid asset buffer of 18.6%. Our access to secured funding sources is robust with over $200 billion of cash, securities and secured borrowings. Parent company is sufficient to cover 22 months of contractual and expected outflows with no inflows. Turning to slide 19. We continue to see strong growth in digital banking. Truist opened up 56,000 net new accounts versus 15,000 last quarter, driven by digital and increased branch traffic. For the 12 months through August, we experienced a 21% increase in digital sales, 8% increase in active mobile users, 23% increase in mobile check deposits and a 5% increase in statement suppression. We are also proud of the recognition we received recently from Javelin. Heritage BB&T was recognized as a leader in ease-of-use and financial fitness in mobile banking and a leader in financial fitness in online banking. Heritage SunTrust was recognized as a leader in ease-of-use and online banking. These awards demonstrate the strength of our heritage platforms and the opportunities as Truist advances digital capabilities. Turning to slide 20. As we have said, our primary reason for the merger is to exceed client expectations through seamless integration of touch and technology to create trust. To get there, we are harvesting cost saves from combined companies to fund increased investment and ultimately drive best-in-class performance. We are fully committed to achieving $1.6 billion in net cost saves and continue to make good progress on personnel expense, corporate real estate, branch rationalization, third-party spend and system decommissioning and data center closures. At the same time, we are also investing in digital, marketing and technology. We are also investing in talent, including areas outside of digital and our revenue businesses. Together, these investments and cost saves will allow us to generate best-in-class returns versus our peers while providing distinctive, secure and successful client experiences through touch and technology. Now, I will provide our fourth quarter guidance, which is based on linked-quarter changes versus the third quarter where our guidance provides a path to positive operating leverage. We expect taxable equivalent revenue, excluding onetime security gains to be down 1% to 3%, driven by lower purchase accounting accretion. We expect reported net interest margin to be down 3 to 5 basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion and core margin to be relatively flat. Core noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization is expected to be down 2% to 4%, reflecting lower personnel expense. We also anticipate net charge-offs to between 40 and 60 basis points. Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for a merger update, closing remarks, and Q&A. Yes. So, Ken, what I would tell you is, is that we are still on the uptick in our merger and MOE-related expenses. We are just going through the developing phases of that. Testing starts in the first quarter as we start with kit testing and then we go onto UAT testing as we get ready for client day one in early part of 2022. So, I would say, we're still on the uptick there. To-date, since we announced the transaction in February '19, we have about $1.5 billion of combined MRRC and MOE-related expenses. And at that time, we said we would be at $2 billion. I don't have a number of what it is going yet. We will probably give that to you in January. We will probably exceed that number sometime in the first quarter, the $2 billion number. I want to give you a number and make sure we hit the number that I gave you in our earnings call in January from that standpoint. So, we're coming through figuring all that out, and we'll get back to you on that. But, I would say, we'll still stay elevated for the next several quarters as we -- and we have thousands and thousands of people right now working on hundreds of systems, getting them ready, getting them tested. And we just got to make sure this is flawless. And we have to be -- have a great client experience, we have to make sure everything goes right. It costs a little bit of money. You have to remember, Ken, on this, we chose to choose the better of the two when we had our choices. We didn't take the easy way out and just convert everything all one way or the other. So, for a commercial platform, we chose to use the heritage BB&T servicing system, AFS, coupled with the heritage SunTrust and CNO piece. That takes a lot more time, a lot more complexity. But, when we get it done, we will be so far better. We're doing it in the retail banking platform as well where we have the BB&T heritage deposit system, coupled with heritage SunTrust automated teller. Again, more complexity. But when we get through all this in '22, we will be light years ahead of most of our peers because of what we're doing from that. So, it's the right thing to do. It costs a lot of money to do it. We're going to do it right and we're going to execute. Yes. So, Michael, I'll take the PCD question, then I'll pick to Clarke, and he can maybe answer the accommodation piece of it. So on the PCD, remember, when we closed in December, we closed under the -- now what I would say, old accounting method where we had to set up PCI. When CECL came in into January, we went from PCI to PCD. In that process, we went through -- we grossed up loans and carrying values in connection with the establishment of PCD of our best estimates. As we -- as the year played out, what we realized is we grossed up the loans, and we should have not gross them up to the full value. They should have been today charged off from that perspective. So, it was an adjustment that we made this quarter. We think we've gone through the book, and we've caught everything there. So, in essence, we would have just had a different number in the first quarter when we got our CECL numbers. But, it was an adjustment that we made. It's a noncash item. And we had really good charge-off. If you exclude that $29 million we had good charge-off, even if you add that in, it's $42 million. Both beat guidance. Yes. So, Gerard, so our current duration of our portfolio because of prepayment speeds picked up were just a tad over 3 years right now, 3.1. But, they do have negative convexities. So, it is -- can move in and out from that perspective. What I would say is, that we are in the midst of moving some more of our liquidity that we have -- in fact, we have a little over $30 billion at the Fed. Currently, we are moving that over, some of it this quarter, maybe more of it into early next year. We are layering in some hedges. Now, I would tell you, the hedges that we're putting on are pay fixed hedges. We're buying mortgage back, which as you know, has cash flows that paid out over the life of those assets. The way FASB has approved a hedge accounting on this, it's only allowed to use bullet swaps. They do have a task force that they are working on, trying to look for other ways to allow for this -- it's called last layer of hedging, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to put on a little stronger hedges. But the hedges we're putting on will mute some of the OCI volatility. If they get come through and allow us to use maybe amortizing swaps instead of just bullet swaps, that would significantly improve the performance of those hedges. So, we're hopeful about that. But, we are trying to hedge it the best that we can. Right now the costs of these pay fixed swaps are really low at 12 basis points. So it doesn't really impact it. So, we are in the midst of moving over. I always look at it as an opportunity cost right now. We could have lower rates for the next three years. That's what's in the forecast, five years, you just don't know. And I think it's good to be deployed. The way I would think of it, though is that if rates were to go up or we started to lose some of the search deposits, our cash flows from this investment portfolio we're building could be easily $10 billion a quarter. So, we could just not reinvest. If we have strong loan growth, we could use that cash flow to deploy into loan growth. So, it gives us a lot more flexibility, a lot more optionality. And it also helps protect our margin and help run rate. You pay us to run our company and do what we think is best. We think this is a good balanced approach to managing the company. Yes. So, I would tell you, we had a good drop in deposit cost this past quarter. We still think we have room to go there. So, our interest-bearing costs are 15%. My guess is over the next quarter or two, will be single digit. I think, that's just the direction that we're headed right now. I think that's a possibility. I think that will help. I think, as we can grow some of our consumer portfolio successfully, that will help mitigate some of our core margin. You have higher yields in those portfolios, and that would definitely help as we were able to be successful in growing that. And the other thing I would just tell you is that we are doing everything we can to protect our core margin and try to grow as much as we can to offset the runoff. The runoff of purchase accounting is a little bit -- it's hard to predict. It depends on how the loans pay down on that. My guess right now is that it be down 3% to 5% right now, but you really don't know what's going to come through from that. You just have to do the best that you can with what's running off from that. But with PPP coming out over the next couple of quarters, that will help keep core margin probably in the 270s, and that will help mitigate the reduction of GAAP to what, depending how much you get PPP pay downs. Our guess is the bulk of our pay-downs will come in the first quarter or maybe second quarter. We'll get some this quarter. Recall, our company has about $12.5 billion of PPP loans on the books. We are planning to have invitations sent to all of our clients in the month of November, so they will all get invitations. How quickly they can respond with the documentation and we submit it to SBA is just a huge process. That's why we're thinking it's more centered in the first half of '21 than in this quarter, but you don't really know. It's an unknown right now. Clarke, do you want to take that or... Clarke, I'll start, if you want to, maybe add to it. But, I mean we do it both ways, Betsy, and that we do a bottom-up analysis. So, our modelers go through, when we model, all of the portfolios, and we've brought it against the scenario, and we come up with a bottom-up analysis. Given the limitations of the models and the uncertainty in the environment, there's always top-down adjustments that occur that are basically in play there. So, it's really -- it's a process you go through. And you have to know what you have in the models today. If the economy gets better and everything else stays the same, you could see a release potentially. But, that's not reality. Things are always changing. Things are always getting regarded, up and down in the portfolio. Client behaviors are changing, more charge-offs or whatever. So, it's always a dynamic process. I think, Clarke and his team do a great job in analyzing it. We thoroughly review it several times before we come with our numbers each quarter. So, it's just -- it's hard to predict right now especially with the uncertainty how high the economic variables are today and the model limitations out there, there's a lot of qualitative adjustments occurring right now. Mark? So Mike, I'll start with that, and others can help me finish the answer. So, I'll start with -- we have five buckets of cost savings. You started with the branch system. So, we are closing 104 branches, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the December-January time frame. I also said that we're looking at opportunities to pull forward some other branch closures in 2021. We aren't at the stage yet to announce exactly what we're going to do there. But, we did give you an indication that there is a possibility, and we wouldn't have said that if it wasn't a strong reality that we're going to pull forward a significant piece of some branch closures in 2021. We'll give you that once we are able to do that. If you look at our third-party spend, the third-party providers, to date, right now, with -- dealing with vendors, our sourcing and procurement teams have basically realized $266 million of savings from that. We think that run rate translates into about $300 million in 2021. They are not at their goals yet. They're still trying to get more savings. We think that will occur over the next year or so. We hope those numbers will exceed $400 million before it's all said and done from a run rate perspective. As contracts come up, as we redeploy, we're still going through the process of negotiating contracts with an end provider of these services that we are having right now. So everything can be fully negotiated yet. Next one would be in our non-branch facilities. We talked about that in our last earnings call. We have 29 million square feet outstanding, if you add branches and non-branches out there. We talked about potentially taking 5 million square feet out in our non-branch areas this next year. We said the average cost of that on a gross basis was $30 a square foot. There will be a little bit of investment come back as we refit under the socially distanced areas and all that for the buildings that are surviving. We have branches that will probably have another 2 million to 3 million square feet there. So, we'll be close to 20 million square feet probably by the end of 2021 in our company from that perspective. So, that's a third that we're taking out very aggressively, very quickly. The fourth area is in technology. I talked about it in the prepared remarks. We're just now getting in the midst of getting through conversions. We've done some small conversions, not client facing, and we started to decommission systems, started to get systems there. We just did a conversion in those area in capital markets, large corporate area and all that stuff. So, those savings are going to be captured. As we get through conversions in the first quarter in Joe's area with wealth and broker dealer that we have there in that, one is in the first quarter, the other one is second quarter. It takes probably three to six months before we get through and get those systems decommissioned. Scott has plans to -- we don't need 4 data centers right now. We're going to end up with a couple of data centers at the end of the day. That will probably be a '22 savings. So, we will get those savings. It's just a matter of when we are able to get those closed and get everything transferred. And the last one on personnel. If you look at our FTEs, every quarter, they have been falling in FTEs that we pulled forward FTEs. As we go through these conversions, we're going to have continued FTE closures. I mean, we don't need as much of areas on the support side as we go through these conversions and get things finalized. So, there's a lot to come. We are not backing down from the $1.6 billion. We aren't backing down from the timing, where we're going to come through on target like we said we were, and this is just a way of doing it. So, for the third quarter, we're probably around 35%, give or take. We're still targeting 40% in the fourth quarter. The guidance that we gave is in the middle of that range that I gave you there, so plus or minus on that side of that. For the end of fourth quarter of '21, we're still at 65% of the $1.6 billion, and then the whole $1.6 billion by the end of 2022. So, we are not changing the timing of that. Yes. So, what I would say, when we talked about this last quarter, our estimate hasn't really changed and that we still think 75% of it will pay off with this forgiveness piece. That's a guesstimate. We really don't know. We are, like I said earlier, sending invitations out to everybody from that. For this fourth quarter, of that 75%, we're probably around 20%, but a shot in the dark of what actually might get paid off. We really don't know the timing. If you look at the news that came out last week from the SBA and the two-pager for the $50,000 and less, the numbers on that is out of our 80,000 clients, we have 45,000 clients that are $50,000 or less, but it only represents 7% of the dollars. So, it's a huge volume piece. So hopefully, a lot of that -- most of that will probably get processed very quickly. But, we've actually gone through and done some forgiveness on a limited basis, just to learn the process. And we've actually gotten paid from the SBA on a couple. So, we're learning and gearing up, and we're getting ready to do it holistically out to everybody at once, once we got the processes all lined up. So, we're gearing up for that. We think the first quarter, Saul, will be our biggest quarter. Right now, the estimate is around 60% and the rest would be in second quarter. But you really don't know. I mean, it's timing of it is -- it's a pure shot in the dark, but that's what's in our numbers right now. There's risk. I mean, if it's less than 20, we may miss 4; if it's more than 20, we may exceed 4. But that will be the only end [indiscernible] other variables. But that is an assumption that plays out, absolutely, there. Maybe the other thing you have to think about, Saul -- sorry, when can you realize it just. Because somebody sends it in, do you realize it, when they send it in or when actually they get the dollars wired back into us? So, we're working with our external auditors and the timing of when we recognize that payoffs. My guess is that the core margin without PPP is probably in the high 260s right now. That would be my guess, maybe still 270. I mean, it all depends on what Kelly said, the loan growth, the ability to grow the higher yielding portfolios and really get a mix change. If we could just mix, invest some of the excess liquidity that we have in loans versus securities or Fed balances, that's a really positive way to help your core margin. It's just a matter of trying to get the loan volume to support that. Yes. In my prepared remarks, I adjusted both, the expense side and the revenue side."

            "name": "Clarke Starnes",
            "content": "Clarke? Thanks, Daryl. Hey, Michael. As far as the sensitive entry, you see on the slide there we've got in the deck, we had a nice couple of billion dollar reduction this quarter. It's been a very-targeted effort to work with those borrowers and reduce the exposure. So, I would say the highlights of the quarter there is we worked very aggressively to get a handle on, particularly in the energy portfolio and hospitality side. We actually sold $300 million worth of hotel credits at pretty good pricing and also address good bit of the energy book. So to give you some context, nonperformers in that portfolio of sensitive industries are still less than 100 basis points. And we have less than 2% of those balances there in any kind of accommodation or deferral. So, I consider really strong progress, and we'll continue to watch that closely, and it's all considered in our reserves as well. John, this is -- yes, this is Clarke. I'll answer that, John. On the delinquency side, we typically see, in consumer anyway, some elevated early stage as you go through the second half of the year. So, third quarter is going up a little bit, part of that seasonal. You'll see a lot of it's concentrated in the government-guaranteed portfolios around student and mortgage. So, if you take that out, particularly for your 90-plus, that was the majority there. It was flat otherwise. So, again, nothing alarming at this point. We anticipate part of that each year. And to your second question, all of that is considered as we go through our modeling and our allowance and our view of the scenarios that we selected. So, yes, I think we've assumed there will be further deterioration as we move forward. This is very likely. And that's all been included in our estimate to date. Yes. Maybe I'll start and then Daryl or Kelly can kick in. I mean certainly, Betsy, we think it's premature to be talking about releases right now, given the environment. So, I think you'll see in our estimate this quarter we've been, I think, prudent around considering there's still a lot of economic uncertainty around whether there'll be any more stimulus, what the ultimate outcome of these accommodations are and just pace of the recovery. So, I think for us, we would want to be sure we have much better clarity there and see the economy on very firm ground and client performance be at a really strong level before I think you see us consider releases. No, no, I think, you said it well, Daryl. I think, it's very granular by segment, and that segment analysis in our view of the economy and the impact on all of that does allow us to adjust the estimate as needed. And so, you could have differences quarter-to-quarter by those different segments. And that could impact the level of the estimate."

Thank you very much for joining our call, and I hope you and your family are safe and well. Given the challenges that we face, I think this was a really strong quarter, primarily because we lived our purpose. And I will say I am really, really proud of our team. Our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. And that is really, really important in the challenging environment we are experiencing today. We focused intensely on taking care of our clients. I\u2019ve been really, really involved with our teammates, creating an inclusive and energizing environment, really focusing on trying to empower our teammates to learn and grow and have meaningful careers. And I think we\u2019ve done a good job across the board with regard to all of our stakeholders in optimizing their long-term returns. We do all that consistent with our values. We\u2019re trustworthy, caring, one team, success, and ultimately, trying to provide a sense of happiness for our teammates, and all of the people that we have a chance to inspire and support. If you\u2019re following the presentation, on Table 5, I just want to point out some of the things that we\u2019ve done, because I think in today\u2019s world, this is as important, if not, more important than the actual numbers, because our communities need a lot of help. We\u2019ve been really focused on living our purpose. You\u2019ve heard about our Truist Cares philanthropic initiative, where we pledge $50 million to rebuild communities. Some of the things we\u2019re doing are really, really exciting. For example, we\u2019re doing technological support in areas that are un-served or underserved with regard to Internet and WiFi capabilities. We\u2019re using that to support automated reading capabilities in these areas, because these kids are sheltered and placed at home, and don\u2019t have access easily to learning. We\u2019re supporting our communities, doing a lot of work with CDFIs in terms of supporting small businesses, minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, feel good about that. Just to give you a perspective, over the last few years on our onUp Movement, we provided about 6 million people with tools to provide the financial confidence. Since 2009, we\u2019ve done over 12,000 community projects. We\u2019ve touched over 18 million people through our Financial Foundations program, which is focused on financial literacy. In high schools, we\u2019ve reached over 1 million high school students. And since the merger of equals, in very short period of time, we\u2019ve provided $440 million in financing to support 2,200 affordable housing units, creating 1,400 new jobs across our footprint. We\u2019ve been really focused on addressing racial and social inequity. We are expanding our efforts to advance equity, economic empowerment and education for our clients, our communities and our teammates. I\u2019m very proud to say we observed Juneteenth holiday by giving our people time-off. We had a virtual town hall with our 3,000 of our teammates that I was able to co-host along with Ben Crump, and it was a really, really good dialog, good discussion. We\u2019ve had over 200 Days of Understanding, where we bring together our teammates and give them an opportunity to just dialog and talk about what\u2019s going on, challenges that they face. Those have been really, really great sessions. I participated in some and found them to be very, very informative and helpful. We\u2019re in the process of doing even more town halls. We conducted unconscious bias training. So, we\u2019re doing a lot to try to help our communities and our teammates weather through the storm and get better through the storm. And I feel really good about that. I\u2019ll show you how this is playing out. With regard to our second quarter highlights, on Slide 6, we\u2019re very pleased that we had taxable-equivalent revenue of $5.9 billion. It was up 7%. But as you know, that was merger timing affected. We did have adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, feel good about that. Our diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $0.67, but our adjusted basis earnings were $0.82, which was very, very strong relative to the environment. Our return on average common equity on adjusted basis was 7.26%. Return on average tangible common adjusted was 14.17%. And I was very pleased that our adjusted efficiency ratio was 55.8%, which is very strong in this environment. Our asset quality in terms of actual metrics, which you can get more detail on from Clark were actually fantastic. But as we all know, that was substantially impacted by a lot of the CARES Act decisions around forbearances, et cetera. So, we know that it will get worse. That\u2019s why we\u2019re prepared well in terms of our reserving for our future allowances. We felt good about fee income, robust capital markets activity. Residential mortgage was fantastic. Our insurance brokerage operation, which really, really, is important in times like these, had a record quarter. We continue to have very good expense discipline on a core basis. And our common equity tier 1 increased about 0.4% to 9.7%. So, we felt very, very good about that. If you look on Page 7, I just want to have a few of these material special items that affected the quarter. We did have securities gains. So, these were non-agency mortgage securities that we have for a while. They had special gains and some risk of downside loss for those gains. And so, there was a good opportunity for us to take those. That did provide $300 million of pre-tax gain or $0.17 a diluted share. Now, we use most of that to extinguish debt. We took a loss on debt of $235 million before tax. That improves forward run rate, which Daryl can give you detail on, but that was very good. That was a negative $0.13. We did have substantial merger-related and restructuring charges of $209 million that was $0.12 negative. And then, as we\u2019ve explained to you, we do have incremental operating expenses that are related to the merger. They\u2019re not technically merger-related that we call out in a category. But they\u2019re not a part of our run-rate going forward. So, we consider those to be unusual and that\u2019s $0.07. So, when you net through all that, it will be a positive impact of about $0.15. If you look at Slide 8, just a few comments with regard to loans, it was a very interesting quarter for loans. I mean, at the beginning of the quarter, loans were booming. We were having line draws like everybody else that were substantial. We were engaged in PPP, where we were the third largest PPP producer, producing about $13 billion in those loans. We were happy to do that, although it was very hard in terms of supporting our small business clients. There was not much normal loan activity in the quarter. So, it was just kind of an unusual quarter. Our average balances were $322 billion versus a $315 billion end of period. So, you can see what happened. We advanced up all the lines, and then they started paying down, so now 80% of the COVID-related line advances have already been paid. So that activity was kind of a roller coaster, it\u2019s settled down now, and we feel good about where we are. Consumer loans decreased slightly in this stressed environment just because people broadly speaking, are spending less. We did see a decrease in residential mortgage on the loans that we hold, but our mortgage business is generally booming. We had mortgage applications of $21.3 billion in second quarter and we originated $14.6 billion in the quarter. So, we were really, really active in that, and frankly, moving resources into the mortgage area, that\u2019s a very, very important area for us. We did have substantial activity increasing loans in indirect, which was primarily due to huge demand for loans to finance recreational and power sports. So, we are seeing some robust activity in some categories, some temporary robust activity in others. The underlying normal activity is, I\u2019d say, relatively stable, not going down, not going up. There\u2019s just not much going on right now on reasons you would understand. So, we feel overall good about our loan book and loan activity. And we think we\u2019re well positioned as we go forward with confident returns to be able to meet the needs of our clients. Just a couple of comments with regard to deposits on Slide 9. Deposits are booming. Our noninterest-bearing deposits were $113 billion, up $20.7 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Total deposits were $36 billion on the same linked-quarter basis. I will tell you that the majority of that is core, but there are search balances related to line draws, PPP loans and government stimulus. We believe there continues to be a flight to quality and we\u2019re the beneficiary of that. Business accounts drove about 80% of the growth in DDA. So that was what you would expect, businesses drawing on lines, investing into deposit accounts, et cetera. Our deposit mix for the second quarter consisted of 34.7% noninterest-bearing deposits, which is very strong, 26% on interest-bearing, 34% of money market, and savings were 8.9%. Our cost of average deposits and average interest-bearing deposits decreased 29 basis points and 38 basis points, respectively, down to 22 and 32, respectively. So, it\u2019s a very, very strong story for deposits, I will say that we have real opportunity in terms of our interest-bearing deposits at 32 basis points. We didn\u2019t move them down as aggressively in the second quarter, maybe some did. We\u2019ve wanted our clients have time to adjust. I would see there\u2019s a real opportunity for us as we move into third quarter, and we\u2019re already taking very bold and decisive action with regard to that. So, let me turn it now to Daryl for some more detail.\nDaryl Bible: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to cover key points from the second quarter, discuss current business conditions and provide an update on cost saves. Turning to Slide 10, net interest margin was 3.13%, down 45 basis points. Purchase accounting contributed 46 basis points to reported net interest margin versus 52 basis points last quarter. Core net interest margin was 2.67%, down 39 basis points impacted by lower benchmark interest rates, higher Fed balances, and COVID-related deferred interest. The yield on loans and leases held for investment decreased 81 basis points due to lower interest rates, lower purchase accounting accretion and deferred interest and loans with forbearance. The yield on the securities portfolio decreased 25 basis points primarily due to higher premium amortization. Asset sensitivity moderated as a result of higher fixed rate assets, lower fixed rate federal home loan bank advances and lower benchmark interest rates, mitigating down rate scenarios. We\u2019re projecting loan yields \u2013 well, we\u2019re protecting loan yields with rate floors on new commercial obligations and modifications, and we\u2019ll continue to manage down deposit costs. We expect to report net interest margin to be flat for the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 11, Noninterest income includes $300 million in security gains related to the sale of non-agency MBS, excluding these gains, core noninterest income was up $160 million. Investment banking and trading income increased $156 million on strong core trading activity and elevated counterparty reserves in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage income was up $96 million on strong volumes and improved margins, partially offset by lower servicing due to higher prepayments. Refi was 65% of originations and gain on sale was 319 basis points reflecting very favorable conditions in mortgage. Insurance income increased $32 million, up 5.8% to record levels, primarily due to seasonality and pricing. Organic revenue grew 2.1% versus like quarter. Service charges on deposits decreased $103 million mostly due to reduced incident rates. Card and payment related fees were affected by lower transaction volumes due to lower consumer spend. Wealth income decreased $43 million as market devaluation impacted wealth fees. Turning to Slide 12, noninterest expense increased $447 million, mostly due to $235 million loss and debt extinguishment, $102 million increase in merger and restructuring charges, and $55 million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Higher merger related expenses reflected professional services associated with integration and increased severance charges. We remain highly disciplined around core expenses. Excluding the abovementioned items, adjusted noninterest expense increased $55 million. This was mostly due to higher COVID related operating costs and performance-based incentives, partially offset by lower marketing and client development expense. We anticipate COVID-related operating expenses were decreased as we continue to take measures to protect teammates, clients and communities. We identified areas where cost savings can be accelerated including personnel expense, corporate real estate and third-party spend. We now believe we can accomplish 40% of the $1.6 billion in net cost saves by the fourth quarter this year, up from 30% we previously shared. Our FTEs declined 735. We expect further reductions throughout this year. We also closed 42 branches in non-overlapping markets. Turning to Slide 13, asset quality remains relatively stable, reflecting moderate deterioration in certain asset quality ratios and improvement in others. Our NPA and NPL ratios increased 2 and 3 basis points respectively to 25 and 35 basis points. Most of the NPL increased was in CRE, commercial construction and leasing portfolios. Net charge-offs increased 3 basis points to 39 basis points on average loans and leases. Our provision for credit losses totaled $844 million, reflecting stressed environment and the allowance build of $522 million. For the second quarter in a row, this allowance build was essentially self-funded by purchase accounting accretion. The allowance was 1.81% of loans and leases, up from 1.63%. Our coverage ratios remain strong at 4.49 times net charge-offs, and 5.24 times NPLs. A combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value mark is very robust at 2.76% of total loans. Our asset quality ratios were tempered by relief from the CARES Act. Our teammates have been very responsive to our clients, helping them navigate the pandemic. As of June 30, client accommodations totaled $13.8 billion in consumer loans, $21.2 billion in commercial loans, and $211 million in credit card balances. This represented an 11.2% increase in the loan portfolio. About 1/4 of the clients who received an accommodation continue to make payments on their loan. We expect third quarter asset quality metrics to deteriorate in response to COVID stress across the loan portfolios. Turning to Slide 14, as you can see on the table on the left, our exposure to vulnerable industries remains low and reflects diversification we achieved from the merger of equals. Outstanding loans to sensitive industries totaled $30.1 billion versus $28.4 billion. However, $1.1 billion was an increase due to PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, sensitive industry outstanding increased only $200 million or about 1%. Energy related balances were essentially flat, and our oil and gas portfolio continues to be weighted towards lower risk factors. Hotel, resort, and cruise line outstandings increased to 2.4% of loans held for investment from 2.1% last quarter. This reflects the inclusion of hotel REITs and real estate secured by hotels which were not previously included. Outstanding balances to restaurants increased modestly to 1% of loans held for investment from 0.8% at the end of March. Outstanding balances on leveraged loans totaled $9.5 billion, down 10% from last quarter. We are actively managing our sensitive industry portfolios. This includes deep segment reviews and reflecting credit adjustments in our risk rates. Turning to Slide 15. The allowance increase of $522 million to reflect the consideration of increased economic stress, the sensitivity to affected industries, and the proactive grading changes to reflect the current environment. The estimation process incorporates multiple economic scenarios, including assume likelihood of worsening conditions. Our assumptions include double-digit employment followed by sustained high-single-digit unemployment as we extended GDP recovery throughout 2-year forecast period. We also consider the effect of government relief packages and payment accommodations on expected losses, and made adjustments as needed to address model limitations. Taking into account the ACL amount of $6.1 billion and dividing it by the Truist, and 2 heritage companies net charge-offs for the past 12 months. We come up with a 5.7 times coverage ratio, which we believe is strong. Turning to Slide 16. Truist is very well positioned relative to peers in a strained credit environment. The table on the left utilizes DFAST 2020 results. This shows our estimated loan loss rate of 5.1% ranked third best among peers, and 60 basis points better than the peer average. We also have significant loss absorbing capacity of $9.2 billion due to the combination of the ACL and the unamortized loan marks. Our loss absorbing capacity represented 2.9% of end of period loans, and 60% of $15.3 billion 2020 DFAST stress losses. This slide shows how the merger of equals enhanced the risk profile of both companies and produced a resilient and more diversified balance sheet. Turning to Slide 13. Our capital ratios improved nicely across all ratios and remain strong. Reported CET1 ratio improved 9.7% from 9.3% in the first quarter. CET1 ratio benefited from current earnings, lower risk weighted assets and purchase accounting accretion. We issued $2.6 billion a preferred stock during the second quarter to further improve our capital position. Our second quarter dividend and payout ratios were 67%. The Truist Board will vote on a resolution to approve the third quarter common dividend of $0.45 at the July meeting. Turning to Slide 18. We continue to see strong liquidity and we are prepared to meet the funding needs of our clients through this challenging environment. Second quarter average LCR was 116% and a liquid asset buffer was 17.8%. Our access to secured funding sources remains robust with over $200 billion in cash, securities and secured borrowing capacity. Holding company cash is sufficient to cover 21 months of contractual and expected outflows with no inflows. Turning to Slide 19. We continue to be encouraged by the acceleration we\u2019ve seen across the digital platform. Digital commerce grew 11% during the year-to-date period through May. We also saw a 10% increase in the number of active mobile app users over the past year. Digital transactions also increased nicely. Mobile check deposits were up 23% from last May to this May. The acceleration in the digital has resulted in increased paperless adoption as statement suppressions are up 5%. One of the motivations of the merger was to combine technology with touch, to generate trust with our clients and to be able to meet their needs. That is why we are really pleased that the legacy BB&T mobile app, U, earned the number-one, J.D. Power ranking in the 2020 U.S. Banking Mobile App Satisfaction Study. In addition, LightStream legacy SunTrust national online lending division won the number-one ranking in J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study among personal loan lenders. These are great examples for the best of both capabilities as Truist advances its diverse digital and online capabilities. As it relates to guidance, we withdrew our 2020 annual guidance due to the uncertainty going forward. For the third quarter, we are providing limited guidance based on the third quarter linked quarter changes versus second quarter. We expect taxable equivalent revenue to be down 3% to 5% after excluding one-time security gains from the sale of non-agency MBS. Factors impacting revenue include a reduction in earning assets, mostly due to the line draw repayments, seasonally lower insurance income and lower residential mortgage spreads and servicing income. In addition, investment banking and trading faces a robust second quarter comp. We expect to report net interest margin to be flat and core net interest margin to increase modestly. Core noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and the amortization is expected to be down 1% to 3%. We also anticipate net charge-offs to be between 45 and 65 basis points. Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger, closing thoughts and Q&A.\nKelly King: Thanks, Daryl. So, if you follow along on Slide 20, I just want to mention a few things about how we\u2019re doing. The good news is our cultural development is fantastic. In fact, I would say that it is accelerating because of the challenges, because people are facing some extremely difficult challenges day-to-day. And that really kind of pulls the groups together. The sense of team-play in the organization today is phenomenal, far better than I could have ever hoped for. So, we feel great about how we\u2019re doing in terms of the organizations coming together. Had some really good recent developments, we branded Truist Insurance and Truist Foundation. We introduced Advisor Desktop to heritage BB&T Financial Advisors. And we were able to consolidate social media platform, leveraging Truist.com. Our conversions are in many cases right on schedule, for example, institutional broker dealer, mortgage origination and wealth are right on schedule for the second half of this year and the first half of next year. We did tell you last quarter and throughout the quarter that we were reassessing the core bank conversion, because of all of the challenging circumstances that we\u2019ve all faced. Those include, amongst others, a strategic reallocation of resources for the COVID response. When all of this hit, we had to focus on what was the most important at the moment. For example, we spent a lot of our IT and other support resources in the PPP program, and developing portals for our clients to do automatic deferrals, and developing automatic portals for automatic scheduling, so people could schedule appointments with our people remotely. We had work-from-home transitions for Truist and our offshore vendors, as we got all of the computers into everybody\u2019s homes. That just takes a little bit of time. And we did experience some critical vendor disruptions that hampered our conversion activities. So, we want to take all that into account. We want to make sure we do it right, do it well, that\u2019s most important. And so, we now anticipate the core bank conversion will be in the first half of 2022 versus the second half of 2021. It\u2019s not a dramatic change. But it is one we wanted to report out to you. And we think it\u2019s the best way to continue to provide the highest quality service for our clients. Still, we are committed to our $1.6 billion of net cost saves as Daryl described. And we\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019re able to pull forward expense savings around facilities, vendor spend, personnel cost, so that we now expect 40% of the $1.6 billion on an annualized basis to be available to us this year by the fourth quarter. And then we stay on track with 65% for the fourth quarter of 2021, and then the full 100% on fourth quarter 2022. So, it\u2019s just a little bit of pulling forward and 2020 versus a little bit less than 2021. So, we feel good about all of that, and think that will go very, very well. Wrapping up on Slide 21, just a couple of comments with regard to the value proposition we offer. You\u2019ve heard me say before and I still continue to believe this is a fantastic organization. The combination is excellent. It is fantastic for our shareholders. And the reason is this. It is an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. This is the 6th largest commercial Bank in the United States. We have strong market share in vibrant, fast-growing MSA markets. None of that has changed. We have a comprehensive business mix with distinctive capabilities in traditional banking, capital markets and insurance. And clearly, coming together, we\u2019ve already experienced what we thought would happen, which is that together, we get the best of breed, best talent, best technology, best strategy and best processes. And we really saw that this quarter with the strong performance in investment banking and insurance. One from SunTrust, one from BB&T came together beautifully, just like we thought it was. We have unique positioning to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns. We feel very strong about our cost saves as we said, and the projected efficiency ratios that we talked about. We feel very confident about medium-term targets of ROTCE in the low 20%s, adjusted efficiency in the low 50%s, common equity tier 1 ratio of 10%. We\u2019re closing in on that right now. So, this is going to be a best-in-class efficient, highly profitable organization. And largely, that\u2019s because we have strong capital and strong liquidity. And we have a very resilient risk profile, very strong, prudent, experienced risk management team, conservative risk culture, diversified benefits from the merger. We stress very well, which you just saw. And so, we have a very defensive balance sheet, which is insulated by purchase accounting marks combined with CECL credit reserves. So, all of that we knew would be true. We didn\u2019t know it would be tested as much as it is being in this environment, but it really is proven to be the kind of underlying or girding support that we need to be a very resilient organization in this environment. And this is a very challenging environment. I will say to you that as difficult as it is \u2013 as difficult as it is to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the future, I believe the economy is resilient. I believe ultimately, we will be okay. I believe the American people will do the right thing to create an equitable society with hope and opportunity for everyone. Everyone wins when we have an opportunity for everybody to have an equitable future. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working very, very hard to. Personally, I believe we will be a lot better off if we can get a lot more emphasis on love and caring for each other now to create a bright future for America and everyone in it. Let me turn it back now to Ryan.\nRyan Richards: Thank you, Kelly. Alan, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session?\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] All right, and we\u2019ll take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Hi, good morning.\nKelly King: Hey, good morning.\nDaryl Bible: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: Kelly, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expense side. You mentioned that you\u2019re pulling forward the cost saves over the next couple of quarters. And maybe you can remind us how far along on that $640 million you are already as of 2Q. And then, give us some sense in the discussions you had to accelerate that in 2020. What else you found that maybe you could add to the profitability opportunities here in 2021 as well? I know you kept the 65% flat. But knowing you, I\u2019m sure you unearthed a few other potential items of costs saves.\nKelly King: Yeah, Betsy, as you would expect, we\u2019re doing a deep dive in all of those areas to be sure that we can continue to provide high-performance profitability metrics, even as we orchestrate through this difficult environment. The pulling forward is just frankly getting more aggressive than we had even originally planned with regard to vendor renegotiations. We\u2019ve got a ton of buildings, as you might expect duplicative buildings, some small, some large. We\u2019ve got a major task-force working on that. And we decided to be very aggressive in terms of consolidating and eliminating a lot of those buildings. And that\u2019s pretty immediate cost reductions when you do that. We have a very aggressive personnel rationalization plan in process. And a good bit of that is already underway in 2Q as you alluded to. It will begin to flow down to the bottom line more in 3Q and 4Q as we get executing on that. The plans are well developed. And now, it\u2019s just a matter of executing on the plans. Now, keep in mind that while we\u2019re now calling this out, as we head into the remainder of this year and 2021, we also have some really good opportunities in terms of revenue. Our Integrated Relationship Management program is going extremely well. And we are redoubling our efforts with regard to that, because this is the time when our clients need us more than ever. And so, we are across the organization focusing on generating opportunities to help our clients and, of course, in the \u2013 so doing, we generate additional revenue for us. So we\u2019ve got all of these expense initiatives, but they\u2019re huge revenue initiatives as well, which gives us great confidence. We\u2019re focusing on the expense with you. From day one, we didn\u2019t add in revenue opportunities as a part of projecting. But I can just tell you that the development along the way in terms of realizing those revenue synergies is going far better than I would have ever expected, including all of the COVID difficulties related to that.\nDaryl Bible: The only thing I would add to that, Betsy, is that, in the first or second quarter, we had some COVID-related expenses. We talk about them, but we don\u2019t carve them out. We believe that those COVID expenses will moderate over the next quarter or so. So you\u2019ll be able to really see the cost saves as they moderated. But we\u2019re probably in the 15% to 20% range right now. And with the cost savings that Kelly said that we are actively working on, by fourth quarter, we\u2019ll have 40% of it we believe in fold.\nKelly King: Yeah. And also, I didn\u2019t mention too, Betsy, so we, in addition to those items Daryl mentioned, we had COVID-related reductions in income including money back on credit card purchases, the other types of incomes, NSF reductions, waivers, so were just so pretty big number. We haven\u2019t been trying to call that out, because I think most people are trying to kind of do the same thing. But it is material.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. So maybe you could just, as a follow up to the question, just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re anticipating the forbearance programs that you have in place. Stating from here, I just \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, are you going to be retaining people in forbearance until further notice? Do they roll off at a specific point in time? And maybe speak to both, the loan side as well as the fee waivers that you just mentioned?\nClarke Starnes: Yeah, Betsy, this is Clarke. I\u2019ll take the credit accommodations. I know Daryl and Kelly gave you the statistics there. I would tell you this we are seeing a substantially lower new incidence of client accommodation requests. I think much like others, the big wave was early on. And so, our focus now is actually on the expiration of the initial forbearance that we granted and whether they\u2019re going to need additional relief or not. So what we have been doing on both the wholesale and the consumer side, we\u2019ve marshaled substantial resources. But we\u2019re actually reaching out to these borrowers, whether they\u2019re individuals or whether they\u2019re businesses and trying to anticipate what they think their needs are, or what their current financial situation and outlook is, so that we can get a sense of what lies ahead. And I can just tell you, it depends on the individual situations we\u2019re seeing anywhere from 0% ask \u2013 think they\u2019ll need another accommodation to some asset classes. It might be 50%. So we\u2019re trying to take all that into consideration, be compliant with the CARES Act. But we\u2019re going to be much more thoughtful about the second wave to make sure that we\u2019re not kicking the can down the road. And so, as we\u2019re doing these reviews, we\u2019re also effectively, where it\u2019s appropriate, deferring the interest accrual. And Daryl talked about that. We\u2019re actually \u2013 got reserve there, if we think there\u2019s higher probability of re-default. And then, we\u2019re also, through this re-grading, that\u2019s definitely included in our modeling in our loan loss reserves.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, thanks. And on the fee waiver side, is that something that will sunset at some point?\nKelly King: Yes. So basically on the fee waivers, we think it\u2019s about time to kind of eliminate those. To be honest, we had lot of discussion about it. But we\u2019ve concluded that we got to let our clients ease back into normal life planning and financial planning. And so we\u2019ve terminated that.\nChristopher Henson: Yeah, Betsy, this is Chris. I would add, under Truist Cares, we did things like 5% cashback for grocery and pharmacy, ATM fees for waivers for clients and non-clients. We did for the EIP, a 30-day relief credit for those who did not have balances. And so, all those things to the point I think Kelly and Daryl making, we\u2019ll come back to is, we\u2019ve also had some service charge, bank card, check card challenges, which will come back, at least certainly a large portion of that will come back in 2021 as well.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So this should be over starting in 3Q into 4Q, and really full run rate by 1Q 2021 type of concept. Is that, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing.\nChristopher Henson: Okay. It\u2019s certainly up full run rate in 2020, yeah.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay.\nKelly King: Yeah.\nBetsy Graseck: All right. Thank you very much.\nKelly King: Thanks, Betsy.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nKelly King: Good morning.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. On the core NIM, I know, Daryl, you mentioned that the core NIM should be up modestly in the third quarter. Can you just discuss what the drivers of that would be and if you would expect similar moderate expansion quarterly thereafter on the core side? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah, so, John, we\u2019re doing several things around that. Obviously, you saw us exit $20 million of advances from the Home Loan Bank. They had rates north of 1%. We eliminated the negative carry that we had at the Fed at earning 10 basis points. So that was an immediate lift to run rate that\u2019s happening as we speak now. Kelly touched on earlier; we\u2019re continuingly have opportunity to continue to cut our core deposit rates. We think that will come down substantially over the next 2 quarters. So we feel good about that. If you look at on the commercial area, 75% of all new originations and modifications, got floors embedded into their loans. We think that will protect some of the yield from that perspective. And the other things we\u2019re looking at right now, it\u2019s kind of tricky on what assets you can grow, at this time that helps run rate and capital. But there are strategies like the Ginnie Mae buyout program, where we are adding to that. We\u2019re looking at maybe adding back our jumbo correspondent production that will add more earning assets there, 90% LTV, so you still have favorable risk weights, the student lending that\u2019s government guaranteed. So all those are capital friendly that help run rate will be positive. We\u2019re also looking at moving some of the mix out of the Fed balance into the investment portfolio to some extent. So all those I think will increase our core margin, which will help offset the slowdown as you have your reported margin. You have less fair value accounting coming through every quarter. We\u2019re trying to offset that with all these actions that we\u2019re taking so we can keep our margin flat.\nJohn Pancari: Okay, good. All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then, on the, I guess, I\u2019d say on the expense side, I mean, first, I know you indicated that you push back the core systems conversion. And you cited some vendor disruptions. Have you chosen a vendor for the core systems and will you be announcing that? And then, separately on the efficiency side, on the medium-term targets of the low 50%s, just want to see like, how much higher do rates need to be to make that a reality? And what type of timeframe, I guess? Thanks.\nKelly King: So, on the conversion we have a full plan developed. We have timelines developed. We have all the parties lined up in terms of executing. And as I said, we\u2019re executing literally as we speak in terms of non-core bank conversions. But for the core bank, all of that is lined up and moving forward. It\u2019s a big deal, so it\u2019s challenging. But we\u2019re very confident in terms of moving forward in the timeline we\u2019ve talked about. And Daryl can comment, but with regard to the efficiency ratio, you\u2019ve heard me say over the years. That\u2019s just a tough ratio, because you got a numerator and a denominator. But look we\u2019re at 55.8% in adjusted in this environment, without getting the benefits of the expense cuts from the conversion materially and the revenue enhancements. So that\u2019s why we feel very, very confident getting into low-50s from where we are today. The adjusted efficiency ratio will wash out to the normal efficiency ratio, because the \u2013 all the merger unusual costs now will go away. And so we feel very confident about that. So that \u2013 even if rates stay relatively low, I\u2019m optimistic we can get down to that kind of level. Obviously, if rates go up, then that really helps.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. I mean, the only thing I would add to that, John, is that, no matter what environment we\u2019re in, with putting the 2 companies together in the scale and efficiencies we have, we believe will be a top-tier provider in efficiency in any market condition that you have there. So rates are higher, it will have lower efficiency numbers. If rates stay lower, maybe they won\u2019t be quite as well as what we\u2019re saying, but we still should be in the top couple of our peer group from that perspective. So we feel very good about that.\nWilliam Rogers: And John, this is Bill. Maybe just \u2013 John, Bill. Just a little clarification maybe on the provider is the vendor disruptions that we\u2019ve had really are on the support and tech side. So our core providers that we\u2019ve selected for all the conversions that we\u2019ve talked about trust and brokerage and deposits, and all those, those are all in great shape, and we\u2019re proceeding well, and so that the challenge has really just been in the tech support.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Bill.\nWilliam Rogers: Okay.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.\nMichael Rose: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nKelly King: Good morning.\nMichael Rose: Just wanted to dig on some of the fee income businesses. Obviously, insurance was very strong. I think last quarter you got it about 3% year-on-year. Can you give some color there? And just maybe if you\u2019d expect any momentum to continue on the high banking trading side? Thanks.\nChristopher Henson: Sure. Happy to, Mike. This is Chris. Yeah, really excited about the quarter. It was a record quarter, as Kelly alluded to earlier. And the three drivers of organic growth was pricing and retention of new business. And so the \u2013 prior to COVID, they were all kind of hitting all cylinders, and what you have now as new businesses driven by GDP and uncertainty due to COVID tailing down a bit. But pricing is really robust. So what we had in the quarter was pricing last quarter was up in the 4.5% range closer to 5% this quarter. As anticipate, we\u2019ll continue to see acceleration for the remainder of this year and into 2021, I\u2019ll touch on why in just a minute. Client retention was, in retail, 90.3%, 84.1% in wholesale, also very strong, but what you\u2019re seeing there is a bit of a shift with the COVID uncertainties. You\u2019re beginning to see some of the standard carriers that support retail to really sort of pull back and refer to wholesale, which gets underwritten in the E&S market that supports the wholesale. So over a period of a year, you\u2019re seeing a little bit of \u2013 maybe a couple of percent down in retail, but up about 4% at wholesale. And that really underscores sort of the power of our diversified model, because we play in both channels. In fact, in wholesale, you might even get just to touch on margin in today\u2019s world, so that we actually benefit in that situation. New business production, where we were up maybe double digits last quarter, we\u2019re down 4%. But what I would say there is, while \u2013 and that\u2019s really driven by GDP, what\u2019s going on in the economy, uncertainty due to COVID. But I would tell you that overall outlook is much more positive, because of the price firming I just talked about. And we also saw in the quarter more stable exposure units than we\u2019d expect. We just did not see the business failures. It was just a limited number of business failures and also the growing excess and surplus lines volume, the shift from retail to wholesale that I had commented on just a minute. So in the quarter what all that gave us was organic growth in the 2.1% range. I think what I had said was sort of a flat to 2%, and we were right on the upper end of that range. So I felt very, very good about it in a market that I think some might would have expected flat to slightly down. Just another touch on pricing. You really are seeing upward momentum. I think we\u2019re going to continue to see all coverage types were up, except workers comp. All sizes were up at least in the sort of 4.5%, 5.5% range. You saw things like D&O up 9.3%, liability \u2013 professional liability up, 6%, 7%, business interruption up 6%. I mean, those are big numbers. So what we would expect in the third quarter, because of what Daryl had said earlier, was our \u2013 we\u2019re going out \u2013 we\u2019re coming out of the second quarter, which is our strongest quarter of the year to our weakest quarter of the year, the third quarter, which is purely seasonal. So you\u2019ll see something down in the 13%, 14% range. But for the year, we\u2019re still forecasting organic growth, what would be soft in third and fourth quarter. We\u2019re still seeing it in low-single-digits for the remainder of 2020 was really pricing sort of leading the way. So we feel really strong, really good about it.\nWilliam Rogers: This is Bill. I\u2019ll take the investment banking and trading side. We had a good quarter on investment banking. Things that we want to see, equity origination, investment grade were all really strong. I think, as Kelly noted, it really is highlighting the value of the franchise. And I felt really good about the relationships with commercial community bank and the pipelines that we\u2019re building and the dialogues that we\u2019re having with clients. All that being said, it\u2019s hard to predict quarter-to-quarter, just because there\u2019s just more volatility and there\u2019s some market dependency, but overall momentum in that business, I think it\u2019s just a real strength of the Truist merger. On the trading side, we just have a lower risk, client driven trading business that just has lower betas than these other businesses. So our core trading business was good in the areas of \u2013 that we wanted to be good in derivatives market trading again value the franchise, value of the relationships, taxable fixed income sales and trading. And the real difference was the CVA recognition was just much lower in this quarter that was last quarter and presuming the rate environment and credit environment that\u2019s stable that could continue. So just really good long-term momentum quarter-to-quarter, a little harder to predict.\nChristopher Henson: And Mike, it\u2019s Chris, again. I might just comment on mortgage. We had, as Kelly alluded to just an exceptional mortgage quarter this quarter. And Daryl said that we might expect it to tail down and touch I will tell you production, we think is going to be just as strong, maybe even a little stronger. It\u2019s just as the industry brings on more capacity, the margin is going to tail down to touch. So I mean, we\u2019re in a 319 kind of range this quarter, and that combines retail at 450 and correspondent a touch lower. But you\u2019re still going to probably have in the mid- to upper-2s, kind of margin. And you got additional servicing costs as Daryl pointed out, but still going to be a very strong year. I mean, the kind of year that would have been, frankly, I mean, kind of quarter, it would have been a year to the old BB&T. So very substantial kind of numbers overall.\nMichael Rose: Very, very helpful. Just one follow-up question. Exclude the items that you called out for noninterest expense on a core basis, it looks like expenses were $3.3 billion. Given the pull forward, some of the cost savings and mobile incentive comp, is it safe to assume that expenses would be down in the third quarter? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. So my prepared remarks, Mike, I said that we\u2019d be down 1% to 3% linked-quarter on excluding those items that I mentioned there. So we definitely believe it\u2019s going to have a [two or three] [ph] down third quarter and probably pretty good in the fourth quarter as well.\nMichael Rose: Sorry, I missed that. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from Dave Rochester with Compass Point.\nDavid Rochester: Hey, good morning, guys.\nKelly King: Good morning.\nDaryl Bible: Good morning.\nDavid Rochester: On your \u2013 just like on the margin, I appreciate your comments on the drivers going forward. I was just wondering what your assumptions were for the curve, the premium amortization there? And then on your opportunity to lower deposit costs, if you\u2019re assuming you can sort of hit that pre cycle low for the cost? Or if you\u2019re thinking you could actually take those even lower given all the liquidity you have, which would seem like a fairly reasonable assumption?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. So what I would tell you is, is that we\u2019re at 32 basis points right now. If you look that what our average in June was, we were at 25 basis points. So we will probably be in the low-20s maybe peers through 20% \u2013 or 20 basis points in the third quarter probably by fourth quarter will be in the teens. On heritage BB&T side, the lowest we got in the last crisis was 20 basis points. I don\u2019t have with me what heritage SunTrust was handy. But we\u2019re clearly headed lower. I think we\u2019re going to be lower than before. The assumptions on the margin outlook, we basically use the forward curve, forward curve basically has no rate movements for the next couple of years, a pretty flat curve. So we are not anticipating any increase. We\u2019re just trying to take actions that we think are prudent that we can take in the stressed environment to help improve core margin, which would help alleviate some of the offset of the fair value accounting accretion well.\nDavid Rochester: Any help on reduced securities premium and going forward? Or should that stay elevate?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah, we always tend to buy securities with 2% premium or less that\u2019s we\u2019ve done that for many, many years, because we don\u2019t like that to have a lot of leap year volatility. But you\u2019re seeing CPRs and the marketplace now of 30%, so they\u2019re prepaying pretty fast. If you look at our investment portfolio or in the mid- to high-$70 billion range, our cash flow is coming off are about $4.5 billion to $5 billion a quarter right now. So you\u2019re getting some of that amortization that we\u2019re seeing there. So we\u2019re reloading and trying to add to it. But it\u2019s hard to find security they don\u2019t have a big premium. So we\u2019re being as selective as we can from that perspective.\nDavid Rochester: Are you seeing other opportunities to move the needle with more FHLB paydowns?\nDaryl Bible: We are almost all out of Federal Home Loan Bank paydowns. I think we have $1 billion left or whatever that\u2019s going to roll off, I think, for later this year. So if we were to do anything right now, I\u2019m not saying we would, but the only thing left you can really do from a liability perspective is tender any outstanding debt. We have not made a decision to do any of that. But that\u2019s the only thing left. And then, as we aggressively push down deposit rates, we will be good to our clients. But non-clients, we\u2019re going to push them down really, really low. And if they leave, that\u2019s okay, because we have huge balances at the Fed.\nDavid Rochester: Great. And then maybe just one \u2013 switching to credit. You had some acceleration of pandemic in your markets. Did you guys make any overlays in your CECL process for that? And what that can mean for the reserving next quarter? If you see that accelerate? Are you already assuming that your base case that will get further acceleration?\nClarke Starnes: Hey, Dave, this is Clarke. We did consider that and as we\u2019ve gone through, I mentioned these deep dive reviews by segments that would include geographies as well, and even things like individual property levels and submarkets. So we have considered that and tried to take that into consideration in our estimates, which obviously did assume further deterioration.\nDavid Rochester: Great. And then just maybe as a last follow-up to that. What are you guys hearing for business customers on the ground on how they\u2019re feeling about the pandemic in the background? And is there any outsize caution there? Does it mean more deposit growth and less loan growth going forward? Just any thoughts there would be great.\nDaryl Bible: So from what we\u2019re hearing from clients, I would say, a pandemic-wise. Our clients \u2013 for the most part, our small business clients are probably the ones most impacted right now, because they don\u2019t have the same reserves that larger companies do. So larger companies depending on what scenarios you\u2019re in, some are under stress, some are actually doing really well. It\u2019s a really broad spectrum there from that perspective. From a cards perspective and the team, they\u2019ve been actively grading down the more stress credit. So you\u2019re seeing that reflected, and that\u2019s showing up in our allowance numbers on that. But from a deposit, we have huge deposit growth. The DDA growth that we got, the $20 billion that Kelly mentioned 80% of that was coming from businesses that will probably moderate over time. And if you look at the growth that we\u2019ve gotten from our interest checking and MMDA, most of that is coming from personal. I think that will also get spent and moderate over time. It all depends on the government comes out with more stimulus checks, then that might add back to the balances there.\nKelly King: Yeah. One of the interesting things that we\u2019re finding, but I must admit I was a little bit positively surprised about is the resiliency of our clients, when we talked to our regional presidents and our people that are dealing direct with clients. In many, many cases, they\u2019re saying, well, the clients feel pretty good given the environment and the reason is because they learned their lesson 10 years ago in the Great Recession. And when this hit, they acted fast. They held their expenses. They tried to be creative in terms of generating other revenues. And they\u2019re hanging on much, much better than I might have expected. Now they\u2019re \u2013 some of the tiniest, micros all businesses are having the hardest time because they don\u2019t any rainy-day funds. They live kind of day to day. But for most of our small business clients, they have some resiliency, but mostly they responded very fast. So now if it hangs on a long time, it\u2019s just going to be hard. But if this recovers reasonably quickly, I think we may be pleasantly surprised at how well our business community actually [recovers] [ph].\nChristopher Henson: And this is Chris, Kelly. Just to reinforce your point over half of our 24 regions are actually on goal for lending business to date. And what\u2019s really good to see is to the top regions or like West Virginia and Virginia West, some of our core \u2013 corest of core regions. And so I absolutely agree with what you\u2019re saying.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nAmanda Larsen: Hey, guys. This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. You mentioned that the COVID-19 related deferred interest reducing NIM by 5 basis points? Was that just accounting? Or was that a choice that you guys made for prudence to not accrue interest on customers that are experiencing duress?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. So just based on our prior experience, Amanda in the last crisis, we know that some of the people that are on payment deferral are going to end up in charge-off. And we don\u2019t want to have any surprises. So we\u2019re using a lot of metrics depending portfolio specific on which percentages people will carry through and might not be able to make their payments, and it varies by each portfolio. But this quarter was around $50 million for us. And that\u2019s what we backed out of our net interest income from accrual basis. So we did a little bit in the first quarter, and we\u2019re continuing to manage and monitor that, but we think it\u2019s prudent accounting just to basically make sure that we are going to accrue what we think we\u2019re going get paid back on.\nAmanda Larsen: Okay, great. And then separate question, can you provide updated thoughts on the capital stack, you guys issued $2.5 billion of preferred, bringing your preferred-to-ROAs up to like 185%. Do you expect to continue to run with this bucket kind of oversized relative to 1.5% sort of optimization level? Like what\u2019s your thought process here? And how does it tie in with the strategy of the overall funding base?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. So Amanda, we\u2019re just taking it day by day and as we know certain things. So right now, we\u2019re still in a stressed period. So we\u2019re going to keep our capital stack pretty strong. We do have the ability to call some of the preferred out over the next year or two, if things were to lighten up. That would be about $1.5 billion or so. But right now, I think we want to keep our capital really strong. We continue to evaluate and make sure that we have enough. We\u2019re managing the capital for stress and what could come our way from that perspective. But we have a lot of flexibility. And we will make prudent decisions, and we\u2019ll let you know when we make those decisions right now. But right now, we\u2019re happy with the capital that we have.\nAmanda Larsen: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah.\nOperator: All right. Next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. Just one follow-up question, if I may. As you think about $5.7 billion in terms of your loan loss reserve, are \u2013 is the majority \u2013 is reserve building behind you?\nClarke Starnes: Erika, this is Clarke. Obviously, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this from others, we follow our process, we look at our models, our economic scenario assumptions, our client behaviors, and the deep dives around these specific industries, and we do everything we can in the CECL process to estimate what we think those lifetime losses are. So obviously, if those scenarios play out differently, our clients perform differently than we had forecasted, then that would adjust what we would need to do in the future. So for now, we think we\u2019ve done the very best estimate we can with the information that we\u2019ve been able to evaluate\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Next question will be from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Kelly, and good morning, Daryl.\nDaryl Bible: Good morning.\nKelly King: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Clarke, can you share with us? When you look at the portfolio today, and I know this is going to take some guesswork, but 18 months from now when we\u2019re finally through this crisis, do you think the greater credit losses may show up in the consumer side of the house or the commercial side? And when I think of commercial, where in the commercial side of the house are you seeing greater stress? Is it commercial real estate?\nClarke Starnes: It\u2019s a great question, Gerard, and we debate that every day. Certainly, for us right now, while we\u2019re concerned about the consumer, we\u2019re watching it very closely with all the stimulus support and the savings and different things. It\u2019s holding up relatively well, even if you take out the forbearance benefit that we\u2019ve provided. I think our concern right now is more in the commercial side. If you look at our reserve allocation, to even again for this quarter, it was 80% plus on the wholesale side. So I think that\u2019s what \u2013 we\u2019re looking at things like, what does \u2013 how does the hospitality or some of these sensitive areas; are there structural changes in office or other property types? So I think the wholesale side, based on various certain industry segments and CRE types are where we\u2019re putting most of our focus right now.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Daryl, when we looked at the DFAST results, it seemed like your results weren\u2019t as strong as they should have been in PPNR and even some of the credit losses. Is there any way of addressing that with the Fed or you just really have to just take what they give you and just work your way through it?\nDaryl Bible: Gerard, we did do a press release earlier that week, when \u2013 after the numbers came out on Thursday. We said that we thought potentially that our numbers on provision, we thought should have been a little bit lower. It\u2019s hard to know, when you\u2019re doing current method, you have to really know when the loans come off first, and when they stay on the books, and to know when it has to get reloaded with the new originations. And you don\u2019t have that data; I think it\u2019s hard to actually forecast that. I think in their model, methodology, they say they try to account for it, but you really need to have good instruments in forecasting, to know what loans are coming on and off. Then on fair value accounting, if you have PPNR models that are based upon historical results, this was probably the worst time you could model PPNR, because the company just came together in December. We had maybe three weeks of purchase accounting, so you really didn\u2019t have anything. You did have one year of noninterest expense. And that appropriately got loaded into our run rate. And we\u2019re going to have that for the next year or two, and that will fade away. But fair value accounting is real, it\u2019s alive. I mean, we had over almost $1 billion in the first twp quarters of this year that we basically were able to use that from an earnings perspective. And we kind of think of it that it kind of helped fund our allowance though. It wasn\u2019t exact, but it was like 90%-plus what the amount was. It just happened that way, but didn\u2019t really have any earnings impact off of our core earnings because of that. So we feel over time that our history will be loaded with fair value accounting. And that will get done appropriately. We are actively meeting with the Fed. They\u2019re here, as you know, constantly and we\u2019re giving them all the information, sharing everything that we have. And we hope down the road that we will get better results. And we still think long term, our MOE, we should be top-tier performing, not just on the loss rate, but also on the PPNR and on the capital resiliency. It might take two or three years to get the expenses out of our run rate. But hopefully, by year three from now, we\u2019re going to be in the top quartile or, if not, the best in our peer group.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: All right, next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\nBrian Klock: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.\nDaryl Bible: Good morning.\nKelly King: Good morning.\nBrian Klock: Hey, and then thanks for going over the hour and then taking my question. Just a real quick credit follow-up for Clarke, I guess, can you talk about the reserve build for the second quarter? And kind of how much of that could be related to either the downgrades that you mentioned earlier? And then, maybe you can talk about the change in criticized assets quarter-over-quarter too, please.\nClarke Starnes: It\u2019s a great question. You\u2019ll see our C&C asse4ts when we file the Q. But I mentioned this deep-dive and re-grading process we went through. So effectively on the wholesale side, we\u2019ve actually in the sensitive industry areas, we\u2019ve done deep dives. As an example, in the hospitality area, we covered 90% of our total exposure there on a borrower-by-borrower basis and re-enter every one of those. And done that similar process for the other sensitive industries and then for any client this had an accommodation. And so, we\u2019ve marshaled a ton of people to do that. And so we\u2019re getting real-time information. That has certainly impacted our grading. And so, we proactively downgraded a good number of credits. The biggest stress we\u2019ve seen in the downgrades has been in hospitality and things like CRE and retail. So, all of that is baked into our second quarter estimate. And as I mentioned, about 80% plus of the additional increase is related to those, the wholesale and particularly to those sensitive industry areas.\nBrian Klock: That\u2019s great color. Thanks for your time, guys.\nClarke Starnes: Thanks.\nOperator: All right. We\u2019ll next go to Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac: Thanks. Just a quick one for Darryl on the PPP forgiveness, is that something that you can kind of have a certainty about in terms of how it might impact year-end and first part of next year?\nDaryl Bible: I can tell you our assumptions, Chris. This is, obviously, a new product, and we\u2019ll see how it all plays out. But if you look at the fees, obviously, we set them up on the loan system. And they get amortized to go over a two-year time period. But as they get the forgiveness and then get paid back, all that left accretion to that loan would actually come into earnings in that time period. So our assumptions are that, we believe 75% of our production in PPP will get forgiveness. We believe that, this is the timing that we put in our models. In the fourth quarter, 30% of the 75% will get forgiven, 65% of the 70% will get forgiven in the first quarter of 2021, and then the remaining 5% of the 75% in quarter two of 2021. The other 25%, we think will go all the way to term and from that perspective. That\u2019s our estimate. It\u2019s our best guess, they did modify it. So we pushed out a little bit. PPP is very fluid. It tends to change a lot. So we\u2019ll see how things would react. But this is our best estimate right now.\nChristopher Marinac: Got it. And that will impact the margin when it happens. But I imagine you break that out. So would this be a onetime event in each of those quarters?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah, we\u2019ll mention it. I mean, it\u2019s in our run rate now a little bit, because you\u2019re still amortizing, basically, the fee over that two-year time period. So like for this quarter, it was worth about $49 million of our net interest income for the second quarter.\nChristopher Marinac: Okay, great. Well, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much, guys.\nDaryl Bible: Thank you. You have a great day.\nOperator: And at this time, it looks like we have no further time for questions. So I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Ryan for any additional or closing remarks.\nRyan Richards: Thank you, Alan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I apologize to those with questions we didn\u2019t have time to get to. We will certainly reach out to you later today. And we wish you all the best. Goodbye.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "William Rogers",
            "content": "And John, this is Bill. Maybe just \u2013 John, Bill. Just a little clarification maybe on the provider is the vendor disruptions that we've had really are on the support and tech side. So our core providers that we've selected for all the conversions that we've talked about trust and brokerage and deposits, and all those, those are all in great shape, and we're proceeding well, and so that the challenge has really just been in the tech support. Okay. This is Bill. I'll take the investment banking and trading side. We had a good quarter on investment banking. Things that we want to see, equity origination, investment grade were all really strong. I think, as Kelly noted, it really is highlighting the value of the franchise. And I felt really good about the relationships with commercial community bank and the pipelines that we're building and the dialogues that we're having with clients. All that being said, it's hard to predict quarter-to-quarter, just because there's just more volatility and there's some market dependency, but overall momentum in that business, I think it's just a real strength of the Truist merger. On the trading side, we just have a lower risk, client driven trading business that just has lower betas than these other businesses. So our core trading business was good in the areas of \u2013 that we wanted to be good in derivatives market trading again value the franchise, value of the relationships, taxable fixed income sales and trading. And the real difference was the CVA recognition was just much lower in this quarter that was last quarter and presuming the rate environment and credit environment that's stable that could continue. So just really good long-term momentum quarter-to-quarter, a little harder to predict."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to cover key points from the second quarter, discuss current business conditions and provide an update on cost saves. Turning to Slide 10, net interest margin was 3.13%, down 45 basis points. Purchase accounting contributed 46 basis points to reported net interest margin versus 52 basis points last quarter. Core net interest margin was 2.67%, down 39 basis points impacted by lower benchmark interest rates, higher Fed balances, and COVID-related deferred interest. The yield on loans and leases held for investment decreased 81 basis points due to lower interest rates, lower purchase accounting accretion and deferred interest and loans with forbearance. The yield on the securities portfolio decreased 25 basis points primarily due to higher premium amortization. Asset sensitivity moderated as a result of higher fixed rate assets, lower fixed rate federal home loan bank advances and lower benchmark interest rates, mitigating down rate scenarios. We're projecting loan yields \u2013 well, we're protecting loan yields with rate floors on new commercial obligations and modifications, and we'll continue to manage down deposit costs. We expect to report net interest margin to be flat for the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 11, Noninterest income includes $300 million in security gains related to the sale of non-agency MBS, excluding these gains, core noninterest income was up $160 million. Investment banking and trading income increased $156 million on strong core trading activity and elevated counterparty reserves in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage income was up $96 million on strong volumes and improved margins, partially offset by lower servicing due to higher prepayments. Refi was 65% of originations and gain on sale was 319 basis points reflecting very favorable conditions in mortgage. Insurance income increased $32 million, up 5.8% to record levels, primarily due to seasonality and pricing. Organic revenue grew 2.1% versus like quarter. Service charges on deposits decreased $103 million mostly due to reduced incident rates. Card and payment related fees were affected by lower transaction volumes due to lower consumer spend. Wealth income decreased $43 million as market devaluation impacted wealth fees. Turning to Slide 12, noninterest expense increased $447 million, mostly due to $235 million loss and debt extinguishment, $102 million increase in merger and restructuring charges, and $55 million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Higher merger related expenses reflected professional services associated with integration and increased severance charges. We remain highly disciplined around core expenses. Excluding the abovementioned items, adjusted noninterest expense increased $55 million. This was mostly due to higher COVID related operating costs and performance-based incentives, partially offset by lower marketing and client development expense. We anticipate COVID-related operating expenses were decreased as we continue to take measures to protect teammates, clients and communities. We identified areas where cost savings can be accelerated including personnel expense, corporate real estate and third-party spend. We now believe we can accomplish 40% of the $1.6 billion in net cost saves by the fourth quarter this year, up from 30% we previously shared. Our FTEs declined 735. We expect further reductions throughout this year. We also closed 42 branches in non-overlapping markets. Turning to Slide 13, asset quality remains relatively stable, reflecting moderate deterioration in certain asset quality ratios and improvement in others. Our NPA and NPL ratios increased 2 and 3 basis points respectively to 25 and 35 basis points. Most of the NPL increased was in CRE, commercial construction and leasing portfolios. Net charge-offs increased 3 basis points to 39 basis points on average loans and leases. Our provision for credit losses totaled $844 million, reflecting stressed environment and the allowance build of $522 million. For the second quarter in a row, this allowance build was essentially self-funded by purchase accounting accretion. The allowance was 1.81% of loans and leases, up from 1.63%. Our coverage ratios remain strong at 4.49 times net charge-offs, and 5.24 times NPLs. A combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value mark is very robust at 2.76% of total loans. Our asset quality ratios were tempered by relief from the CARES Act. Our teammates have been very responsive to our clients, helping them navigate the pandemic. As of June 30, client accommodations totaled $13.8 billion in consumer loans, $21.2 billion in commercial loans, and $211 million in credit card balances. This represented an 11.2% increase in the loan portfolio. About 1/4 of the clients who received an accommodation continue to make payments on their loan. We expect third quarter asset quality metrics to deteriorate in response to COVID stress across the loan portfolios. Turning to Slide 14, as you can see on the table on the left, our exposure to vulnerable industries remains low and reflects diversification we achieved from the merger of equals. Outstanding loans to sensitive industries totaled $30.1 billion versus $28.4 billion. However, $1.1 billion was an increase due to PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, sensitive industry outstanding increased only $200 million or about 1%. Energy related balances were essentially flat, and our oil and gas portfolio continues to be weighted towards lower risk factors. Hotel, resort, and cruise line outstandings increased to 2.4% of loans held for investment from 2.1% last quarter. This reflects the inclusion of hotel REITs and real estate secured by hotels which were not previously included. Outstanding balances to restaurants increased modestly to 1% of loans held for investment from 0.8% at the end of March. Outstanding balances on leveraged loans totaled $9.5 billion, down 10% from last quarter. We are actively managing our sensitive industry portfolios. This includes deep segment reviews and reflecting credit adjustments in our risk rates. Turning to Slide 15. The allowance increase of $522 million to reflect the consideration of increased economic stress, the sensitivity to affected industries, and the proactive grading changes to reflect the current environment. The estimation process incorporates multiple economic scenarios, including assume likelihood of worsening conditions. Our assumptions include double-digit employment followed by sustained high-single-digit unemployment as we extended GDP recovery throughout 2-year forecast period. We also consider the effect of government relief packages and payment accommodations on expected losses, and made adjustments as needed to address model limitations. Taking into account the ACL amount of $6.1 billion and dividing it by the Truist, and 2 heritage companies net charge-offs for the past 12 months. We come up with a 5.7 times coverage ratio, which we believe is strong. Turning to Slide 16. Truist is very well positioned relative to peers in a strained credit environment. The table on the left utilizes DFAST 2020 results. This shows our estimated loan loss rate of 5.1% ranked third best among peers, and 60 basis points better than the peer average. We also have significant loss absorbing capacity of $9.2 billion due to the combination of the ACL and the unamortized loan marks. Our loss absorbing capacity represented 2.9% of end of period loans, and 60% of $15.3 billion 2020 DFAST stress losses. This slide shows how the merger of equals enhanced the risk profile of both companies and produced a resilient and more diversified balance sheet. Turning to Slide 13. Our capital ratios improved nicely across all ratios and remain strong. Reported CET1 ratio improved 9.7% from 9.3% in the first quarter. CET1 ratio benefited from current earnings, lower risk weighted assets and purchase accounting accretion. We issued $2.6 billion a preferred stock during the second quarter to further improve our capital position. Our second quarter dividend and payout ratios were 67%. The Truist Board will vote on a resolution to approve the third quarter common dividend of $0.45 at the July meeting. Turning to Slide 18. We continue to see strong liquidity and we are prepared to meet the funding needs of our clients through this challenging environment. Second quarter average LCR was 116% and a liquid asset buffer was 17.8%. Our access to secured funding sources remains robust with over $200 billion in cash, securities and secured borrowing capacity. Holding company cash is sufficient to cover 21 months of contractual and expected outflows with no inflows. Turning to Slide 19. We continue to be encouraged by the acceleration we've seen across the digital platform. Digital commerce grew 11% during the year-to-date period through May. We also saw a 10% increase in the number of active mobile app users over the past year. Digital transactions also increased nicely. Mobile check deposits were up 23% from last May to this May. The acceleration in the digital has resulted in increased paperless adoption as statement suppressions are up 5%. One of the motivations of the merger was to combine technology with touch, to generate trust with our clients and to be able to meet their needs. That is why we are really pleased that the legacy BB&T mobile app, U, earned the number-one, J.D. Power ranking in the 2020 U.S. Banking Mobile App Satisfaction Study. In addition, LightStream legacy SunTrust national online lending division won the number-one ranking in J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study among personal loan lenders. These are great examples for the best of both capabilities as Truist advances its diverse digital and online capabilities. As it relates to guidance, we withdrew our 2020 annual guidance due to the uncertainty going forward. For the third quarter, we are providing limited guidance based on the third quarter linked quarter changes versus second quarter. We expect taxable equivalent revenue to be down 3% to 5% after excluding one-time security gains from the sale of non-agency MBS. Factors impacting revenue include a reduction in earning assets, mostly due to the line draw repayments, seasonally lower insurance income and lower residential mortgage spreads and servicing income. In addition, investment banking and trading faces a robust second quarter comp. We expect to report net interest margin to be flat and core net interest margin to increase modestly. Core noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and the amortization is expected to be down 1% to 3%. We also anticipate net charge-offs to be between 45 and 65 basis points. Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger, closing thoughts and Q&A. Good morning. The only thing I would add to that, Betsy, is that, in the first or second quarter, we had some COVID-related expenses. We talk about them, but we don't carve them out. We believe that those COVID expenses will moderate over the next quarter or so. So you'll be able to really see the cost saves as they moderated. But we're probably in the 15% to 20% range right now. And with the cost savings that Kelly said that we are actively working on, by fourth quarter, we'll have 40% of it we believe in fold. Yeah, so, John, we're doing several things around that. Obviously, you saw us exit $20 million of advances from the Home Loan Bank. They had rates north of 1%. We eliminated the negative carry that we had at the Fed at earning 10 basis points. So that was an immediate lift to run rate that's happening as we speak now. Kelly touched on earlier; we're continuingly have opportunity to continue to cut our core deposit rates. We think that will come down substantially over the next 2 quarters. So we feel good about that. If you look at on the commercial area, 75% of all new originations and modifications, got floors embedded into their loans. We think that will protect some of the yield from that perspective. And the other things we're looking at right now, it's kind of tricky on what assets you can grow, at this time that helps run rate and capital. But there are strategies like the Ginnie Mae buyout program, where we are adding to that. We're looking at maybe adding back our jumbo correspondent production that will add more earning assets there, 90% LTV, so you still have favorable risk weights, the student lending that's government guaranteed. So all those are capital friendly that help run rate will be positive. We're also looking at moving some of the mix out of the Fed balance into the investment portfolio to some extent. So all those I think will increase our core margin, which will help offset the slowdown as you have your reported margin. You have less fair value accounting coming through every quarter. We're trying to offset that with all these actions that we're taking so we can keep our margin flat. Yeah. I mean, the only thing I would add to that, John, is that, no matter what environment we're in, with putting the 2 companies together in the scale and efficiencies we have, we believe will be a top-tier provider in efficiency in any market condition that you have there. So rates are higher, it will have lower efficiency numbers. If rates stay lower, maybe they won't be quite as well as what we're saying, but we still should be in the top couple of our peer group from that perspective. So we feel very good about that. Yeah. So my prepared remarks, Mike, I said that we'd be down 1% to 3% linked-quarter on excluding those items that I mentioned there. So we definitely believe it's going to have a [two or three] [ph] down third quarter and probably pretty good in the fourth quarter as well. Good morning. Yeah. So what I would tell you is, is that we're at 32 basis points right now. If you look that what our average in June was, we were at 25 basis points. So we will probably be in the low-20s maybe peers through 20% \u2013 or 20 basis points in the third quarter probably by fourth quarter will be in the teens. On heritage BB&T side, the lowest we got in the last crisis was 20 basis points. I don't have with me what heritage SunTrust was handy. But we're clearly headed lower. I think we're going to be lower than before. The assumptions on the margin outlook, we basically use the forward curve, forward curve basically has no rate movements for the next couple of years, a pretty flat curve. So we are not anticipating any increase. We're just trying to take actions that we think are prudent that we can take in the stressed environment to help improve core margin, which would help alleviate some of the offset of the fair value accounting accretion well. Yeah, we always tend to buy securities with 2% premium or less that's we've done that for many, many years, because we don't like that to have a lot of leap year volatility. But you're seeing CPRs and the marketplace now of 30%, so they're prepaying pretty fast. If you look at our investment portfolio or in the mid- to high-$70 billion range, our cash flow is coming off are about $4.5 billion to $5 billion a quarter right now. So you're getting some of that amortization that we're seeing there. So we're reloading and trying to add to it. But it's hard to find security they don't have a big premium. So we're being as selective as we can from that perspective. We are almost all out of Federal Home Loan Bank paydowns. I think we have $1 billion left or whatever that's going to roll off, I think, for later this year. So if we were to do anything right now, I'm not saying we would, but the only thing left you can really do from a liability perspective is tender any outstanding debt. We have not made a decision to do any of that. But that's the only thing left. And then, as we aggressively push down deposit rates, we will be good to our clients. But non-clients, we're going to push them down really, really low. And if they leave, that's okay, because we have huge balances at the Fed. So from what we're hearing from clients, I would say, a pandemic-wise. Our clients \u2013 for the most part, our small business clients are probably the ones most impacted right now, because they don't have the same reserves that larger companies do. So larger companies depending on what scenarios you're in, some are under stress, some are actually doing really well. It's a really broad spectrum there from that perspective. From a cards perspective and the team, they've been actively grading down the more stress credit. So you're seeing that reflected, and that's showing up in our allowance numbers on that. But from a deposit, we have huge deposit growth. The DDA growth that we got, the $20 billion that Kelly mentioned 80% of that was coming from businesses that will probably moderate over time. And if you look at the growth that we've gotten from our interest checking and MMDA, most of that is coming from personal. I think that will also get spent and moderate over time. It all depends on the government comes out with more stimulus checks, then that might add back to the balances there. Yeah. So just based on our prior experience, Amanda in the last crisis, we know that some of the people that are on payment deferral are going to end up in charge-off. And we don't want to have any surprises. So we're using a lot of metrics depending portfolio specific on which percentages people will carry through and might not be able to make their payments, and it varies by each portfolio. But this quarter was around $50 million for us. And that's what we backed out of our net interest income from accrual basis. So we did a little bit in the first quarter, and we're continuing to manage and monitor that, but we think it's prudent accounting just to basically make sure that we are going to accrue what we think we're going get paid back on. Yeah. So Amanda, we're just taking it day by day and as we know certain things. So right now, we're still in a stressed period. So we're going to keep our capital stack pretty strong. We do have the ability to call some of the preferred out over the next year or two, if things were to lighten up. That would be about $1.5 billion or so. But right now, I think we want to keep our capital really strong. We continue to evaluate and make sure that we have enough. We're managing the capital for stress and what could come our way from that perspective. But we have a lot of flexibility. And we will make prudent decisions, and we'll let you know when we make those decisions right now. But right now, we're happy with the capital that we have. Yeah. Good morning. Gerard, we did do a press release earlier that week, when \u2013 after the numbers came out on Thursday. We said that we thought potentially that our numbers on provision, we thought should have been a little bit lower. It's hard to know, when you're doing current method, you have to really know when the loans come off first, and when they stay on the books, and to know when it has to get reloaded with the new originations. And you don't have that data; I think it's hard to actually forecast that. I think in their model, methodology, they say they try to account for it, but you really need to have good instruments in forecasting, to know what loans are coming on and off. Then on fair value accounting, if you have PPNR models that are based upon historical results, this was probably the worst time you could model PPNR, because the company just came together in December. We had maybe three weeks of purchase accounting, so you really didn't have anything. You did have one year of noninterest expense. And that appropriately got loaded into our run rate. And we're going to have that for the next year or two, and that will fade away. But fair value accounting is real, it's alive. I mean, we had over almost $1 billion in the first twp quarters of this year that we basically were able to use that from an earnings perspective. And we kind of think of it that it kind of helped fund our allowance though. It wasn't exact, but it was like 90%-plus what the amount was. It just happened that way, but didn't really have any earnings impact off of our core earnings because of that. So we feel over time that our history will be loaded with fair value accounting. And that will get done appropriately. We are actively meeting with the Fed. They're here, as you know, constantly and we're giving them all the information, sharing everything that we have. And we hope down the road that we will get better results. And we still think long term, our MOE, we should be top-tier performing, not just on the loss rate, but also on the PPNR and on the capital resiliency. It might take two or three years to get the expenses out of our run rate. But hopefully, by year three from now, we're going to be in the top quartile or, if not, the best in our peer group. Good morning. I can tell you our assumptions, Chris. This is, obviously, a new product, and we'll see how it all plays out. But if you look at the fees, obviously, we set them up on the loan system. And they get amortized to go over a two-year time period. But as they get the forgiveness and then get paid back, all that left accretion to that loan would actually come into earnings in that time period. So our assumptions are that, we believe 75% of our production in PPP will get forgiveness. We believe that, this is the timing that we put in our models. In the fourth quarter, 30% of the 75% will get forgiven, 65% of the 70% will get forgiven in the first quarter of 2021, and then the remaining 5% of the 75% in quarter two of 2021. The other 25%, we think will go all the way to term and from that perspective. That's our estimate. It's our best guess, they did modify it. So we pushed out a little bit. PPP is very fluid. It tends to change a lot. So we'll see how things would react. But this is our best estimate right now. Yeah, we'll mention it. I mean, it's in our run rate now a little bit, because you're still amortizing, basically, the fee over that two-year time period. So like for this quarter, it was worth about $49 million of our net interest income for the second quarter. Thank you. You have a great day."

            "name": "Clarke Starnes",
            "content": "Yeah, Betsy, this is Clarke. I'll take the credit accommodations. I know Daryl and Kelly gave you the statistics there. I would tell you this we are seeing a substantially lower new incidence of client accommodation requests. I think much like others, the big wave was early on. And so, our focus now is actually on the expiration of the initial forbearance that we granted and whether they're going to need additional relief or not. So what we have been doing on both the wholesale and the consumer side, we've marshaled substantial resources. But we're actually reaching out to these borrowers, whether they're individuals or whether they're businesses and trying to anticipate what they think their needs are, or what their current financial situation and outlook is, so that we can get a sense of what lies ahead. And I can just tell you, it depends on the individual situations we're seeing anywhere from 0% ask \u2013 think they'll need another accommodation to some asset classes. It might be 50%. So we're trying to take all that into consideration, be compliant with the CARES Act. But we're going to be much more thoughtful about the second wave to make sure that we're not kicking the can down the road. And so, as we're doing these reviews, we're also effectively, where it's appropriate, deferring the interest accrual. And Daryl talked about that. We're actually \u2013 got reserve there, if we think there's higher probability of re-default. And then, we're also, through this re-grading, that's definitely included in our modeling in our loan loss reserves. Hey, Dave, this is Clarke. We did consider that and as we've gone through, I mentioned these deep dive reviews by segments that would include geographies as well, and even things like individual property levels and submarkets. So we have considered that and tried to take that into consideration in our estimates, which obviously did assume further deterioration. Erika, this is Clarke. Obviously, I'm sure you've heard this from others, we follow our process, we look at our models, our economic scenario assumptions, our client behaviors, and the deep dives around these specific industries, and we do everything we can in the CECL process to estimate what we think those lifetime losses are. So obviously, if those scenarios play out differently, our clients perform differently than we had forecasted, then that would adjust what we would need to do in the future. So for now, we think we've done the very best estimate we can with the information that we've been able to evaluate It's a great question, Gerard, and we debate that every day. Certainly, for us right now, while we're concerned about the consumer, we're watching it very closely with all the stimulus support and the savings and different things. It's holding up relatively well, even if you take out the forbearance benefit that we've provided. I think our concern right now is more in the commercial side. If you look at our reserve allocation, to even again for this quarter, it was 80% plus on the wholesale side. So I think that's what \u2013 we're looking at things like, what does \u2013 how does the hospitality or some of these sensitive areas; are there structural changes in office or other property types? So I think the wholesale side, based on various certain industry segments and CRE types are where we're putting most of our focus right now. It's a great question. You'll see our C&C asse4ts when we file the Q. But I mentioned this deep-dive and re-grading process we went through. So effectively on the wholesale side, we've actually in the sensitive industry areas, we've done deep dives. As an example, in the hospitality area, we covered 90% of our total exposure there on a borrower-by-borrower basis and re-enter every one of those. And done that similar process for the other sensitive industries and then for any client this had an accommodation. And so, we've marshaled a ton of people to do that. And so we're getting real-time information. That has certainly impacted our grading. And so, we proactively downgraded a good number of credits. The biggest stress we've seen in the downgrades has been in hospitality and things like CRE and retail. So, all of that is baked into our second quarter estimate. And as I mentioned, about 80% plus of the additional increase is related to those, the wholesale and particularly to those sensitive industry areas. Thanks."

            "name": "Kelly King",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call, and I hope you and your family are safe and well. Given the challenges that we face, I think this was a really strong quarter, primarily because we lived our purpose. And I will say I am really, really proud of our team. Our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. And that is really, really important in the challenging environment we are experiencing today. We focused intensely on taking care of our clients. I've been really, really involved with our teammates, creating an inclusive and energizing environment, really focusing on trying to empower our teammates to learn and grow and have meaningful careers. And I think we've done a good job across the board with regard to all of our stakeholders in optimizing their long-term returns. We do all that consistent with our values. We're trustworthy, caring, one team, success, and ultimately, trying to provide a sense of happiness for our teammates, and all of the people that we have a chance to inspire and support. If you're following the presentation, on Table 5, I just want to point out some of the things that we've done, because I think in today's world, this is as important, if not, more important than the actual numbers, because our communities need a lot of help. We've been really focused on living our purpose. You've heard about our Truist Cares philanthropic initiative, where we pledge $50 million to rebuild communities. Some of the things we're doing are really, really exciting. For example, we're doing technological support in areas that are un-served or underserved with regard to Internet and WiFi capabilities. We're using that to support automated reading capabilities in these areas, because these kids are sheltered and placed at home, and don't have access easily to learning. We're supporting our communities, doing a lot of work with CDFIs in terms of supporting small businesses, minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, feel good about that. Just to give you a perspective, over the last few years on our onUp Movement, we provided about 6 million people with tools to provide the financial confidence. Since 2009, we've done over 12,000 community projects. We've touched over 18 million people through our Financial Foundations program, which is focused on financial literacy. In high schools, we've reached over 1 million high school students. And since the merger of equals, in very short period of time, we've provided $440 million in financing to support 2,200 affordable housing units, creating 1,400 new jobs across our footprint. We've been really focused on addressing racial and social inequity. We are expanding our efforts to advance equity, economic empowerment and education for our clients, our communities and our teammates. I'm very proud to say we observed Juneteenth holiday by giving our people time-off. We had a virtual town hall with our 3,000 of our teammates that I was able to co-host along with Ben Crump, and it was a really, really good dialog, good discussion. We've had over 200 Days of Understanding, where we bring together our teammates and give them an opportunity to just dialog and talk about what's going on, challenges that they face. Those have been really, really great sessions. I participated in some and found them to be very, very informative and helpful. We're in the process of doing even more town halls. We conducted unconscious bias training. So, we're doing a lot to try to help our communities and our teammates weather through the storm and get better through the storm. And I feel really good about that. I'll show you how this is playing out. With regard to our second quarter highlights, on Slide 6, we're very pleased that we had taxable-equivalent revenue of $5.9 billion. It was up 7%. But as you know, that was merger timing affected. We did have adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, feel good about that. Our diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $0.67, but our adjusted basis earnings were $0.82, which was very, very strong relative to the environment. Our return on average common equity on adjusted basis was 7.26%. Return on average tangible common adjusted was 14.17%. And I was very pleased that our adjusted efficiency ratio was 55.8%, which is very strong in this environment. Our asset quality in terms of actual metrics, which you can get more detail on from Clark were actually fantastic. But as we all know, that was substantially impacted by a lot of the CARES Act decisions around forbearances, et cetera. So, we know that it will get worse. That's why we're prepared well in terms of our reserving for our future allowances. We felt good about fee income, robust capital markets activity. Residential mortgage was fantastic. Our insurance brokerage operation, which really, really, is important in times like these, had a record quarter. We continue to have very good expense discipline on a core basis. And our common equity tier 1 increased about 0.4% to 9.7%. So, we felt very, very good about that. If you look on Page 7, I just want to have a few of these material special items that affected the quarter. We did have securities gains. So, these were non-agency mortgage securities that we have for a while. They had special gains and some risk of downside loss for those gains. And so, there was a good opportunity for us to take those. That did provide $300 million of pre-tax gain or $0.17 a diluted share. Now, we use most of that to extinguish debt. We took a loss on debt of $235 million before tax. That improves forward run rate, which Daryl can give you detail on, but that was very good. That was a negative $0.13. We did have substantial merger-related and restructuring charges of $209 million that was $0.12 negative. And then, as we've explained to you, we do have incremental operating expenses that are related to the merger. They're not technically merger-related that we call out in a category. But they're not a part of our run-rate going forward. So, we consider those to be unusual and that's $0.07. So, when you net through all that, it will be a positive impact of about $0.15. If you look at Slide 8, just a few comments with regard to loans, it was a very interesting quarter for loans. I mean, at the beginning of the quarter, loans were booming. We were having line draws like everybody else that were substantial. We were engaged in PPP, where we were the third largest PPP producer, producing about $13 billion in those loans. We were happy to do that, although it was very hard in terms of supporting our small business clients. There was not much normal loan activity in the quarter. So, it was just kind of an unusual quarter. Our average balances were $322 billion versus a $315 billion end of period. So, you can see what happened. We advanced up all the lines, and then they started paying down, so now 80% of the COVID-related line advances have already been paid. So that activity was kind of a roller coaster, it's settled down now, and we feel good about where we are. Consumer loans decreased slightly in this stressed environment just because people broadly speaking, are spending less. We did see a decrease in residential mortgage on the loans that we hold, but our mortgage business is generally booming. We had mortgage applications of $21.3 billion in second quarter and we originated $14.6 billion in the quarter. So, we were really, really active in that, and frankly, moving resources into the mortgage area, that's a very, very important area for us. We did have substantial activity increasing loans in indirect, which was primarily due to huge demand for loans to finance recreational and power sports. So, we are seeing some robust activity in some categories, some temporary robust activity in others. The underlying normal activity is, I'd say, relatively stable, not going down, not going up. There's just not much going on right now on reasons you would understand. So, we feel overall good about our loan book and loan activity. And we think we're well positioned as we go forward with confident returns to be able to meet the needs of our clients. Just a couple of comments with regard to deposits on Slide 9. Deposits are booming. Our noninterest-bearing deposits were $113 billion, up $20.7 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Total deposits were $36 billion on the same linked-quarter basis. I will tell you that the majority of that is core, but there are search balances related to line draws, PPP loans and government stimulus. We believe there continues to be a flight to quality and we're the beneficiary of that. Business accounts drove about 80% of the growth in DDA. So that was what you would expect, businesses drawing on lines, investing into deposit accounts, et cetera. Our deposit mix for the second quarter consisted of 34.7% noninterest-bearing deposits, which is very strong, 26% on interest-bearing, 34% of money market, and savings were 8.9%. Our cost of average deposits and average interest-bearing deposits decreased 29 basis points and 38 basis points, respectively, down to 22 and 32, respectively. So, it's a very, very strong story for deposits, I will say that we have real opportunity in terms of our interest-bearing deposits at 32 basis points. We didn't move them down as aggressively in the second quarter, maybe some did. We've wanted our clients have time to adjust. I would see there's a real opportunity for us as we move into third quarter, and we're already taking very bold and decisive action with regard to that. So, let me turn it now to Daryl for some more detail. Thanks, Daryl. So, if you follow along on Slide 20, I just want to mention a few things about how we're doing. The good news is our cultural development is fantastic. In fact, I would say that it is accelerating because of the challenges, because people are facing some extremely difficult challenges day-to-day. And that really kind of pulls the groups together. The sense of team-play in the organization today is phenomenal, far better than I could have ever hoped for. So, we feel great about how we're doing in terms of the organizations coming together. Had some really good recent developments, we branded Truist Insurance and Truist Foundation. We introduced Advisor Desktop to heritage BB&T Financial Advisors. And we were able to consolidate social media platform, leveraging Truist.com. Our conversions are in many cases right on schedule, for example, institutional broker dealer, mortgage origination and wealth are right on schedule for the second half of this year and the first half of next year. We did tell you last quarter and throughout the quarter that we were reassessing the core bank conversion, because of all of the challenging circumstances that we've all faced. Those include, amongst others, a strategic reallocation of resources for the COVID response. When all of this hit, we had to focus on what was the most important at the moment. For example, we spent a lot of our IT and other support resources in the PPP program, and developing portals for our clients to do automatic deferrals, and developing automatic portals for automatic scheduling, so people could schedule appointments with our people remotely. We had work-from-home transitions for Truist and our offshore vendors, as we got all of the computers into everybody's homes. That just takes a little bit of time. And we did experience some critical vendor disruptions that hampered our conversion activities. So, we want to take all that into account. We want to make sure we do it right, do it well, that's most important. And so, we now anticipate the core bank conversion will be in the first half of 2022 versus the second half of 2021. It's not a dramatic change. But it is one we wanted to report out to you. And we think it's the best way to continue to provide the highest quality service for our clients. Still, we are committed to our $1.6 billion of net cost saves as Daryl described. And we're very pleased that we're able to pull forward expense savings around facilities, vendor spend, personnel cost, so that we now expect 40% of the $1.6 billion on an annualized basis to be available to us this year by the fourth quarter. And then we stay on track with 65% for the fourth quarter of 2021, and then the full 100% on fourth quarter 2022. So, it's just a little bit of pulling forward and 2020 versus a little bit less than 2021. So, we feel good about all of that, and think that will go very, very well. Wrapping up on Slide 21, just a couple of comments with regard to the value proposition we offer. You've heard me say before and I still continue to believe this is a fantastic organization. The combination is excellent. It is fantastic for our shareholders. And the reason is this. It is an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. This is the 6th largest commercial Bank in the United States. We have strong market share in vibrant, fast-growing MSA markets. None of that has changed. We have a comprehensive business mix with distinctive capabilities in traditional banking, capital markets and insurance. And clearly, coming together, we've already experienced what we thought would happen, which is that together, we get the best of breed, best talent, best technology, best strategy and best processes. And we really saw that this quarter with the strong performance in investment banking and insurance. One from SunTrust, one from BB&T came together beautifully, just like we thought it was. We have unique positioning to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns. We feel very strong about our cost saves as we said, and the projected efficiency ratios that we talked about. We feel very confident about medium-term targets of ROTCE in the low 20%s, adjusted efficiency in the low 50%s, common equity tier 1 ratio of 10%. We're closing in on that right now. So, this is going to be a best-in-class efficient, highly profitable organization. And largely, that's because we have strong capital and strong liquidity. And we have a very resilient risk profile, very strong, prudent, experienced risk management team, conservative risk culture, diversified benefits from the merger. We stress very well, which you just saw. And so, we have a very defensive balance sheet, which is insulated by purchase accounting marks combined with CECL credit reserves. So, all of that we knew would be true. We didn't know it would be tested as much as it is being in this environment, but it really is proven to be the kind of underlying or girding support that we need to be a very resilient organization in this environment. And this is a very challenging environment. I will say to you that as difficult as it is \u2013 as difficult as it is to predict what's going to happen in the future, I believe the economy is resilient. I believe ultimately, we will be okay. I believe the American people will do the right thing to create an equitable society with hope and opportunity for everyone. Everyone wins when we have an opportunity for everybody to have an equitable future. And that's what we're working very, very hard to. Personally, I believe we will be a lot better off if we can get a lot more emphasis on love and caring for each other now to create a bright future for America and everyone in it. Let me turn it back now to Ryan. Hey, good morning. Yeah, Betsy, as you would expect, we're doing a deep dive in all of those areas to be sure that we can continue to provide high-performance profitability metrics, even as we orchestrate through this difficult environment. The pulling forward is just frankly getting more aggressive than we had even originally planned with regard to vendor renegotiations. We've got a ton of buildings, as you might expect duplicative buildings, some small, some large. We've got a major task-force working on that. And we decided to be very aggressive in terms of consolidating and eliminating a lot of those buildings. And that's pretty immediate cost reductions when you do that. We have a very aggressive personnel rationalization plan in process. And a good bit of that is already underway in 2Q as you alluded to. It will begin to flow down to the bottom line more in 3Q and 4Q as we get executing on that. The plans are well developed. And now, it's just a matter of executing on the plans. Now, keep in mind that while we're now calling this out, as we head into the remainder of this year and 2021, we also have some really good opportunities in terms of revenue. Our Integrated Relationship Management program is going extremely well. And we are redoubling our efforts with regard to that, because this is the time when our clients need us more than ever. And so, we are across the organization focusing on generating opportunities to help our clients and, of course, in the \u2013 so doing, we generate additional revenue for us. So we've got all of these expense initiatives, but they're huge revenue initiatives as well, which gives us great confidence. We're focusing on the expense with you. From day one, we didn't add in revenue opportunities as a part of projecting. But I can just tell you that the development along the way in terms of realizing those revenue synergies is going far better than I would have ever expected, including all of the COVID difficulties related to that. Yeah. And also, I didn't mention too, Betsy, so we, in addition to those items Daryl mentioned, we had COVID-related reductions in income including money back on credit card purchases, the other types of incomes, NSF reductions, waivers, so were just so pretty big number. We haven't been trying to call that out, because I think most people are trying to kind of do the same thing. But it is material. Yes. So basically on the fee waivers, we think it's about time to kind of eliminate those. To be honest, we had lot of discussion about it. But we've concluded that we got to let our clients ease back into normal life planning and financial planning. And so we've terminated that. Yeah. Thanks, Betsy. Good morning. So, on the conversion we have a full plan developed. We have timelines developed. We have all the parties lined up in terms of executing. And as I said, we're executing literally as we speak in terms of non-core bank conversions. But for the core bank, all of that is lined up and moving forward. It's a big deal, so it's challenging. But we're very confident in terms of moving forward in the timeline we've talked about. And Daryl can comment, but with regard to the efficiency ratio, you've heard me say over the years. That's just a tough ratio, because you got a numerator and a denominator. But look we're at 55.8% in adjusted in this environment, without getting the benefits of the expense cuts from the conversion materially and the revenue enhancements. So that's why we feel very, very confident getting into low-50s from where we are today. The adjusted efficiency ratio will wash out to the normal efficiency ratio, because the \u2013 all the merger unusual costs now will go away. And so we feel very confident about that. So that \u2013 even if rates stay relatively low, I'm optimistic we can get down to that kind of level. Obviously, if rates go up, then that really helps. Good morning. Good morning. Yeah. One of the interesting things that we're finding, but I must admit I was a little bit positively surprised about is the resiliency of our clients, when we talked to our regional presidents and our people that are dealing direct with clients. In many, many cases, they're saying, well, the clients feel pretty good given the environment and the reason is because they learned their lesson 10 years ago in the Great Recession. And when this hit, they acted fast. They held their expenses. They tried to be creative in terms of generating other revenues. And they're hanging on much, much better than I might have expected. Now they're \u2013 some of the tiniest, micros all businesses are having the hardest time because they don't any rainy-day funds. They live kind of day to day. But for most of our small business clients, they have some resiliency, but mostly they responded very fast. So now if it hangs on a long time, it's just going to be hard. But if this recovers reasonably quickly, I think we may be pleasantly surprised at how well our business community actually [recovers] [ph]. Hi, Gerard. Good morning."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Christopher Henson",
            "content": "Yeah, Betsy, this is Chris. I would add, under Truist Cares, we did things like 5% cashback for grocery and pharmacy, ATM fees for waivers for clients and non-clients. We did for the EIP, a 30-day relief credit for those who did not have balances. And so, all those things to the point I think Kelly and Daryl making, we'll come back to is, we've also had some service charge, bank card, check card challenges, which will come back, at least certainly a large portion of that will come back in 2021 as well. Okay. It's certainly up full run rate in 2020, yeah. Sure. Happy to, Mike. This is Chris. Yeah, really excited about the quarter. It was a record quarter, as Kelly alluded to earlier. And the three drivers of organic growth was pricing and retention of new business. And so the \u2013 prior to COVID, they were all kind of hitting all cylinders, and what you have now as new businesses driven by GDP and uncertainty due to COVID tailing down a bit. But pricing is really robust. So what we had in the quarter was pricing last quarter was up in the 4.5% range closer to 5% this quarter. As anticipate, we'll continue to see acceleration for the remainder of this year and into 2021, I'll touch on why in just a minute. Client retention was, in retail, 90.3%, 84.1% in wholesale, also very strong, but what you're seeing there is a bit of a shift with the COVID uncertainties. You're beginning to see some of the standard carriers that support retail to really sort of pull back and refer to wholesale, which gets underwritten in the E&S market that supports the wholesale. So over a period of a year, you're seeing a little bit of \u2013 maybe a couple of percent down in retail, but up about 4% at wholesale. And that really underscores sort of the power of our diversified model, because we play in both channels. In fact, in wholesale, you might even get just to touch on margin in today's world, so that we actually benefit in that situation. New business production, where we were up maybe double digits last quarter, we're down 4%. But what I would say there is, while \u2013 and that's really driven by GDP, what's going on in the economy, uncertainty due to COVID. But I would tell you that overall outlook is much more positive, because of the price firming I just talked about. And we also saw in the quarter more stable exposure units than we'd expect. We just did not see the business failures. It was just a limited number of business failures and also the growing excess and surplus lines volume, the shift from retail to wholesale that I had commented on just a minute. So in the quarter what all that gave us was organic growth in the 2.1% range. I think what I had said was sort of a flat to 2%, and we were right on the upper end of that range. So I felt very, very good about it in a market that I think some might would have expected flat to slightly down. Just another touch on pricing. You really are seeing upward momentum. I think we're going to continue to see all coverage types were up, except workers comp. All sizes were up at least in the sort of 4.5%, 5.5% range. You saw things like D&O up 9.3%, liability \u2013 professional liability up, 6%, 7%, business interruption up 6%. I mean, those are big numbers. So what we would expect in the third quarter, because of what Daryl had said earlier, was our \u2013 we're going out \u2013 we're coming out of the second quarter, which is our strongest quarter of the year to our weakest quarter of the year, the third quarter, which is purely seasonal. So you'll see something down in the 13%, 14% range. But for the year, we're still forecasting organic growth, what would be soft in third and fourth quarter. We're still seeing it in low-single-digits for the remainder of 2020 was really pricing sort of leading the way. So we feel really strong, really good about it. And Mike, it's Chris, again. I might just comment on mortgage. We had, as Kelly alluded to just an exceptional mortgage quarter this quarter. And Daryl said that we might expect it to tail down and touch I will tell you production, we think is going to be just as strong, maybe even a little stronger. It's just as the industry brings on more capacity, the margin is going to tail down to touch. So I mean, we're in a 319 kind of range this quarter, and that combines retail at 450 and correspondent a touch lower. But you're still going to probably have in the mid- to upper-2s, kind of margin. And you got additional servicing costs as Daryl pointed out, but still going to be a very strong year. I mean, the kind of year that would have been, frankly, I mean, kind of quarter, it would have been a year to the old BB&T. So very substantial kind of numbers overall. And this is Chris, Kelly. Just to reinforce your point over half of our 24 regions are actually on goal for lending business to date. And what's really good to see is to the top regions or like West Virginia and Virginia West, some of our core \u2013 corest of core regions. And so I absolutely agree with what you're saying."

And now, I will turn it over to Kelly.\nKelly King: Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call. I certainly hope you and your families are safe and well in the difficult environment we're all living in.  I want to take a minute before we get into the numbers to just talk about culture because I believe, now more than ever, culture matters most of all of the things we can talk about.  So, you've heard us say that our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. This is absolutely a critical time for us to live out that purpose. So, our mission is focusing on our clients, our teammates and our stakeholders \u2013 in that order \u2013 and we do that very, very seriously every day.  Our values are to be trustworthy, caring, operate as one team, focus on success and, ultimately, happiness for our teammates. We're focusing during this environment, number one, on the health and safety of our teammates. We are pleased that about 35,000 of our 58,000 teammates are able to work remotely.  We are spending a lot of time supporting our clients, particularly on the Payroll Protection Program. We're spending a lot of energy and focus supporting our communities through our Truist Cares $25 million philanthropic donations that we did early in the cycle.  I'll tell you that our teammates are working really, really hard. They're working 24/7 in many cases. They're working very, very closely together. It's incredible to see the kind of positive results that we're getting, particularly like in the PPP program where our people were able to stand up literally overnight, an automated portal to allow our clients to access automatically with us in terms of getting their applications in.  Our teammates are bonding faster than we would ever have expected. And I can say to you today that our culture at Truist is really, really strong.  If you're following on the presentation, I'm on slide 5. Just as a reminder, after the combination, we're the sixth largest US commercial bank by assets and market value. We have a very strong, number 2 weighted average deposit market share in the top 20 MSAs. We have 12 million households, 58,000 teammates. We are very well positioned, we think, to achieve our purpose.  We are recognized as one of the highest rated financial institutions, and we're continuing to grow loans and deposits, particularly in this period of flight to quality. Daryl is going to cover a lot of information about our very strong capital and liquidity in just a bit. I would point out that our diversification is a real strength. We are very diversified in products, services and geographies.  On slide 6, we talk about some of the things we're doing with regard to the crisis. Like others, we have been providing payment relief assistance, including forbearance, deferrals, extensions, other ways we can help our clients. We've already done over 300,000 accommodations for consumers, 16,000 for our commercial clients. We've temporarily waived ATM surcharges. And we're uniquely offering a 5% cashback on qualifying card purchases for important basic needs.  We're real pleased that we've been able to continue to allow appointment interventions with our clients in terms of particular needs they have. We're fortunate that 90% of our branches have drive-throughs, so we've been able to keep those branches open in terms of activity.  We've been really focused on the Paycheck Protection Program. Our average loan amount is about 323,000. We've been authorized for 32,000 companies, representing about 1 million employees. And we're expecting funding to be a little more than $10 billion on the first round, and it will likely be more on the second round, if it is in fact approved.  We're providing financial relief programs for small businesses in many other ways also. And we've been able to fund, without hesitation, extensive line draws for our commercial clients.  For our teammates, we've awarded $1,200 coronavirus relief bonuses to about 78% of our teammates making less than $100,000 a year. We've been very aggressive in providing work from home and other alternative work strategies for our teammates to provide safety for them.  We also increased our onsite special rate pay for those that have to be at work in critical roles, with $6.25 special pay for those on hourly and $50 a day for those that are not.  Our Truist Foundation is contributing $4 for every $1 that our Truist teammates donate to our One Team Fund, which helps our teammates that are in financial hardship and need assistance. For our communities, we announced earlier a $25 million philanthropic contribution which has really gone a long way to help. We donated $1 million for each of the CDC Foundation and Johns Hopkins. And our Truist Foundation donated $3 million to local United Way organizations. On page seven, just a few financial highlights. We did have $5.6 billion in taxable-equivalent revenue. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $1.18 billion. Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis was $0.87. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted was 15.5%, which is very strong in this environment. And our adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.4%. So, we feel really good about that.  Our January and February, like a lot of people, were really strong. And then we, of course, ran into all the challenges that we're all experiencing because of COVID-19. Interestingly, insurance and mortgage continued to have strong performance throughout the entire quarter.  Our asset quality, as Clarke will describe to you, is actually very good right now, but we know that's the calm before the storm. And that's why we added a strong $893 million provision in anticipation of the challenges that we know we will face.  We have a tight focus on our teammates and our clients and our communities, which we believe is our job number one right now. If you go to slide 8, just a couple of the unusual items this quarter. We know it's a little messy, but we got the issue of the merger and the COVID impact. While merger-related charges are $107 million before tax, about $0.06 negative impact after tax, the incremental operating expenses, these are ones that provide future benefits, but they're not a part of the ongoing run rate, so we call them out separately, and that's $74 million or $0.04 a share. And then, the COVID impact in terms of cost and foregone revenues is about $71 million or $0.04. So, there really is, in my view, about $0.14 of unusual items, which gets you to the $0.87.  If you go to deck 9, slide 9, in loans and leases, it's been an interesting period. You can see that our first quarter average loans was $301 billion, but by the end of the period, it was $319 billion. Obviously, we had a surge at the end of March. We had about $18 billion in drawdowns. That continued into early part of April. We had another about $1.4 billion. Again, it's kind of subsided. It's been relatively flat since then. We do expect substantial PPP funding. As I said, we have in process about $10 billion in committed loans and we expect will be drawn down relatively soon.  In terms of the market, everybody wants to know what's going to happen. I do too. But the truth is we just don't know. It depends, obviously, on the depth and the length of the health crisis as we work through that, and then how that has the knock-off effect with regard to the economy.  The good news is, going into this, the economy was very strong. The bad news is small business will really struggle to recover from this. Still, I would say to you, Americans are resilient and I believe our country is likely to outperform the worst expectations.  If you look at deposits on page 10, same kind of thing. Average balances were $334 billion. It popped up to $350 billion as we had an increase of $15 billion during that period of time. About $7 billion of that was line draws, but then we also had some seasonal increases and some flight-to-quality deposits that moved in, which we're very pleased to see. Our total average cost of deposits decreased by 6 basis points, which we're very happy to see.  So, let me turn it to Daryl now and let him give you some detail. \nDaryl Bible : Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to talk about the key points from the first quarter and provide some color on current business conditions.  Turning to slide 11, net interest margin of 3.58% up 17 basis points. Purchase accounting contributed 52 basis points to reported net interest margin.  Core net interest margin was 3.06%, down 8 basis points. The decline reflected the full quarter impact of the merger of equals, lower interest rates and our liquidity build in March.  The yield on loans and leases held for investment increased 8 basis points as the benefit from purchase accounting more than offset lower short-term rates.  The yield on our securities portfolio decreased 3 basis points. We became more asset sensitive due to floating rate loan growth, expected higher prepayment, trimming out Federal Home Loan Bank advances and increased non-interest bearing deposits. Our loan mix was 55% floating and 45% fixed. Current trends suggest our net interest margin will decline further from a full quarter impact of lower rates, line draws, PPP funding and elevated reserves at the Fed. To protect loan yields, we are implementing towards an all new production and we continue to aggressively reduce deposit costs.  Turning to slide 12. Non-interest income increased $563 million, reflecting a full quarter on the merger of equals.  Insurance income increased $39 million or 7.6% versus first quarter 2019 due to higher P&C commissions, organic growth, strong retention and increased pricing.  Residential mortgage income was strong, with origination volumes at $11.7 billion. Refi was 56% of originations and gain on sale margins were 176 basis points. While forbearance is a potential headwind, that could be offset by higher volume and spreads.  This quarter, several fee income categories were impacted by the pandemic. Investment banking and trading was impacted by $92 million due to the increase in CVA reserves arising from lower interest rates and wider credit spreads.  As shown on the slide, discretionary actions resulted in lower service charges on deposits and card and payment-related fees. Current trends include seasonally strong insurance income, strong residential mortgage production, partially offset by lower service income due to forbearance, lower asset valuations and lower purchase volume related to COVID.  Turning to slide 13. Non-interest expense increased $856 million, reflecting a full quarter impact from the merger. Merger-related costs included $107 million of merger-related and restructuring charges and $74 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger.  Discretionary actions in response to COVID impacted non-interest expense by approximately $65 million and included a $1,200 bonus to all teammates earning less than $100,000.  Personnel expense included $44 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. This was positively impacted by the decrease in the market value of non-qualified plan assets, which is offset in net interest income and other income.  We also updated our intangible valuation. As a result, annualized full-year amortization expense for 2020 was revised to about $660 million.  Current trends in expenses include relief measures, such as special pay for some client-facing teammates, and measures to better protect our teammates, clients and communities. We continue to have good core expense discipline even in the face of COVID health crisis.  Turning to slide 14. Asset quality remained strong, but economic conditions have deteriorated. Truist will continue to apply the CECL standard adopted January 1.  Our MPA ratio increased 9 basis points to 23 basis points, largely due to the adoption of CECL and the transition from PCI to PCD.  NPLs were 32 basis points to total loans, up 17 basis points from year-end, primarily due to the PCI to PCD transition. Adjusting for this transition, our MPA and MPR ratios were essentially flat from last quarter.  Net charge-offs were 36 basis points of average loans, down 4 basis points. The provision was $893 million and reflected the reserving in accordance with CECL. The increased provision was mostly due to a significant loan growth and scenarios reflecting a weaker economic outlook. The increase also reflected a full quarter of post-merger activity. Our allowance coverage ratio was 1.63%. The combination of our allowance and the unamortized fair value mark remains a very robust 2.71% of total loans. The adoption of CECL resulted in strong coverage ratios at 4.76 times for net charge-offs and 5.04 times for NPLs. We expect second quarter asset quality matrix to be elevated reflecting COVID stress across the loan portfolios.  Turning to slide 15. The table on the left summarizes our exposure to industries we believe are most vulnerable in the current environment. We have very low exposure, reflecting meaningful diversification from our merger. Outstanding loans to the group totaled $28.4 billion or 8.9% of loans held for investment at the end of March. Our oil and gas portfolio is weighted towards lower risk sectors.  Outstanding balances on levered loans totaled $10.5 billion or $3.3 billion of loans held for investment. 42% of our leveraged loans are investment grade or the equivalent. We are actively managing these portfolios and will continue to make underwriting or risk acceptance adjustments as appropriate.  Turning to slide 16. The $582 million increase in the ACL from the initial CECL adoption reflects rapidly evolving market conditions. Our standard practice is to use three scenarios to inform the CECL allowance, implying judgment to assign the probability of each scenario.  These scenarios include Moody's baseline with implied rates for an optimistic scenario and one stress scenario. We also consider heightened industry concerns from the pandemic effects, together with the impact of government relief packages when calculating the CECL estimate. Slide 17 adds additional details on our loss estimation approach.  Turning to slide 18, our capital ratios declined slightly, mostly due to a significant balance sheet growth related to line draws. However, our capital levels remain strong relative to regulatory levels for well capitalized banks.  Our CET1 ratio was 9.3%, down 9.5% in the fourth quarter. Our dividend and total payouts are 61.4% for the first quarter.  We are taking a prudent approach to capital due to the uncertainty of the economy. Our CCAR submission incorporated this impact. Ending CET1 ratios for the internal baseline and severely adverse scenarios well exceeded regulatory minimums and internal post stress policy goals.  We intend to utilize the five-year CECL transition for regulatory capital purposes, which provides a 17 basis point benefit to CET1. We expect to grow capital and serve our clients throughout this challenging time.  Turning to slide 19. This slide shows the second best performance among peers under stress conditions and from a capital resiliency perspective due to strong PPNR and lower credit losses.  The table compares credit loss reserves reported by Truist and its peers at March 31 to their respective stress losses under 2018 DFAST. We use stress losses from 2018 as this was the last year the Fed published DFAST results for BB&T and SunTrust. We think that 2019 will be similar given the improved risk profile and earnings power of the combined company.  As the column on the right shows, Truist's 35% ratio of credit loss reserves to stress losses is above the peer average of 33%. However, after layering in the unamortized fair value marks on the SunTrust portfolio, which totaled $3.5 billion on March 31, Truist stress loss coverage increased to 58%.  This is a great illustration of how the merger enhanced the risk profile of both companies and resulted in a defensive balance sheet that is insulated by purchase accounting marks and CECL reserves. It is also another example of why we believe we are better together at Truist. Turning to slide 20, we acted quickly in response to the pandemic to term out short-term borrowings and increased cash to meet capital funding needs. As such, our liquidity ratios remain strong, with an average LCR of 117% and a liquid asset buffer of 19.6%. Our access to secure funding sources remains robust.  We have experienced a flight to quality amid recent market volatility, with total deposits increasing $15.5 billion and we continue to see robust growth this quarter. We have sufficient liquidity to fund our PPP loans from our existing Fed balances at the Fed.  In addition, holding company cash is sufficient to cover 17 months of contractual expected outflows with no inflows.  We are withdrawing our guidance for 2020, given the uncertainty going forward. For the second quarter, we're providing guidance on several categories based on linked-quarter changes versus the first quarter of 2020.  We expect earning assets to grow in excess of 5% on linked quarter average basis, reflecting the increase in loans from C&I line draws and the PPP program.  Total taxable-equivalent revenue will be down a few percent linked-quarter, reflecting a meaningful decline in net interest margin, driven by lower rates, liquidity build and fee income pressure, as noted earlier. Core non-interest expense, adjusted for the merger, amortization and COVID expenses, is expected to be flat linked-quarter, excluding the adjustment to the non-qualified plan. We're making good progress, generating savings some third-party spend and facilities optimization.  Depending on the length of the economic downturn, how deep the downturn goes, and how effective the government programs play out will influence scenarios that unfold. You can see net charge-offs increase throughout the year and possibly add more pressure, so there will be allowance. We are also striving to achieve positive operating leverage despite this challenging environment.  Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger and closing thoughts and Q&A. \nKelly King : Thanks, Daryl. So, in terms of the accomplishments \u2013 and keep in mind, we really just merged these two companies in December. So, we've accomplished a lot. Most importantly, we rolled out the Truist culture. We were able to complete 32 townhall meetings. We had a few at the very end that we had to cancel or defer because of COVID-19, but we got through most of the enterprise and the reception to it was extremely good.  We introduced and rolled out the Truist visual identity and logo. We did complete the purchase of Truist Center, which is our corporate headquarters here in Charlotte. We launched our Truist Foundation.  And we were able to go ahead and begin consolidating some redundant real estate portfolios that we had that we could go ahead and begin to get some early cost saves.  So, in terms of the next steps, if you think about it right now, we really have two major priorities. Number one priority is focusing on COVID-19. We're laser focused on taking care of our teammates, making sure everybody's safe and well. We're doing everything we can possibly do to support our clients, not only in terms of their safety, in terms of interaction with us, but also in terms of helping them sustain the economic challenges that are going along with this terrible experience we're all going through. We're trying to be very willing to invest and be creative in terms of how to support our communities, and we're doing some really interesting things there in terms of broadband and all types of things that we can do to help communities that are really, really struggling.  So, the second priority, of course, is keeping the integration and conversion on track. We believe we are in a good place there. It's hard to know exactly what may happen with regard to any delays. It really depends on the depth and the length of the health crisis. But at this point, we still feel good about where we are in terms of our planned conversion and integration activities.  In terms of our performance targets, we still believe in the medium term. We would project a return on tangible common equity in the low 20s, adjusted efficiency in the low 50s. You can see we're already pretty much there. And we're still remaining very confident in terms of our $1.6 billion in net cost saves.  Exactly when we achieve that kind of depends on, obviously, the environment we're living in. If it's a V, then we'll recover pretty quickly and we'll hit these in the not-too-distant medium target type of range. If it's a U, it will take a little bit longer, and that's just pretty obvious.  Regardless, we believe that we will be a top-tier performer, whatever the absolute numbers are. I will say to you that all of the benefits of the merger look better now than they did a year ago.  Finally, if you look at our value proposition slide, we believe we provide a really strong value proposition. We are a purpose-driven company, committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. That's really important, more important than ever in today's world.  We have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. We have strong market share and vibrant fast-growing MSAs in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and a growing national presence. We have a very comprehensive and diverse business mix in banking, capital markets and insurance.  And very importantly, we are simply better together. We're stronger. We're more resilient. We have best-in-breed in terms of talent, technology, strategy and processes.  We are very uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns, while investing in the future. As I said, we have net $1.6 billion of net cost saves yet to come. These complementary businesses are clearly going to yield substantial revenue increases as we develop the synergies.  Our returns and capital are buoyed by purchase accounting accretion, which Daryl has described to you, and we're making meaningful investments in technology capabilities, our teammates, marketing and advertising. We have a very strong capital and liquidity with resilient risk profile, enhanced by the merger. We are very prudent and disciplined in risk management and financial management. We have a very conservative risk culture, leading credit metrics among the highest-rated large banks.  We have diversification benefits that arise from the merger we discussed. We stress test very, very well \u2013 separately and together. We have a very strong capital and liquidity position and being enhanced even with the flight to quality.  And we have a very defensive and, I would call it, strong and resilient balance sheet supported by purchase accounting marks combined with the CECL credit reserves.  Because of the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity, I would expect us to continue our dividend as we move forward into as far as we can see.  So, like I said in January, if you liked us a year ago, you should love us now, but we continue to believe our best days are ahead. Ryan, I'll turn it back over to you. \nRyan Richards : Thank you, Kelly. John, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? \nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Saul Martinez of UBS. Please go ahead. \nSaul Martinez: Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit about the outlook for credit and the interplay with the accounting and a lot of the moving parts there. So, on slide 16, you go through your day one, January 1 true-up and the additional reserve builds in the first quarter. But, Daryl, how much of it \u2013 can you just tell us how much of the $3.5 billion credit mark is \u2013 $3.5 billion loan mark, sorry, is for credit versus liquidity and rates? \nDaryl Bible: Yeah, Saul. So, first, I would tell you, when we came up with our day one estimate on our reserve, we had three scenarios that we came up with. And we weighted our stress scenario 40% on day one. So, we started the year off with a strong reserve from that perspective.  When we moved over and made our provision this quarter, we went through multiple scenarios as we always run. And then, with Moody's changing their scenarios every few days, we actually ended up running 10 different scenarios through quarter-end into early April, trying to use an overlay to help us adjust on that CECL number that we came up with.  And then, at the end of the day, you go back to using expert judgment. And we always have qualitative factors this year, for this time. Clarke and Ellen and the team really had to spend a lot of time qualitatively because the models have limitations when a government's infusing over $5 trillion and they have to weigh in on what the effectiveness is. You have all these payment plans basically out there. And you need the expert judgments on how effective those programs might be. So, there's lots of qualitative adjustments that we came up with. We feel very good about the reserves that we have there.  As far as your fair value mark, it's a combination of credit, liquidity and interest rate, and it's at $3.5 billion. \nSaul Martinez: Okay. How much of that is credit versus industry?\nDaryl Bible: We didn't disclose that, Saul. \nSaul Martinez: Okay. \nDaryl Bible: Saul, at the end of the day, it's all going to accrete into earnings. It's all going to be used as a lower value for when we \u2013 you get a little bit of benefit because you have a lower book value when you apply your reserves. So, it's all going to count, whether it's credit, interest rate or liquidity. It really doesn't matter. \nSaul Martinez: Okay, got it. But I'm trying to understand the loss-absorbing capacity for credit a little bit more. And then, just going forward though, you did mention that there is a possibility for reserve builds. And as I think about going forward, if the economic environment does worsen and credit does worsen more than what's sort of embedded in your outlook, how does that play out? Obviously, on the SunTrust book, you'll have to \u2013 and on your BB&T legacy book, you'll have to true-up your ACLs. But on the credit mark, if it turns out that whatever that portion of the $3.5 billion that's your credit marks is insufficient and the losses will be larger than that, how does that work in terms of the accounting? Do you need to re-estimate that down and then get a subsequent benefit on purchase accounting accretion? I guess what I'm asking is, even going forward, do you get a \u2013 is there a risk of sort of a double hit to your equity base from reserve builds and credit mark adjustments that only come back over time? \nDaryl Bible: So, when you come up with your CECL reserves, you really don't take into account the fair value mark. It is a lower book value, so you end up providing less. It really is going to depend on what I said in my prepared remarks. What happens in the economy? Is it going to be more stressful? If the government plans, how effective they're going to be and then how deep it really is. Clarke?\nClarke Starnes III: Saul, we assume through a weighted probability of all those scenarios that Daryl described and we did our estimate. We assumed very sharp initial GDP contraction, a spike in unemployment and then lingering high-single digit unemployment for the two-year reasonable supportable period. And our mean reversion was basically similar to what we experienced after the Great Recession.  And so, then we get, to Daryl's point, a good bit of sensitivity analysis around the different stress portfolios. We looked at the historical and projected redefault rates on the different mods and deferrals. And we baked all of that into our qualitative overlay. So, we feel like the estimate today is the best we know. Obviously, if things deteriorate worse, then we would have to provide more. If it holds up as we projected, then we're well reserved. \nSaul Martinez: I understand it on the CECL reserves, but on the unamortized loan mark, the losses are greater than $3.5 billion. And you recalibrate those estimates and you're now assuming [indiscernible], how does that work?\nDaryl Bible: So, you have a year to true-up your goodwill, but that's based upon any miscalculations you had at 12/6. So, we feel pretty good. We finalized all of the marks. I think I mentioned what the new amortization amount is on the intangible. So, all that was trued up this quarter. Actually, we have a table on it in the deck. So, all that kind of finalized from that perspective. We really can't go back and readjust any of that. \nSaul Martinez: Okay. Okay. So, there's no \u2013 there's not really a risk there that there's an incremental loss associated with that on top of the CECL reserve, I guess?\nDaryl Bible: That's correct. Yeah, that's right, Saul. \nSaul Martinez: Okay, thank you. All right. Thanks a lot. \nDaryl Bible: You're welcome. \nOperator: We will now take our next question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Daryl. Good morning, Kelly.\nDaryl Bible: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you share with us \u2013 it looked like your purchase accounting accretion came in stronger this quarter. Your tangible book value, obviously, jumped up to $26 a share. That was probably attributed to, I guess, stronger purchase accounting accretion. Can you give us some color on how that worked out this quarter versus maybe prior expectation? And so, we came in higher than expected and it was mainly due to loans paying off, both on the corporate side and on the consumer side. So, it was a little bit above our own estimates that we had. On a go-forward basis, I would say that you can't count on that basically over-estimating throughout the year. It's possible, but you wouldn't count on it. So, if you look at core versus reported margin, we were 52 basis points difference. I would probably think it averages closer to the 40 basis points on a consistent basis. But you never know what's going to happen on a quarter-on-quarter basis on payoffs. When people pay off their loans, you have to basically take in all the accretion. \nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then, on slide 19, which was very insightful and appreciate putting that together, can you share with us \u2013 and maybe it's just simple, the economic assumptions are not \u2013 aren't different than the stress test. But why \u2013 in CECL accounting, everyone, you and your peers, are looking at life-of-loan losses. Why aren't the reserves even higher? And yours are the highest relative to the stress losses? Why don't they match what the stress test we're testing for? Again, is it simple as the economic assumptions? \nDaryl Bible: Yeah. So, there's a difference between CECL and stress testing. Stress testing is a dynamic, living, breathing process. So, you basically have to project new volumes and grow for runoff depending on whatever happens. CECL is basically a static balance sheet with runoff assumptions. So, there's differences there.  The chart that we put in on 2019, just to give credit, we basically plagiarized that from Jason Goldberg. I give Jason a lot of credit for that. But I think on that table, it clearly shows that our reserves that we have versus the combined company's losses that we added together from 2018 is at 35%. That's a little bit above the peer group. And as you add in the fair market value, it's at 58%.  One thing to note, though, if you actually look at our company run results on a combined basis in 2018, that number was basically 44%. The reason I'm telling you that is, is that we don't have our 2020 CCAR stress results yet from the Fed. That will come later this quarter. But we do have what we submitted to the Fed a few weeks ago. And if you look at what the company run stress results were on the severely adverse, we were basically at 52%. So, I think that shows a good indication that, as we put the company together, Clarke and Ellen have really derisked a company and we just are a less riskier company than we would have been on a combined 2018 basis. So, our reserves then at 52%, and then if you add in the fair value mark, you're at 84% of our \u2013 we came up with $10.8 billion of losses in our 2020 severely adverse. \nGerard Cassidy: Very helpful. Thank you. \nDaryl Bible: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the call and the color. Two questions. One, you gave us the number of customers that have been requesting deferrals. I think it's 330,000 on the consumer side and 15,000 on the wholesale side. Can you give us a sense as to the percentage of balances that those each represent? \nClarke Starnes III: Yeah. Betsy, this is Clarke. On the consumer side, it's about $9 billion. That's for both onUps and Service for Others. So, it's about $8 billion for balance sheet. So, roughly 3%. On the commercial side, it's about roughly $10 billion or so, 5% or 6%. So, again, I would note the far majority of all of our re-agings have been with accounts that are current to start with, even in our subprime auto as an example. So, again, I think this is a very unusual environment. So, you have a lot of people that are worried that have \u2013 maybe have lost their job or maybe have not, but they're worried and they're just all little different than normal, in that most are current to start with. \nBetsy Graseck: And in your forward look on the CECL that we're just talking through, how high do you expect those numbers to go? \nDaryl Bible: It really depends on the three factors I said earlier, Betsy. Right now, we feel we are adequately reserved from what we know. There is a lot more that we don't know than what we know, though, and how things are going to impact. The government's going to have over $6 trillion of stimulus when it's all said and done. That's 3 times more than what they had in the Great Recession. We really don't know how effective those programs are going to be. So, you really need to let a lot of that play out. All of the forbearance that's been occurring right now, that all has to play out. And some of the clients may not make it. We feel really comfortable where we are reserved today, and we'll just see what happens as we move forward. \nKelly King: So, Betsy, keep in mind too that the effects of the Payroll Protection Program will keep people whole in terms of their income. And those that are furloughed, in most cases, as I understand it, their unemployment insurance because there was an increase in the normalized unemployment insurance substantially, in many cases, people have more take home income than they had before. So, it's hard to say exactly today, in the short run, that that would be a huge negative impact. Obviously, if this is extended and the government programs don't provide continued stimulus, then it will be a factor. But in the short run, the government has actually done a pretty good job in terms of providing short-term buffer. \nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then, just moving to expenses, on the $1.6 billion, I understand it's hard to know the timeframe, given everything that's going on. I'm just wondering how much of that $1.6 billion do you feel you can control today versus maybe you put on the \u2013 you put aside because it's redundancies that you don't want to touch at this stage? \nKelly King: Well, all of it is, over term, still achievable. You're right, though some of it may be deferred because of the environment we're in today. Because of more people working away from the office, the connectivity, et cetera, there may be some things that we're not able to do as quickly as we had anticipated. But our people are studying this daily. And as of today, they have not discovered any material issues that will dramatically slow down our progression in terms of integration. And the progression of the integration is what drives call centers. \nDaryl Bible: I'll give you a couple of examples. So, on third-party vendor, right now, our teams are still working on it, but we're probably 35% to 40% of the way of our target. So, we'll have about close to $100 million annual run rate save this year. And over the next couple of years, we have already locked in $135 million of that. So, that's progressing well. We're making really good progress on our corporate real estate portfolio. We have over 30,000 square feet. Right now, we have known savings in there of about $66 million of what we're executing on. If you look at what we're going through right now, with people working at home, we have to really evaluate the impacts of that after it's all said and done. But that could be an opportunity for much more saves. So, we have $30 million \u2013 we might go down to $20 million over the next three to five years. You just don't know that. So, that could be even a bigger opportunity. So those are just a few examples, Betsy. \nBetsy Graseck: Thanks.\nOperator: I will now take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nMike Mayo: Hi. A few more questions about your forward guidance. Kelly, I thought you said, maybe Daryl, talked about the potential for positive operating results this year, which seems pretty tough with your second quarter guidance. As it relates that guidance, only slight expenses in the second quarter you just mentioned \u2013 vendor, real estate, all these other things that you said that was the extra COVID effect and the other part of the guidance. Some other banks have said, expect much higher reserve building in the second quarter. I know you've given some numbers on that, but just exactly where you stand. Thank you. \nDaryl Bible: Yeah, Mike. So, I would definitely say it's going to be a challenge from linked quarter from first to second. We will continue to execute and do the best that we can within the parameters that we have. And we aren't giving up on our positive operating leverage. We're going to do the best we can. We may not achieve it this year. But we still may. It is not out of the woods. It all depends on how quickly the economy recovers. And if it's a sharp V, we have a shot at it. \nMike Mayo: And the other question, the reserve build in the second quarter, some banks are saying, 'hey, look, since the end of the first quarter, conditions have gotten worse.' I guess you said you use Moody's. I guess maybe have some flexibility to use your own capital markets group for forecast, like the larger banks. Given the decline since the end of the first quarter, would you expect more reserve building? And even though you said you're 84% reserved from, what, your 2020 bank submitted stress test, which is a big number. That's all in with your purchase accounting marks, if I got that correct? \nDaryl Bible: Yes. You're right on that. As far as \u2013 we use Moody's and we also have a couple other scenarios that we run. But we went into early April running scenarios in our reserve. So, we didn't cut it off on the 31st. We closed a little later this quarter just because we're later in the cycle. So, we went through at least the first week of April with that information. \nClarke Starnes III: Yeah. And again, if the economy actually underperforms those scenarios, we would have to provide more, but based on what we know today, we think we're well reserved, but we're certainly watching it. \nMike Mayo: Okay. And so, how much of the expense savings have you achieved so far? And you said some of the timeframes might slip. You mentioned some areas that you'll still have. You have a pandemic with the biggest merger in your history happening at the same time. So, it's a tough situation. It sounds like you're managing through it. But maybe just to get out on the table now what we should expect as opposed to waiting till later. \nDaryl Bible: Yeah. So, from specific expense savings, we have some savings and there has been some slippage just with what happened in March, in that, with COVID, some of our expenses are a little bit elevated. We pulled forward buying a bunch of our laptops and Wi-Fis and other equipment. That got pulled forward into the first quarter that we were planning on later in the year. So, a little bit elevated from that perspective. And our goal was to try to get our expenses down to 30% of the $1.6 billion by the end of the year. We are on track so far this quarter to doing that. We were trying to have some buffer and be ahead of that. It doesn't get any easier as we get into this next quarter to be honest with you. But we still have a shot at getting our 30% at the end of the year if we have a sharp recovery. \nMike Mayo: All right, thank you.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. \nJohn Pancari: Good morning. Regarding the exposures, the at-risk credit exposures on slide 15, the $28.5 billion, I know you indicate on that slide that you have qualitative overlays for the affected industries. So, can you give us a little bit more color on that \u2013 on the magnitude and maybe the amount of loan loss reserve against those portfolios and maybe the loan marks against them?\nKelly King: We haven't disclosed that level of detail. I would tell you this that, for each of those segments, we have done detailed analysis, things like risk grade notching and a good bit of sensitivity to the downside. And each and every one of those, we've looked at the modification or deferral request. And so, we've used that to add additional overlays on top of what the models would have driven in. They're considerably higher than the other segments, I will just tell you that. \nJohn Pancari: Okay. All right. And then, in terms of the insurance business, I know you indicated in your second quarter outlook that you do expect COVID could dampen the organic trends in the business. Can you give us a little bit more detail how that could play out? And is there an offset from perhaps any better pricing that you see in the industry? Just want to see how you think about how that plays out. Thanks. \nKelly King: Chris will cover that.\nChristopher Henson: Yeah. This is Chris, John. Thank you for the question. First off, we would expect second quarter to be up about 3%. That's seasonally strong this quarter of the year. And you're right, the slow down as a result of COVID really is creating declining exposure units that could be lost, people, lost business, what have you, and that will slow economic \u2013 new business production. But to your point, there will be a potential pickup in pricing.  When we went into the Great Recession, we went in with the backdrop of a soft insurance market. We go into this one \u2013 it's actually a very strong market on the back of 2017 and 2018 being the two largest [indiscernible] loss years in history. So, we're kind of in the up 4.5%, 5% range right now. If we've got to go into one, that's a good backdrop to have \u2013 if you're going to have it to back. And just for this quarter, for example, rates are up 4.5%. If you throw on top of that lower interest rates, these P&C underwriters are going to be struggling on their investment returns. So, they will likely continue to keep upward pressure on the rate environment. So, I think your intuition is exactly right.  We expect momentum in pricing for the balance of the year. But we do see tough new business reduction. So, we might have been looking at \u2013 this past quarter, we had 7.3% organic growth. Kind of looking forward, it's looking more like maybe in the flat to 2% kind of range for the balance of the year. \nJohn Pancari: Okay. Thanks, Chris. \nOperator: We will now take our next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nKenneth Usdin: Thank you. Good morning. Daryl, just wondering if we could step back out, step on the revenue side. You talked about second quarter revenues down a few percent. And just following on bit of the fee part that was just talked about, can you help us just understand NII versus fees? There's so many moving parts involved, but if you can directionally just help us understand the moving parts and direction of fees, that would be helpful. Thank you. \nDaryl Bible: Yeah. Just high level, Ken, I would tell you \u2013 and Chris commented on insurance up. Insurance is seasonally strong second quarter. That won't change from that perspective. Service charges, we have some programs in place to help our clients during this time of stress. That's what Kelly talked about, the 5% cashback. We are waiving ATM fees, so people can meet their banking services. People are coming in now, we're getting more requests for relief on NSF and we're granting that. So, I would say, service charges overall might be down a touch from that perspective. Depending on what interest rates do and credit spreads, Beau's area, while the volumes overall are lower, there is CVA, the $92 million, that line item has a chance of recovering potentially on what happens with that. And then, mortgage, mortgage will have good volumes, strong. The offset will be the impact on forbearance on the servicing. We did try to factor in some estimates on the MSR valuation already. We don't know if that's the full impact of that, but it is embedded in there. So, we did adjust for that accordingly. So, mortgage will probably have a decent quarter would be my guess. \nKenneth Usdin: And on the NII side, also can you just help us understand, your balance sheet looks like it's going to keep growing. You mentioned the difference between stated and core NIM. But can you help us understand \u2013 a lot of other peers are talking about NII growing from here. You guys have the purchase accounting as an extra factor in that. Any way you can help us just parse out the moving parts there too? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. I don't foresee \u2013 unless purchase accounting really is stronger than we think, I don't foresee NII being positive second quarter versus first.  Core margin, if you looked at our sensitivity, and you probably need to go back to our disclosures back in January when we disclosed, what, down 100 basis points \u2013 our disclosures that we show on our earnings reports are gradual. So, that's assuming that the 100 basis points would go down throughout the 12 months. And at that point in January, it was a negative 1.78% or 1.72%. If you say, that's equivalent to, like, a shock of 50. So, what we experienced in March was a shock of 150. Now, you had a little bit weird going on with LIBOR. And LIBOR, we'll talk about in a second. So, you had a shock of 150. So, if you take the 1.72% and multiply it by 3, that would probably be what the impact would be, rough estimate, on what our NII change might be for second quarter from that perspective. Then we have built a lot of liquidity. Now, we built liquidity because we were in a stress period, we want to make sure we can meet our clients' need both from a funding and from a deposit perspective. So, the cost of carrying what we're carrying at the Fed right now is anywhere from 10 basis points to 15 basis points.  If you look at our balance sheet right now, and through Friday on March \u2013 or on April 17, our balance sheet, the total balances are $518 billion. Our deposits now are $364 billion. So, all the government stimulus checks that started to come in last week, we had one day, I think it was Wednesday, where we went up $6 billion in deposits in that one time period. Our PPP funding is going to start going on the books. It started last week. It's going to go on this week and the following week. We'll probably have $330 billion of loans. So, we're definitely going to have much higher earning assets.  The other thing I would note is that our deposit costs, we were at 70 basis points, down 12 basis points on an interest-bearing basis. And if you look at March, our interest-bearing deposit costs were already 56 basis points. When you go back and look at the Great Recession and you look at how far the deposit costs get down to back then, we got down to about 23 basis points. So, I don't think we're going to get to 23 basis points in the second quarter, but we're going to get in the 20s for sure over the next couple quarters as we continue to push down rates if these rates stay where they are.  So, I think we've got a lot of things that we have to manage with, but our margin will be down, will be down because of liquidity. But once we feel that the stress is over, we can reverse the liquidity pressure there pretty easily and get that core margin back. So, hopefully, that's helpful. \nKenneth Usdin: Very much so, Daryl. We're going to talk about LIBOR. And that is a point I was wondering if you could talk about. How are you seeing LIBOR normalize down as you look out over time? Thanks for all the color. \nDaryl Bible: Yeah. So, it peaked on April 1 at 1.02%. It's now at 0.67%, one-month LIBOR. We have about $130 billion net LIBOR assets tied to one-month LIBOR right now. So, as that migrates down, that will kind of put in that full effect of that interest rate sensitivity that you saw there. We aren't there yet. It still has room to come down some more, but that will also allow us to push down our deposit costs faster too as LIBOR is coming down as well. And when you look at the money market equivalent, that will all kind of come down together. It will hurt our asset side, but we're going to make it up on the deposit side. \nKenneth Usdin: Got it. Thanks very much. \nDaryl Bible: You're welcome. \nOperator: We will now take our next question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nMatthew O'Connor: Good morning. You guys have addressed the risk that some of the integration gets delayed if we don't get a V-shaped recovery here. I guess, on the flip side, the risk of losing customers and staff to competitors is probably a lot less than maybe some people feared, partly because the virus, partly the action that you're doing for your staff, being very generous. So, maybe you could just talk, Kelly, Bill, about the engagement of your staff and how you keep the cultures, kind of both of them in the same direction. You can't do it from the town halls that you were doing before. But talk about some of those kind of softer aspects of the doing the business and your customer base \u2013 employee base. Thanks. \nKelly King: Bill, why don't you go ahead and maybe I'll add a comment at the end?\nWilliam Rogers, Jr.: Okay. Thanks, Matt. I think as you point out, the retention numbers were already good coming in from a teammate perspective. And we just did a survey that was an engagement proxy. And in this incredible environment, the survey actually showed high levels of engagement from our teammates.  In many ways, the cultural integration has been accelerated by months, if not years, because people are operating under stressful conditions. The teamwork has been spectacular. I think, Kelly, you would echo that. No one's wearing a jersey because they're all headed towards the same objective.  So, I think you point out accurately, there are elements of this that are advantageous as we go through this process. And I've personally been just really, really proud of the work that our teammates have done.  The town halls and the rollout of purpose, mission and values, we were well underway there, and that has been a really good catalyst because everybody's got something to lean forward on. They're all speaking the same language and operating from the same playbook. \nKelly King: And I will just point out one additional point. I said earlier, culture matters always. It really matters in a time like this. A really big part of our culture is just taking care of our teammates. We get that our clients come first, but you can't take care of your clients without doing a really good job for your teammates. So, Truist is unique in terms of having a fully paid for pension plan, 6%-on-6% 401(k) match. And then, we do things like $1,200 bonuses and premium pay for people on the lines. So, all of those things, our teammates really appreciate. And so, they see that, during difficult times, we're going to take care of them even if there's some sacrifice in terms of short-term profitability. We're going to take care of our teammates, so they can feel safe and secure, and then they can help our clients feel safe and secure. Those memories will be here for decades. And so, we feel very good about our culture. As Bill said, it is accelerating and it is strong as steel. \nMatthew O'Connor: Helpful. And then, I just have a question for Daryl. You talk about, for new loans, implementing some floors. Can you just talk about the rate, how much above the floors you are? And I assume, as loans come up for renewal, you'll attempt to do the same thing on those loans?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. So, David reported, I think a week or two ago, that the floors that he's putting in range anywhere from, I think, 25 basis points to 75 basis points from a LIBOR perspective. I think those are the floors that he's putting in from that perspective. That's the LIBOR rate, not the spread over it. \nMatthew O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. \nDaryl Bible: Welcome. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Of the $480 million in annualized cost saves that you noted, how much of that is achievable without interruption to pandemic-related support of your employees and your clients? And if I'm interpreting, Daryl, your answer to Betsy's question, $100 million of annual run rate savings from third-party vendors, $66 million from loan savings in corporate real estate. So, it sounds like at least $166 million of that $480 million would have nothing to do with supporting the employees or clients. \nKelly King: So, Erika, just one comment. Daryl, can I add? You're right. You can count, I think, in terms of expenses being bifurcated. There are expenses that are independent of kind of the LIFO effect \u2013 some of our vendor contracts, some are independent of COVID and we've seen substantial reductions in run rate of vendor contracts already and more to come.  With regard to the teammates, there's a one-time big charge we had with regard to the $1,200 bonus, but the ongoing, from this point forward, teammate charges are not marginally incremental.  And in terms of the impact on the conversion, it really depends. But today, our people are functioning very well, working offsite. And keep in mind, in the technology area, we've already \u2013 we've had thousands of people working offsite forever. So, this is not a new idea. It's just more people doing it. And so, as long as they're able to continue to do their scoping and their mapping and their programming remotely, which now we see that they can, it's not self-evident that there will be a dramatic change with regard to our integration and conversion scheduling.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. For the second quarter, Erika, we are paying a premium to our teammates right now that are on the front line. So, you're going to see an elevated charge in personnel with that. Depending on how quickly we basically can adjust from work at home, that will fade away. We also are actively getting more laptops in, so more people on the call centers can do more of their work at home. So, that will subside as we get more of that equipment in as well that we've accelerated from that perspective.  As far as the implementation of third party and facilities, as they execute and play out, that's when you get the savings. So, you may not see as much early on this year, but as it goes out throughout the year, and as we continue to move, it will start to build, such that the fourth quarter will have a higher annualized impact than what you would see at this point from that perspective. So, a lot of good things, although some of the third-party savings is tied to conversions.  Or just to be transparent, there's some big card conversions coming up, some big conversions coming up in the wealth and broker dealer areas. So, like, right now, in Joe's world, he's planning to still stay on track with an earlier conversion in his broker dealer. I think that's going to be in the first part of 2021. If that stays on track, that might miss a little bit at the end of 2020, but he wasn't supposed to be there at the end of 2020. He's scheduled more for early 2021. But if that plays out, then some of those things will come in at that point in time. So\u2026\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Stephen Scouten of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nStephen Scouten: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. First, I want to say thank you guys for the way you all are leading in community impact. Being in one of your affected communities, I'd say the leadership is appreciated and important. So, thank you guys for that.  I wanted to ask you, as it pertains to your capital and how you've talked about longer term you need to get back to 10% to regain buybacks. And I know in this environment, it's probably far ways out. But I'm just curious, how are you thinking about that number, the 9.3% CET1 versus kind of the \u2013 I think it was 8.7% if you had fully phased in the CECL impact and kind of how that pertains to that 10% target and where you think about buybacks way down the line?\nKelly King: So, nobody's thinking about buybacks today. We are in a very strong capital position and are still accreting capital. We still made $1 billion even before adjustments this year \u2013 this quarter. So, we will be steadily moving up unless there are dramatic increases in loan losses, which we would not project at this time. Again, if it's a long U, that makes a difference. We all understand that. So, we have said that our intermediate term target was 10%. We've said we did that because of the uncertainties that we knew about with regard to the merger. We said we were doing it because of uncertainties we didn't know about. We didn't know about COVID, of course. But thank goodness, we did prepare for that. And we're in a really good position. Now, as those uncertainties subside in terms of the merger integration and surely the health crisis will go away and surely the economy will improve, then we have said, and I would reaffirm, we have capital opportunities as we go forward below that 10% level. It will depend on the then existing circumstances, but there are opportunities available for our shareholders. \nDaryl Bible: The other minor point is remember that PPP loans that we're putting on the book have a zero percent risk rate. So, we put $10 billion on from the first round. That's not going to cost us any risk weighted capital.  And then, from a leverage number, even though we're going to fund it ourselves, it's not going to really cost us because we're basically just trading out at 10 basis points balance at the Fed to 100 basis points earning asset from PPP. So, from a capital perspective, those should be fine. \nStephen Scouten: Great. Helpful. And then, one other thing, I'm curious, we've seen some others in the industry kind of tighten underwriting standards around resi mortgage, HELOCs, other categories, have you guys \u2013 you've always been fairly conservative on lending. But have you further tightened any of your underwriting standards? And kind of within that, what are you seeing with the forbearance requests in terms of industry concentrations? Thank you, guys. \nClarke Starnes III: This is Clarke. I would say yes to that question. Across all our asset classes, we've done pretty extensive reviews and we have made underwriting and risk acceptance changes as appropriate. You would expect us to do. So, I think we would be more on the conservative end, and they are in place today. We've also worked hard to be very careful about what we call any non-essential lending right now, given the uncertainty.  So, as far as the modification requests, I'd say, from the commercial side, we've had a lot in the stressed industries that we laid out, things like hospitality, et cetera . And then, on the consumer side, it's been predominantly on the mortgage and all those sides right now. \nKelly King: And if you recall, we had made some adjustments with regard to our underwriting standards even pre-COVID. So, we were already anticipating a potential slowdown. We had made adjustments already. \nStephen Scouten: Thank you, guys, very much. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nChristopher Marinac: Thanks. Good morning. Daryl, is there an average life on the PPP loans that we should expect?\nDaryl Bible: Sure. Chris, we don't really have a good estimate on how much forgiveness is going to be out there. If I gave you a number, it would be a pure guess right now. So, I don't really know. Whether it goes out \u2013 my guess is, everybody's making the loans now. So, you've got a big tsunami. Remember, the SBA has to process all these forgivenesses in 60 days. It probably is going to take some time to process all that. So, my guess is it might linger on into three, four, five months before all the forgivenesses are happening, and we'll see how quickly they do that. But then, there will be some and portions of some loans that will stay the full two years. We will accrete the earnings and we're booking them at a discount. The last time I looked at our average discount that we'll put on the books, about 2.7% discount, and that will accrete in. And then, when it pays off for forgiveness, we'll take all that in at that point in time. It plays out to two years and you just earn it over that time period. \nChristopher Marinac: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks very much, guys, for all the information today. \nOperator: And we will take our final question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn McDonald: Hey, guys. Two quick follow-ups. Wondering if you could give any color on how the reserve is allocated between consumer and commercial buckets as of today?\nDaryl Bible: John, I would just say \u2013 and one noteworthy thing, for the increase for Q1, about 70% of that reserve, that provision increase was related to commercial and about 30% was consumer. I have to look and see on the split between \u2013 I guess we can get back to you on that, John. On the split in the actual allowance itself, we can get you that. \nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then, just kind of wandering \u2013 this comes up with questions frequently \u2013 is there a dumbed down example you guys could give us of how the marks absorb credit and how that helps? Is it just the idea that, if you have a write-off on a marked loan, you're marking it down from a smaller amount? So, if it was a $100 loan, you're writing it down from $95 as opposed to $100, so it's a smaller charge-off? That's kind of the question. Like, how does that mechanic work of helping absorb losses, the marks? \nDaryl Bible: Yeah, that's exactly right. So, basically, your book value is lower. So, you apply your reserve against the lower balance. So, it helps you a little bit. But I think of it as its earnings that are coming in. Those earnings can be used to provide for other provision or could fall to the bottom line from an earnings perspective. \nJohn McDonald: Meaning the PAA?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah, exactly. I think to your first question \u2013\nUnidentified Company Speaker: I've got it.\nDaryl Bible: You've got it? Yeah. John, back to your first question, the wholesale reserves for Q1 are about $2.270 billion and the consumer is $2.941 billion. \nJohn McDonald: Okay. Daryl, when you think about the loss absorbency, it comes in the form of PAA. So, you've got an extra cushion. That's how you kind of think of it absorbing losses, you have more cushion on the PAA side?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. We definitely have more absorption, more cushion from that perspective. But also, I think when you just cut \u2013 the bank coming together and the diversification of how we came together, we really don't have any really significant exposures in any of our portfolios because, as we came together, we were much more diversified. And that should play out when the new stress test come out from the Fed later this quarter. Our hope is that we're going to have a really strong PPNR, a really strong loss number and very resilient capital ratio. We should, hopefully, be well under the 250 basis points stress capital buffer. \nKelly King: And remember that, in all of our portfolios, essentially, the exposure was reduced in half because of the doubling of the denominator. So, it was an automatic diversification that's material in this kind of environment. \nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: We have no further [Technical Difficulty].\nRyan Richards: Okay. Thanks very much. And thank everyone for joining us today. Hope everybody has a good day, and please stay well. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to talk about the key points from the first quarter and provide some color on current business conditions.  Turning to slide 11, net interest margin of 3.58% up 17 basis points. Purchase accounting contributed 52 basis points to reported net interest margin.  Core net interest margin was 3.06%, down 8 basis points. The decline reflected the full quarter impact of the merger of equals, lower interest rates and our liquidity build in March.  The yield on loans and leases held for investment increased 8 basis points as the benefit from purchase accounting more than offset lower short-term rates.  The yield on our securities portfolio decreased 3 basis points. We became more asset sensitive due to floating rate loan growth, expected higher prepayment, trimming out Federal Home Loan Bank advances and increased non-interest bearing deposits. Our loan mix was 55% floating and 45% fixed. Current trends suggest our net interest margin will decline further from a full quarter impact of lower rates, line draws, PPP funding and elevated reserves at the Fed. To protect loan yields, we are implementing towards an all new production and we continue to aggressively reduce deposit costs.  Turning to slide 12. Non-interest income increased $563 million, reflecting a full quarter on the merger of equals.  Insurance income increased $39 million or 7.6% versus first quarter 2019 due to higher P&C commissions, organic growth, strong retention and increased pricing.  Residential mortgage income was strong, with origination volumes at $11.7 billion. Refi was 56% of originations and gain on sale margins were 176 basis points. While forbearance is a potential headwind, that could be offset by higher volume and spreads.  This quarter, several fee income categories were impacted by the pandemic. Investment banking and trading was impacted by $92 million due to the increase in CVA reserves arising from lower interest rates and wider credit spreads.  As shown on the slide, discretionary actions resulted in lower service charges on deposits and card and payment-related fees. Current trends include seasonally strong insurance income, strong residential mortgage production, partially offset by lower service income due to forbearance, lower asset valuations and lower purchase volume related to COVID.  Turning to slide 13. Non-interest expense increased $856 million, reflecting a full quarter impact from the merger. Merger-related costs included $107 million of merger-related and restructuring charges and $74 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger.  Discretionary actions in response to COVID impacted non-interest expense by approximately $65 million and included a $1,200 bonus to all teammates earning less than $100,000.  Personnel expense included $44 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. This was positively impacted by the decrease in the market value of non-qualified plan assets, which is offset in net interest income and other income.  We also updated our intangible valuation. As a result, annualized full-year amortization expense for 2020 was revised to about $660 million.  Current trends in expenses include relief measures, such as special pay for some client-facing teammates, and measures to better protect our teammates, clients and communities. We continue to have good core expense discipline even in the face of COVID health crisis.  Turning to slide 14. Asset quality remained strong, but economic conditions have deteriorated. Truist will continue to apply the CECL standard adopted January 1.  Our MPA ratio increased 9 basis points to 23 basis points, largely due to the adoption of CECL and the transition from PCI to PCD.  NPLs were 32 basis points to total loans, up 17 basis points from year-end, primarily due to the PCI to PCD transition. Adjusting for this transition, our MPA and MPR ratios were essentially flat from last quarter.  Net charge-offs were 36 basis points of average loans, down 4 basis points. The provision was $893 million and reflected the reserving in accordance with CECL. The increased provision was mostly due to a significant loan growth and scenarios reflecting a weaker economic outlook. The increase also reflected a full quarter of post-merger activity. Our allowance coverage ratio was 1.63%. The combination of our allowance and the unamortized fair value mark remains a very robust 2.71% of total loans. The adoption of CECL resulted in strong coverage ratios at 4.76 times for net charge-offs and 5.04 times for NPLs. We expect second quarter asset quality matrix to be elevated reflecting COVID stress across the loan portfolios.  Turning to slide 15. The table on the left summarizes our exposure to industries we believe are most vulnerable in the current environment. We have very low exposure, reflecting meaningful diversification from our merger. Outstanding loans to the group totaled $28.4 billion or 8.9% of loans held for investment at the end of March. Our oil and gas portfolio is weighted towards lower risk sectors.  Outstanding balances on levered loans totaled $10.5 billion or $3.3 billion of loans held for investment. 42% of our leveraged loans are investment grade or the equivalent. We are actively managing these portfolios and will continue to make underwriting or risk acceptance adjustments as appropriate.  Turning to slide 16. The $582 million increase in the ACL from the initial CECL adoption reflects rapidly evolving market conditions. Our standard practice is to use three scenarios to inform the CECL allowance, implying judgment to assign the probability of each scenario.  These scenarios include Moody's baseline with implied rates for an optimistic scenario and one stress scenario. We also consider heightened industry concerns from the pandemic effects, together with the impact of government relief packages when calculating the CECL estimate. Slide 17 adds additional details on our loss estimation approach.  Turning to slide 18, our capital ratios declined slightly, mostly due to a significant balance sheet growth related to line draws. However, our capital levels remain strong relative to regulatory levels for well capitalized banks.  Our CET1 ratio was 9.3%, down 9.5% in the fourth quarter. Our dividend and total payouts are 61.4% for the first quarter.  We are taking a prudent approach to capital due to the uncertainty of the economy. Our CCAR submission incorporated this impact. Ending CET1 ratios for the internal baseline and severely adverse scenarios well exceeded regulatory minimums and internal post stress policy goals.  We intend to utilize the five-year CECL transition for regulatory capital purposes, which provides a 17 basis point benefit to CET1. We expect to grow capital and serve our clients throughout this challenging time.  Turning to slide 19. This slide shows the second best performance among peers under stress conditions and from a capital resiliency perspective due to strong PPNR and lower credit losses.  The table compares credit loss reserves reported by Truist and its peers at March 31 to their respective stress losses under 2018 DFAST. We use stress losses from 2018 as this was the last year the Fed published DFAST results for BB&T and SunTrust. We think that 2019 will be similar given the improved risk profile and earnings power of the combined company.  As the column on the right shows, Truist's 35% ratio of credit loss reserves to stress losses is above the peer average of 33%. However, after layering in the unamortized fair value marks on the SunTrust portfolio, which totaled $3.5 billion on March 31, Truist stress loss coverage increased to 58%.  This is a great illustration of how the merger enhanced the risk profile of both companies and resulted in a defensive balance sheet that is insulated by purchase accounting marks and CECL reserves. It is also another example of why we believe we are better together at Truist. Turning to slide 20, we acted quickly in response to the pandemic to term out short-term borrowings and increased cash to meet capital funding needs. As such, our liquidity ratios remain strong, with an average LCR of 117% and a liquid asset buffer of 19.6%. Our access to secure funding sources remains robust.  We have experienced a flight to quality amid recent market volatility, with total deposits increasing $15.5 billion and we continue to see robust growth this quarter. We have sufficient liquidity to fund our PPP loans from our existing Fed balances at the Fed.  In addition, holding company cash is sufficient to cover 17 months of contractual expected outflows with no inflows.  We are withdrawing our guidance for 2020, given the uncertainty going forward. For the second quarter, we're providing guidance on several categories based on linked-quarter changes versus the first quarter of 2020.  We expect earning assets to grow in excess of 5% on linked quarter average basis, reflecting the increase in loans from C&I line draws and the PPP program.  Total taxable-equivalent revenue will be down a few percent linked-quarter, reflecting a meaningful decline in net interest margin, driven by lower rates, liquidity build and fee income pressure, as noted earlier. Core non-interest expense, adjusted for the merger, amortization and COVID expenses, is expected to be flat linked-quarter, excluding the adjustment to the non-qualified plan. We're making good progress, generating savings some third-party spend and facilities optimization.  Depending on the length of the economic downturn, how deep the downturn goes, and how effective the government programs play out will influence scenarios that unfold. You can see net charge-offs increase throughout the year and possibly add more pressure, so there will be allowance. We are also striving to achieve positive operating leverage despite this challenging environment.  Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger and closing thoughts and Q&A. Yeah, Saul. So, first, I would tell you, when we came up with our day one estimate on our reserve, we had three scenarios that we came up with. And we weighted our stress scenario 40% on day one. So, we started the year off with a strong reserve from that perspective.  When we moved over and made our provision this quarter, we went through multiple scenarios as we always run. And then, with Moody's changing their scenarios every few days, we actually ended up running 10 different scenarios through quarter-end into early April, trying to use an overlay to help us adjust on that CECL number that we came up with.  And then, at the end of the day, you go back to using expert judgment. And we always have qualitative factors this year, for this time. Clarke and Ellen and the team really had to spend a lot of time qualitatively because the models have limitations when a government's infusing over $5 trillion and they have to weigh in on what the effectiveness is. You have all these payment plans basically out there. And you need the expert judgments on how effective those programs might be. So, there's lots of qualitative adjustments that we came up with. We feel very good about the reserves that we have there.  As far as your fair value mark, it's a combination of credit, liquidity and interest rate, and it's at $3.5 billion. We didn't disclose that, Saul. Saul, at the end of the day, it's all going to accrete into earnings. It's all going to be used as a lower value for when we \u2013 you get a little bit of benefit because you have a lower book value when you apply your reserves. So, it's all going to count, whether it's credit, interest rate or liquidity. It really doesn't matter. So, when you come up with your CECL reserves, you really don't take into account the fair value mark. It is a lower book value, so you end up providing less. It really is going to depend on what I said in my prepared remarks. What happens in the economy? Is it going to be more stressful? If the government plans, how effective they're going to be and then how deep it really is. Clarke? So, you have a year to true-up your goodwill, but that's based upon any miscalculations you had at 12/6. So, we feel pretty good. We finalized all of the marks. I think I mentioned what the new amortization amount is on the intangible. So, all that was trued up this quarter. Actually, we have a table on it in the deck. So, all that kind of finalized from that perspective. We really can't go back and readjust any of that. That's correct. Yeah, that's right, Saul. You're welcome. Hi, Gerard. Yeah. So, there's a difference between CECL and stress testing. Stress testing is a dynamic, living, breathing process. So, you basically have to project new volumes and grow for runoff depending on whatever happens. CECL is basically a static balance sheet with runoff assumptions. So, there's differences there.  The chart that we put in on 2019, just to give credit, we basically plagiarized that from Jason Goldberg. I give Jason a lot of credit for that. But I think on that table, it clearly shows that our reserves that we have versus the combined company's losses that we added together from 2018 is at 35%. That's a little bit above the peer group. And as you add in the fair market value, it's at 58%.  One thing to note, though, if you actually look at our company run results on a combined basis in 2018, that number was basically 44%. The reason I'm telling you that is, is that we don't have our 2020 CCAR stress results yet from the Fed. That will come later this quarter. But we do have what we submitted to the Fed a few weeks ago. And if you look at what the company run stress results were on the severely adverse, we were basically at 52%. So, I think that shows a good indication that, as we put the company together, Clarke and Ellen have really derisked a company and we just are a less riskier company than we would have been on a combined 2018 basis. So, our reserves then at 52%, and then if you add in the fair value mark, you're at 84% of our \u2013 we came up with $10.8 billion of losses in our 2020 severely adverse. Thank you. It really depends on the three factors I said earlier, Betsy. Right now, we feel we are adequately reserved from what we know. There is a lot more that we don't know than what we know, though, and how things are going to impact. The government's going to have over $6 trillion of stimulus when it's all said and done. That's 3 times more than what they had in the Great Recession. We really don't know how effective those programs are going to be. So, you really need to let a lot of that play out. All of the forbearance that's been occurring right now, that all has to play out. And some of the clients may not make it. We feel really comfortable where we are reserved today, and we'll just see what happens as we move forward. I'll give you a couple of examples. So, on third-party vendor, right now, our teams are still working on it, but we're probably 35% to 40% of the way of our target. So, we'll have about close to $100 million annual run rate save this year. And over the next couple of years, we have already locked in $135 million of that. So, that's progressing well. We're making really good progress on our corporate real estate portfolio. We have over 30,000 square feet. Right now, we have known savings in there of about $66 million of what we're executing on. If you look at what we're going through right now, with people working at home, we have to really evaluate the impacts of that after it's all said and done. But that could be an opportunity for much more saves. So, we have $30 million \u2013 we might go down to $20 million over the next three to five years. You just don't know that. So, that could be even a bigger opportunity. So those are just a few examples, Betsy. Yeah, Mike. So, I would definitely say it's going to be a challenge from linked quarter from first to second. We will continue to execute and do the best that we can within the parameters that we have. And we aren't giving up on our positive operating leverage. We're going to do the best we can. We may not achieve it this year. But we still may. It is not out of the woods. It all depends on how quickly the economy recovers. And if it's a sharp V, we have a shot at it. Yes. You're right on that. As far as \u2013 we use Moody's and we also have a couple other scenarios that we run. But we went into early April running scenarios in our reserve. So, we didn't cut it off on the 31st. We closed a little later this quarter just because we're later in the cycle. So, we went through at least the first week of April with that information. Yeah. So, from specific expense savings, we have some savings and there has been some slippage just with what happened in March, in that, with COVID, some of our expenses are a little bit elevated. We pulled forward buying a bunch of our laptops and Wi-Fis and other equipment. That got pulled forward into the first quarter that we were planning on later in the year. So, a little bit elevated from that perspective. And our goal was to try to get our expenses down to 30% of the $1.6 billion by the end of the year. We are on track so far this quarter to doing that. We were trying to have some buffer and be ahead of that. It doesn't get any easier as we get into this next quarter to be honest with you. But we still have a shot at getting our 30% at the end of the year if we have a sharp recovery. Yeah. Yeah. Just high level, Ken, I would tell you \u2013 and Chris commented on insurance up. Insurance is seasonally strong second quarter. That won't change from that perspective. Service charges, we have some programs in place to help our clients during this time of stress. That's what Kelly talked about, the 5% cashback. We are waiving ATM fees, so people can meet their banking services. People are coming in now, we're getting more requests for relief on NSF and we're granting that. So, I would say, service charges overall might be down a touch from that perspective. Depending on what interest rates do and credit spreads, Beau's area, while the volumes overall are lower, there is CVA, the $92 million, that line item has a chance of recovering potentially on what happens with that. And then, mortgage, mortgage will have good volumes, strong. The offset will be the impact on forbearance on the servicing. We did try to factor in some estimates on the MSR valuation already. We don't know if that's the full impact of that, but it is embedded in there. So, we did adjust for that accordingly. So, mortgage will probably have a decent quarter would be my guess. Yeah. I don't foresee \u2013 unless purchase accounting really is stronger than we think, I don't foresee NII being positive second quarter versus first.  Core margin, if you looked at our sensitivity, and you probably need to go back to our disclosures back in January when we disclosed, what, down 100 basis points \u2013 our disclosures that we show on our earnings reports are gradual. So, that's assuming that the 100 basis points would go down throughout the 12 months. And at that point in January, it was a negative 1.78% or 1.72%. If you say, that's equivalent to, like, a shock of 50. So, what we experienced in March was a shock of 150. Now, you had a little bit weird going on with LIBOR. And LIBOR, we'll talk about in a second. So, you had a shock of 150. So, if you take the 1.72% and multiply it by 3, that would probably be what the impact would be, rough estimate, on what our NII change might be for second quarter from that perspective. Then we have built a lot of liquidity. Now, we built liquidity because we were in a stress period, we want to make sure we can meet our clients' need both from a funding and from a deposit perspective. So, the cost of carrying what we're carrying at the Fed right now is anywhere from 10 basis points to 15 basis points.  If you look at our balance sheet right now, and through Friday on March \u2013 or on April 17, our balance sheet, the total balances are $518 billion. Our deposits now are $364 billion. So, all the government stimulus checks that started to come in last week, we had one day, I think it was Wednesday, where we went up $6 billion in deposits in that one time period. Our PPP funding is going to start going on the books. It started last week. It's going to go on this week and the following week. We'll probably have $330 billion of loans. So, we're definitely going to have much higher earning assets.  The other thing I would note is that our deposit costs, we were at 70 basis points, down 12 basis points on an interest-bearing basis. And if you look at March, our interest-bearing deposit costs were already 56 basis points. When you go back and look at the Great Recession and you look at how far the deposit costs get down to back then, we got down to about 23 basis points. So, I don't think we're going to get to 23 basis points in the second quarter, but we're going to get in the 20s for sure over the next couple quarters as we continue to push down rates if these rates stay where they are.  So, I think we've got a lot of things that we have to manage with, but our margin will be down, will be down because of liquidity. But once we feel that the stress is over, we can reverse the liquidity pressure there pretty easily and get that core margin back. So, hopefully, that's helpful. Yeah. So, it peaked on April 1 at 1.02%. It's now at 0.67%, one-month LIBOR. We have about $130 billion net LIBOR assets tied to one-month LIBOR right now. So, as that migrates down, that will kind of put in that full effect of that interest rate sensitivity that you saw there. We aren't there yet. It still has room to come down some more, but that will also allow us to push down our deposit costs faster too as LIBOR is coming down as well. And when you look at the money market equivalent, that will all kind of come down together. It will hurt our asset side, but we're going to make it up on the deposit side. You're welcome. Yeah. So, David reported, I think a week or two ago, that the floors that he's putting in range anywhere from, I think, 25 basis points to 75 basis points from a LIBOR perspective. I think those are the floors that he's putting in from that perspective. That's the LIBOR rate, not the spread over it. Welcome. Yeah. For the second quarter, Erika, we are paying a premium to our teammates right now that are on the front line. So, you're going to see an elevated charge in personnel with that. Depending on how quickly we basically can adjust from work at home, that will fade away. We also are actively getting more laptops in, so more people on the call centers can do more of their work at home. So, that will subside as we get more of that equipment in as well that we've accelerated from that perspective.  As far as the implementation of third party and facilities, as they execute and play out, that's when you get the savings. So, you may not see as much early on this year, but as it goes out throughout the year, and as we continue to move, it will start to build, such that the fourth quarter will have a higher annualized impact than what you would see at this point from that perspective. So, a lot of good things, although some of the third-party savings is tied to conversions.  Or just to be transparent, there's some big card conversions coming up, some big conversions coming up in the wealth and broker dealer areas. So, like, right now, in Joe's world, he's planning to still stay on track with an earlier conversion in his broker dealer. I think that's going to be in the first part of 2021. If that stays on track, that might miss a little bit at the end of 2020, but he wasn't supposed to be there at the end of 2020. He's scheduled more for early 2021. But if that plays out, then some of those things will come in at that point in time. So... The other minor point is remember that PPP loans that we're putting on the book have a zero percent risk rate. So, we put $10 billion on from the first round. That's not going to cost us any risk weighted capital.  And then, from a leverage number, even though we're going to fund it ourselves, it's not going to really cost us because we're basically just trading out at 10 basis points balance at the Fed to 100 basis points earning asset from PPP. So, from a capital perspective, those should be fine. Sure. Chris, we don't really have a good estimate on how much forgiveness is going to be out there. If I gave you a number, it would be a pure guess right now. So, I don't really know. Whether it goes out \u2013 my guess is, everybody's making the loans now. So, you've got a big tsunami. Remember, the SBA has to process all these forgivenesses in 60 days. It probably is going to take some time to process all that. So, my guess is it might linger on into three, four, five months before all the forgivenesses are happening, and we'll see how quickly they do that. But then, there will be some and portions of some loans that will stay the full two years. We will accrete the earnings and we're booking them at a discount. The last time I looked at our average discount that we'll put on the books, about 2.7% discount, and that will accrete in. And then, when it pays off for forgiveness, we'll take all that in at that point in time. It plays out to two years and you just earn it over that time period. John, I would just say \u2013 and one noteworthy thing, for the increase for Q1, about 70% of that reserve, that provision increase was related to commercial and about 30% was consumer. I have to look and see on the split between \u2013 I guess we can get back to you on that, John. On the split in the actual allowance itself, we can get you that. Yeah, that's exactly right. So, basically, your book value is lower. So, you apply your reserve against the lower balance. So, it helps you a little bit. But I think of it as its earnings that are coming in. Those earnings can be used to provide for other provision or could fall to the bottom line from an earnings perspective. Yeah, exactly. I think to your first question \u2013 You've got it? Yeah. John, back to your first question, the wholesale reserves for Q1 are about $2.270 billion and the consumer is $2.941 billion. Yeah. We definitely have more absorption, more cushion from that perspective. But also, I think when you just cut \u2013 the bank coming together and the diversification of how we came together, we really don't have any really significant exposures in any of our portfolios because, as we came together, we were much more diversified. And that should play out when the new stress test come out from the Fed later this quarter. Our hope is that we're going to have a really strong PPNR, a really strong loss number and very resilient capital ratio. We should, hopefully, be well under the 250 basis points stress capital buffer."

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call. I certainly hope you and your families are safe and well in the difficult environment we're all living in.  I want to take a minute before we get into the numbers to just talk about culture because I believe, now more than ever, culture matters most of all of the things we can talk about.  So, you've heard us say that our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. This is absolutely a critical time for us to live out that purpose. So, our mission is focusing on our clients, our teammates and our stakeholders \u2013 in that order \u2013 and we do that very, very seriously every day.  Our values are to be trustworthy, caring, operate as one team, focus on success and, ultimately, happiness for our teammates. We're focusing during this environment, number one, on the health and safety of our teammates. We are pleased that about 35,000 of our 58,000 teammates are able to work remotely.  We are spending a lot of time supporting our clients, particularly on the Payroll Protection Program. We're spending a lot of energy and focus supporting our communities through our Truist Cares $25 million philanthropic donations that we did early in the cycle.  I'll tell you that our teammates are working really, really hard. They're working 24/7 in many cases. They're working very, very closely together. It's incredible to see the kind of positive results that we're getting, particularly like in the PPP program where our people were able to stand up literally overnight, an automated portal to allow our clients to access automatically with us in terms of getting their applications in.  Our teammates are bonding faster than we would ever have expected. And I can say to you today that our culture at Truist is really, really strong.  If you're following on the presentation, I'm on slide 5. Just as a reminder, after the combination, we're the sixth largest US commercial bank by assets and market value. We have a very strong, number 2 weighted average deposit market share in the top 20 MSAs. We have 12 million households, 58,000 teammates. We are very well positioned, we think, to achieve our purpose.  We are recognized as one of the highest rated financial institutions, and we're continuing to grow loans and deposits, particularly in this period of flight to quality. Daryl is going to cover a lot of information about our very strong capital and liquidity in just a bit. I would point out that our diversification is a real strength. We are very diversified in products, services and geographies.  On slide 6, we talk about some of the things we're doing with regard to the crisis. Like others, we have been providing payment relief assistance, including forbearance, deferrals, extensions, other ways we can help our clients. We've already done over 300,000 accommodations for consumers, 16,000 for our commercial clients. We've temporarily waived ATM surcharges. And we're uniquely offering a 5% cashback on qualifying card purchases for important basic needs.  We're real pleased that we've been able to continue to allow appointment interventions with our clients in terms of particular needs they have. We're fortunate that 90% of our branches have drive-throughs, so we've been able to keep those branches open in terms of activity.  We've been really focused on the Paycheck Protection Program. Our average loan amount is about 323,000. We've been authorized for 32,000 companies, representing about 1 million employees. And we're expecting funding to be a little more than $10 billion on the first round, and it will likely be more on the second round, if it is in fact approved.  We're providing financial relief programs for small businesses in many other ways also. And we've been able to fund, without hesitation, extensive line draws for our commercial clients.  For our teammates, we've awarded $1,200 coronavirus relief bonuses to about 78% of our teammates making less than $100,000 a year. We've been very aggressive in providing work from home and other alternative work strategies for our teammates to provide safety for them.  We also increased our onsite special rate pay for those that have to be at work in critical roles, with $6.25 special pay for those on hourly and $50 a day for those that are not.  Our Truist Foundation is contributing $4 for every $1 that our Truist teammates donate to our One Team Fund, which helps our teammates that are in financial hardship and need assistance. For our communities, we announced earlier a $25 million philanthropic contribution which has really gone a long way to help. We donated $1 million for each of the CDC Foundation and Johns Hopkins. And our Truist Foundation donated $3 million to local United Way organizations. On page seven, just a few financial highlights. We did have $5.6 billion in taxable-equivalent revenue. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $1.18 billion. Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis was $0.87. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted was 15.5%, which is very strong in this environment. And our adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.4%. So, we feel really good about that.  Our January and February, like a lot of people, were really strong. And then we, of course, ran into all the challenges that we're all experiencing because of COVID-19. Interestingly, insurance and mortgage continued to have strong performance throughout the entire quarter.  Our asset quality, as Clarke will describe to you, is actually very good right now, but we know that's the calm before the storm. And that's why we added a strong $893 million provision in anticipation of the challenges that we know we will face.  We have a tight focus on our teammates and our clients and our communities, which we believe is our job number one right now. If you go to slide 8, just a couple of the unusual items this quarter. We know it's a little messy, but we got the issue of the merger and the COVID impact. While merger-related charges are $107 million before tax, about $0.06 negative impact after tax, the incremental operating expenses, these are ones that provide future benefits, but they're not a part of the ongoing run rate, so we call them out separately, and that's $74 million or $0.04 a share. And then, the COVID impact in terms of cost and foregone revenues is about $71 million or $0.04. So, there really is, in my view, about $0.14 of unusual items, which gets you to the $0.87.  If you go to deck 9, slide 9, in loans and leases, it's been an interesting period. You can see that our first quarter average loans was $301 billion, but by the end of the period, it was $319 billion. Obviously, we had a surge at the end of March. We had about $18 billion in drawdowns. That continued into early part of April. We had another about $1.4 billion. Again, it's kind of subsided. It's been relatively flat since then. We do expect substantial PPP funding. As I said, we have in process about $10 billion in committed loans and we expect will be drawn down relatively soon.  In terms of the market, everybody wants to know what's going to happen. I do too. But the truth is we just don't know. It depends, obviously, on the depth and the length of the health crisis as we work through that, and then how that has the knock-off effect with regard to the economy.  The good news is, going into this, the economy was very strong. The bad news is small business will really struggle to recover from this. Still, I would say to you, Americans are resilient and I believe our country is likely to outperform the worst expectations.  If you look at deposits on page 10, same kind of thing. Average balances were $334 billion. It popped up to $350 billion as we had an increase of $15 billion during that period of time. About $7 billion of that was line draws, but then we also had some seasonal increases and some flight-to-quality deposits that moved in, which we're very pleased to see. Our total average cost of deposits decreased by 6 basis points, which we're very happy to see.  So, let me turn it to Daryl now and let him give you some detail. Thanks, Daryl. So, in terms of the accomplishments \u2013 and keep in mind, we really just merged these two companies in December. So, we've accomplished a lot. Most importantly, we rolled out the Truist culture. We were able to complete 32 townhall meetings. We had a few at the very end that we had to cancel or defer because of COVID-19, but we got through most of the enterprise and the reception to it was extremely good.  We introduced and rolled out the Truist visual identity and logo. We did complete the purchase of Truist Center, which is our corporate headquarters here in Charlotte. We launched our Truist Foundation.  And we were able to go ahead and begin consolidating some redundant real estate portfolios that we had that we could go ahead and begin to get some early cost saves.  So, in terms of the next steps, if you think about it right now, we really have two major priorities. Number one priority is focusing on COVID-19. We're laser focused on taking care of our teammates, making sure everybody's safe and well. We're doing everything we can possibly do to support our clients, not only in terms of their safety, in terms of interaction with us, but also in terms of helping them sustain the economic challenges that are going along with this terrible experience we're all going through. We're trying to be very willing to invest and be creative in terms of how to support our communities, and we're doing some really interesting things there in terms of broadband and all types of things that we can do to help communities that are really, really struggling.  So, the second priority, of course, is keeping the integration and conversion on track. We believe we are in a good place there. It's hard to know exactly what may happen with regard to any delays. It really depends on the depth and the length of the health crisis. But at this point, we still feel good about where we are in terms of our planned conversion and integration activities.  In terms of our performance targets, we still believe in the medium term. We would project a return on tangible common equity in the low 20s, adjusted efficiency in the low 50s. You can see we're already pretty much there. And we're still remaining very confident in terms of our $1.6 billion in net cost saves.  Exactly when we achieve that kind of depends on, obviously, the environment we're living in. If it's a V, then we'll recover pretty quickly and we'll hit these in the not-too-distant medium target type of range. If it's a U, it will take a little bit longer, and that's just pretty obvious.  Regardless, we believe that we will be a top-tier performer, whatever the absolute numbers are. I will say to you that all of the benefits of the merger look better now than they did a year ago.  Finally, if you look at our value proposition slide, we believe we provide a really strong value proposition. We are a purpose-driven company, committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. That's really important, more important than ever in today's world.  We have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets. We have strong market share and vibrant fast-growing MSAs in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and a growing national presence. We have a very comprehensive and diverse business mix in banking, capital markets and insurance.  And very importantly, we are simply better together. We're stronger. We're more resilient. We have best-in-breed in terms of talent, technology, strategy and processes.  We are very uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns, while investing in the future. As I said, we have net $1.6 billion of net cost saves yet to come. These complementary businesses are clearly going to yield substantial revenue increases as we develop the synergies.  Our returns and capital are buoyed by purchase accounting accretion, which Daryl has described to you, and we're making meaningful investments in technology capabilities, our teammates, marketing and advertising. We have a very strong capital and liquidity with resilient risk profile, enhanced by the merger. We are very prudent and disciplined in risk management and financial management. We have a very conservative risk culture, leading credit metrics among the highest-rated large banks.  We have diversification benefits that arise from the merger we discussed. We stress test very, very well \u2013 separately and together. We have a very strong capital and liquidity position and being enhanced even with the flight to quality.  And we have a very defensive and, I would call it, strong and resilient balance sheet supported by purchase accounting marks combined with the CECL credit reserves.  Because of the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity, I would expect us to continue our dividend as we move forward into as far as we can see.  So, like I said in January, if you liked us a year ago, you should love us now, but we continue to believe our best days are ahead. Ryan, I'll turn it back over to you. So, Betsy, keep in mind too that the effects of the Payroll Protection Program will keep people whole in terms of their income. And those that are furloughed, in most cases, as I understand it, their unemployment insurance because there was an increase in the normalized unemployment insurance substantially, in many cases, people have more take home income than they had before. So, it's hard to say exactly today, in the short run, that that would be a huge negative impact. Obviously, if this is extended and the government programs don't provide continued stimulus, then it will be a factor. But in the short run, the government has actually done a pretty good job in terms of providing short-term buffer. Well, all of it is, over term, still achievable. You're right, though some of it may be deferred because of the environment we're in today. Because of more people working away from the office, the connectivity, et cetera, there may be some things that we're not able to do as quickly as we had anticipated. But our people are studying this daily. And as of today, they have not discovered any material issues that will dramatically slow down our progression in terms of integration. And the progression of the integration is what drives call centers. We haven't disclosed that level of detail. I would tell you this that, for each of those segments, we have done detailed analysis, things like risk grade notching and a good bit of sensitivity to the downside. And each and every one of those, we've looked at the modification or deferral request. And so, we've used that to add additional overlays on top of what the models would have driven in. They're considerably higher than the other segments, I will just tell you that. Chris will cover that. Bill, why don't you go ahead and maybe I'll add a comment at the end? And I will just point out one additional point. I said earlier, culture matters always. It really matters in a time like this. A really big part of our culture is just taking care of our teammates. We get that our clients come first, but you can't take care of your clients without doing a really good job for your teammates. So, Truist is unique in terms of having a fully paid for pension plan, 6%-on-6% 401(k) match. And then, we do things like $1,200 bonuses and premium pay for people on the lines. So, all of those things, our teammates really appreciate. And so, they see that, during difficult times, we're going to take care of them even if there's some sacrifice in terms of short-term profitability. We're going to take care of our teammates, so they can feel safe and secure, and then they can help our clients feel safe and secure. Those memories will be here for decades. And so, we feel very good about our culture. As Bill said, it is accelerating and it is strong as steel. So, Erika, just one comment. Daryl, can I add? You're right. You can count, I think, in terms of expenses being bifurcated. There are expenses that are independent of kind of the LIFO effect \u2013 some of our vendor contracts, some are independent of COVID and we've seen substantial reductions in run rate of vendor contracts already and more to come.  With regard to the teammates, there's a one-time big charge we had with regard to the $1,200 bonus, but the ongoing, from this point forward, teammate charges are not marginally incremental.  And in terms of the impact on the conversion, it really depends. But today, our people are functioning very well, working offsite. And keep in mind, in the technology area, we've already \u2013 we've had thousands of people working offsite forever. So, this is not a new idea. It's just more people doing it. And so, as long as they're able to continue to do their scoping and their mapping and their programming remotely, which now we see that they can, it's not self-evident that there will be a dramatic change with regard to our integration and conversion scheduling. So, nobody's thinking about buybacks today. We are in a very strong capital position and are still accreting capital. We still made $1 billion even before adjustments this year \u2013 this quarter. So, we will be steadily moving up unless there are dramatic increases in loan losses, which we would not project at this time. Again, if it's a long U, that makes a difference. We all understand that. So, we have said that our intermediate term target was 10%. We've said we did that because of the uncertainties that we knew about with regard to the merger. We said we were doing it because of uncertainties we didn't know about. We didn't know about COVID, of course. But thank goodness, we did prepare for that. And we're in a really good position. Now, as those uncertainties subside in terms of the merger integration and surely the health crisis will go away and surely the economy will improve, then we have said, and I would reaffirm, we have capital opportunities as we go forward below that 10% level. It will depend on the then existing circumstances, but there are opportunities available for our shareholders. And if you recall, we had made some adjustments with regard to our underwriting standards even pre-COVID. So, we were already anticipating a potential slowdown. We had made adjustments already. And remember that, in all of our portfolios, essentially, the exposure was reduced in half because of the doubling of the denominator. So, it was an automatic diversification that's material in this kind of environment."

            "name": "Christopher Henson",
            "content": "Yeah. This is Chris, John. Thank you for the question. First off, we would expect second quarter to be up about 3%. That's seasonally strong this quarter of the year. And you're right, the slow down as a result of COVID really is creating declining exposure units that could be lost, people, lost business, what have you, and that will slow economic \u2013 new business production. But to your point, there will be a potential pickup in pricing.  When we went into the Great Recession, we went in with the backdrop of a soft insurance market. We go into this one \u2013 it's actually a very strong market on the back of 2017 and 2018 being the two largest [indiscernible] loss years in history. So, we're kind of in the up 4.5%, 5% range right now. If we've got to go into one, that's a good backdrop to have \u2013 if you're going to have it to back. And just for this quarter, for example, rates are up 4.5%. If you throw on top of that lower interest rates, these P&C underwriters are going to be struggling on their investment returns. So, they will likely continue to keep upward pressure on the rate environment. So, I think your intuition is exactly right.  We expect momentum in pricing for the balance of the year. But we do see tough new business reduction. So, we might have been looking at \u2013 this past quarter, we had 7.3% organic growth. Kind of looking forward, it's looking more like maybe in the flat to 2% kind of range for the balance of the year."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Clarke Starnes III",
            "content": "Saul, we assume through a weighted probability of all those scenarios that Daryl described and we did our estimate. We assumed very sharp initial GDP contraction, a spike in unemployment and then lingering high-single digit unemployment for the two-year reasonable supportable period. And our mean reversion was basically similar to what we experienced after the Great Recession.  And so, then we get, to Daryl's point, a good bit of sensitivity analysis around the different stress portfolios. We looked at the historical and projected redefault rates on the different mods and deferrals. And we baked all of that into our qualitative overlay. So, we feel like the estimate today is the best we know. Obviously, if things deteriorate worse, then we would have to provide more. If it holds up as we projected, then we're well reserved. Yeah. Betsy, this is Clarke. On the consumer side, it's about $9 billion. That's for both onUps and Service for Others. So, it's about $8 billion for balance sheet. So, roughly 3%. On the commercial side, it's about roughly $10 billion or so, 5% or 6%. So, again, I would note the far majority of all of our re-agings have been with accounts that are current to start with, even in our subprime auto as an example. So, again, I think this is a very unusual environment. So, you have a lot of people that are worried that have \u2013 maybe have lost their job or maybe have not, but they're worried and they're just all little different than normal, in that most are current to start with. Yeah. And again, if the economy actually underperforms those scenarios, we would have to provide more, but based on what we know today, we think we're well reserved, but we're certainly watching it. This is Clarke. I would say yes to that question. Across all our asset classes, we've done pretty extensive reviews and we have made underwriting and risk acceptance changes as appropriate. You would expect us to do. So, I think we would be more on the conservative end, and they are in place today. We've also worked hard to be very careful about what we call any non-essential lending right now, given the uncertainty.  So, as far as the modification requests, I'd say, from the commercial side, we've had a lot in the stressed industries that we laid out, things like hospitality, et cetera . And then, on the consumer side, it's been predominantly on the mortgage and all those sides right now."

And we just did a survey that was an engagement proxy. And in this incredible environment, the survey actually showed high levels of engagement from our teammates.  In many ways, the cultural integration has been accelerated by months, if not years, because people are operating under stressful conditions. The teamwork has been spectacular. I think, Kelly, you would echo that. No one's wearing a jersey because they're all headed towards the same objective.  So, I think you point out accurately, there are elements of this that are advantageous as we go through this process. And I've personally been just really, really proud of the work that our teammates have done.  The town halls and the rollout of purpose, mission and values, we were well underway there, and that has been a really good catalyst because everybody's got something to lean forward on. They're all speaking the same language and operating from the same playbook."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations for Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead.\nAnkur Vyas: Thank you, Jake. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With us today are our CEO, Bill Rogers, and our CFO, Daryl Bible. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's fourth quarter results and also share perspectives and how we continue to activate Truist purpose, our progress on the merger, and current business conditions. Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair, and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call.  The accompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist IR site, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. In addition, Truist is not responsible for, and does not edit nor guarantee, the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are on our website.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Rogers Jr.: Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining our call. We hope that your new year is off to a good start and that you and your families are doing well.  I'm very pleased with Truist's strong fourth quarter results. Fee income was solid, reflecting our diverse business mix of favorable conditions and investment banking and insurance. Net interest income is starting to improve, exceeding expectations. Credit quality was outstanding, resulting in another provision benefit. We delivered on our expense goals as adjusted non-interest expense decreased almost 4% and drove 3% sequential positive operating leverage. Loan growth, excluding PPP, is strengthening and we have momentum going into this year. I'll share more details on these topics during the presentation.  And turning to slide 4. As always, I'm going to begin with purpose which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We believe our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions.  Our purpose-driven culture is also the foundation for how we attract and retain top talent. People simply want to work for and do business with companies that stand for something meaningful. This culture, combined with our comprehensive compensation and benefit packages, significant and ongoing training development and career mobility and our more flexible approach to work will be our formula for attracting and retaining the best talent at Truist and competing and winning in the ongoing war for talent.  Slide 5 highlights some of the ways we're putting our purpose into action. This slide is organized around the same major themes contained in our CSR and our ESG report since they are topics that are most relevant to all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. I could not be more proud of both the quantity and, most importantly, the quality of the work being done across all these dimensions and the tremendous impact we're having in our communities.  While I can't cover every point on the slide, let me highlight a few. On the technology front, we were excited to welcome our teammates to the recently completed Innovation and Technology Center in Charlotte. I look forward to our external grand opening in the first half of the year.  As you know, Truist has an unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. And I'm very pleased to report that we recently achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles to at least 15%. This was a year earlier than our original commitment. While we're proud to have achieved this milestone, we acknowledge that this is actually the beginning and not the end.  We've also intentionally implemented a flexible work strategy for our teammates, which includes onsite, remote and hybrid options. Hybrid and more flexible work is here to stay. And I've learned the meaning and the power of intentional flexibility, the concept of people coming together as a team, whether in the office or not, and intentionally deciding what works best for them, their team, our clients and the company, while remaining highly engaged and, most importantly, purposeful.  Finally, we released our inaugural TCFD report in mid-December, which adds further context and disclosures to our previous CSR and ESG reports. At Truist, we view all the elements of ESG as an opportunity to improve our company and operationalize our purpose, including climate change. For instance, we're adding new teammates within CIB and our commercial community bank who are going to help our clients transition to a lower carbon economy.  Now, turning to slide 7, this quarter, we had $163 million of after-tax, merger related and restructuring charges and $165 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The total EPS impact of merger-related costs was $0.25 a share.  While our decision to create a best of both model of integration has resulted in increased upfront cost, I firmly believe it creates the best platform for future investment and growth. The good news is that total merger costs will be cut approximately in half in 2022 compared to last year and then fall out of our expense base entirely after this year.  Now turning to our fourth quarter performance on slide 8. As I indicated, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year as most areas were generally in line or somewhat ahead of our expectations. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.13 earnings per share for the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding the merger impacts on the prior slide, we earned $1.9 billion or $1.38 per share. Primary driver of changes in EPS relative to both the prior quarter and the year ago was the loan loss provision, given the rapidly evolving economic environment over the past two years.  We generated strong returns, including 22.6% adjusted ROTCE, which was unchanged from last quarter. Excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still a very strong 19.6%.  Asset quality continues to be an excellent story and net charge-offs were in line with our guidance. Capital deployment was robust during the fourth quarter as we funded strong organic loan growth, closed the service finance acquisition in early December and repurchased $500 million worth of common stock. We'll provide more details about loan growth momentarily.  On the merger integration front, we completed the first part of the core bank conversion in mid-October by migrating our heritage BB&T clients to the Truist ecosystem. As part of the conversion, we launched the new truist.com as well as our digital commerce account opening platform. Since then, our integration teams have completed two successful dress rehearsals for a final conversion, one in mid-December and one just this past weekend. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and dedication to this effort. Because of them, we're on track for the final core conversion in February, during which our heritage SunTrust clients will be migrated to the Truist ecosystem. Looking at full-year 2021, Truist had a productive year across multiple dimensions. From a financial perspective, we generated significant adjusted net income of $7.5 billion or $5.53 per share and had an adjusted ROTCE of 22%.  While our earnings undoubtedly benefited from a $3 billion lower loan loss provision due to the improving economy, we also demonstrated the strength of our diverse business mix. Fee income, excluding security gains, increased a very strong 10% as we were firing on multiple cylinders. This performance helped offset a 45% decline in mortgage fee income and a 6% decrease in net interest income.  We also continued to deliver on our cost save programs, evidenced by adjusted expenses increasing only 1% during the year, which saw much larger increases in fee income. We also experienced a reduction in our risk profile due to the improving economy and merger integration progress, which enabled us to reduce the CET1 target by 25 basis points to 9.75 and deploy significantly more capital.  Overall, we were able to make great progress on multiple fronts despite continued headwinds from the pandemic, while delivering improved financial performance for our shareholders.  Now turning to slide 10. Our new Truist digital experience reflects two of our core digital and technology principles, co-creation with our clients and moving fast in order to learn fast.  Our more modern and agile platform allows us to incorporate this feedback quickly, the results of which can be seen in the significant improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores, as well as in our Apple App Store and Google Play store ratings in just a few short months. We've now migrated approximately 9 million retail, wealth and small business clients to the Truist digital experience through December, more than 85% of active clients have begun to use the new digital platform in lieu of their heritage app.  On slide 11, you'll see a visual of our new corporate and commercial digital platform, which we'll call a Truist One View. This platform will provide our clients with a comprehensive view of their existing treasury management and lending solutions via streamlined and client-specific experience designed to reduce the time required to perform routine financial task. Including the launch of Truist One View to our commercial clients, Truist has introduced new web and mobile platforms for each of our client segments across retail, wealth, business and corporate. More than 2,000 features were released across these platforms in 2021, and we've done this at a pace that neither heritage company could have achieved on their own.  More broadly, as you can see from the charts on the left, we continue to position ourselves to serve the robust demand for digital services. Digital lending, mobile check deposits, and Zelle transactions all exhibited double-digit growth during the year.  We feel good about our current digital performance, and we believe that our progress will accelerate after the final core bank conversion, in part due to the advantages and efficiencies associated with having one website, one search engine optimization process, one brand, one system, and one digital application, but also in part due to the new capabilities that we'll be able to introduce this year, including our new AI-driven insights tool, our new Truist virtual assistant, and the Truist Developer Center, which will position us to innovate and collaborate with the developer community. Having our teams focus on the new Truist experience versus managing three separate experiences will provide a significant productivity lift as we move forward.  Lastly, we have plans to make strong digital progress in other areas this year from our new partnership and integration with AutoFi, enhancing our InsurTech capabilities via integrating insurance directly into our mortgage process, and launching a new deposit product with LightStream on a real-time cloud-based core.  Now, turning the loans and leases on slide 12. Average loans stabilized after decreasing for five consecutive quarters, and peeling back the onion reveals positive and improving underlying trends. Excluding PPP, average loans increased approximately 1% sequentially and end of period loans grew approximately 2%, reflecting momentum late in the quarter.  The most notable improvement was in C&I where end-of-period balances, excluding PPP, grew $6.3 billion or 5%, reflecting broad-based growth across corporate and commercial lines of business. This was the strongest point-to-point C&I loan growth since the first quarter of 2020. Most CIB, industry and product groups demonstrated growth, most notably within our asset finance group. Broad-based growth was also evident within our commercial community bank where 12 of the 21 regions grew C&I loans excluding PPP during the quarter and we continue to see the most growth in markets that are relatively more open. Every single one of our industry specialty groups within CCB grew, a strong reflection of how our clients value industry expertise and advice.  Revolver utilization also ticked up after six straight quarters of declines. And equally important, total revolver exposure continues to grow, evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion.  Residential mortgage continues to grow, reflecting slower prepayment speeds, our decision to balance sheet certain correspondent production, and increase capacity post conversions and COVID. Excluding mortgage, consumer balances decreased slightly, primarily due to seasonality in our Sheffield business and continued declines in our government guaranteed student loan portfolio.  Service finance closed on December 6, and we feel great about their trajectory heading into 2022. In addition, some of the areas that have been headwinds like dealer floorplan and CRE are beginning to stabilize.  Overall, corporate commercial clients remain optimistic despite ongoing labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. We're encouraged by the momentum we observed in the fourth quarter, but also on our pipelines, which are the highest they've been in some time. We continue to believe there's meaningful upside to the C&I growth story as the economy continues to improve, although the timing remains imprecise.  We also continue to feel confident in our consumer trajectory as we're well positioned with respect to faster growing segments through our digital and point-of-sale businesses, which will offset headwinds in other areas.  Now turning to deposit fund, slide 13. Average deposits increased $8.2 billion or 2% compared to the third quarter, largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus and seasonality related to public funds.  We've also been able to help our clients along their financial journey through our industry-leading child tax credit awareness initiative. Through this initiative, which promotes savings and financial confidence, clients and communities most in need were able to grow their savings and IRA balances by 9% and 15% respectively from May through December. I think this is a great example of what we call purposeful growth.  But we know we can do more, and thus guided by our purpose, we have been reinventing a new checking account experience that aligns with our clients' needs, which we believe will provide them more flexibility, lower cost and more financial confidence.  Truist One Banking will be our new flagship, differentiated and disruptive suite of checking solutions that redefine everyday banking and accelerate our journey towards purposeful growth.  Truist One will have zero overdraft fees. The capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need via a simple $100 negative balance buffer, as well as a deposit based credit line limit of up to $750. These features will help clients manage their liquidity needs far more cost effectively than alternative products. You're going to learn more about these details right after this call. These solutions will be available to all clients this summer, given our need to first finish the conversion. In addition, Truist will discontinue overdraft protection, negative account balance and return item fees in the coming months for all existing accounts.  Long term, this is a win-win for all of our stakeholders as we'll increase client acquisition, particularly next gen clients, enhanced deposit growth and simply improve the overall client experience.  In the near term, however, there will be a financial cost, both as a result of the introduction of Truist One and the reduction of other fees. We expect these changes collectively to result in an approximately $300 million or almost 60% reduction in overdraft-related revenue by 2024. The impact will begin in a few months and build over time as more clients benefit from the Truist One experience.  I'm now going to turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in more detail.\nDaryl Bible : Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 14. Net interest income was up slightly versus the prior quarter and ahead of our guidance of down 1%. The increase was primarily driven by larger securities portfolio as a result of ongoing deposit growth, which offset the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion. Net interest margin and core net interest margin performed in line with our guidance.  Reported net interest margin declined 5 basis points, 2 basis points due to purchase accounting accretion and 3 basis points from core. The main drivers of the 3 basis point decline in core net interest margin were the impacts of lower PPP revenue and higher levels of liquidity. The PPP continues to wind down and we expect to earn an additional $60 million of PPP revenue over the coming two quarters.  Moving to slide 15. Overall, Truist intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, enhancing current earnings while being positioned to take advantage of higher rates both at the short and long ends of the curve. We estimate 100 basis point ramp increase in rates would increase NII by 5%, 100 basis points shock would increase NII by 10%. Approximately 75% of this reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve.  As a rule of thumb, one 25 basis point Fed hike with a 25% beta would increase net interest income by $25 million per month and increase net interest margin 6 basis points, all else being equal.  Moving to slide 16. Reported fees were down 2% from last quarter, largely due to changes in our non-qualified plan. Absent the impacts of the non-qualified plan, fees performed well and were consistent with our guidance of relatively stable.  The driving factors of the stable performance quarter-over-quarter were investment banking and trading increased $61 million versus the prior quarter due to higher syndication fees, structured real estate and record M&A results; insurance income increased $21 million, primarily due to organic growth and seasonal improvements from the third to fourth quarter. These quarterly increases were offset by decline in other income of $107 million or $70 million excluding changes in the non-qualified plan, largely driven by the valuation adjustment for the Visa-related derivative and lower revenue from our SBIC funds. For the full-year 2021, excluding security gains, fees were up 10% versus the prior year or more than $800 million, propelled by our diverse business model, favorable market conditions and Truist's increasing size, scale and relevance across multiple businesses. We are also making good progress early in our IRM initiative, particularly between the connectivity between CCB, wealth and CIB.  Insurance income increased 20% year-over-year, primarily driven by a very strong organic growth of 11% and acquisitions. This was our 99th year of insurance business, our best one yet, and we believe that 2022, our 100th year, can be even better.  Investment banking and trading was also up over $400 million, largely due to record performances of syndicated finance, M&A, equity, structured real estate and asset securitization. M&A revenue doubled relative to 2020 and the lead syndication roles in syndicated finance were up 26% year-over-year, both reflecting our strategic relevance to our clients.  On the flip side, residential mortgage income was down year-over-year $445 million or 45%, primarily due to a sharp decline on gain on sale margins and lower refinance activity.  Turning to slide 17. Reported expenses were $3.7 billion for the quarter, including $212 million of merger-related costs and $215 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Adjusted expenses decreased 3.9% sequentially, at the  end of our guidance of down 3% to 4%. Drivers for the decline include decreased personnel costs, which were a result of lower salary expenses, lower incentive costs, lower medical claims and changes in the non-qualified plan. Average FTEs declined 3%, including service finance from the prior quarter.  Adjusted expenses also declined due to elevated equipment and marketing expenses in the third quarter. Full-year adjusted expenses were up only 1% despite the adjusted fee income growing 10% year-over-year. This limited increase demonstrates the cost saving success we have achieved throughout the year and our overall discipline on expense management.  Moving to slide 18. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio, the favorable economic conditions and the effects of stimulus.  Our net charge-off ratio increased to 25 basis points from 19 basis points in the third quarter due to seasonality in the consumer losses and lesser commercial recoveries. ALLL coverage ratio decreased to 1.53%, which is just below our CECL day one levels, resulting in a provision benefit of $103 million in the fourth quarter as the economic scenarios continue to improve.  Continuing on slide 19. Capital and liquidity levels remained very strong. Our CET1 ratio declined from 10.1% to 9.6%, driven by organic loan growth, share repurchases and the service finance acquisition. Our established near-term target for CET1 of 9.75% has not changed, although the ratio declined to 9.6% in the fourth quarter. We anticipate being somewhat below our 9.75% CET1 target in the near term, given the improving loan growth outlook and the CECL phase-in for the first quarter.  We also do not anticipate repurchasing any shares for the first half of 2022.  Moving to slide 21. We achieved major milestone in October with the successful migration of our BB&T retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem. We have three significant integration milestones remaining, completing the Truist Digital First migration, finalizing the remaining branch consolidations in the first quarter, and the migration of our SunTrust retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem, which will occur in February.  The visual culmination of this process will be 6,000 more Truist signs across our markets at branches, ATMs, retail and corporate offices, finally allowing us to serve as one brand for our clients. Once the integration is complete and all the systems have been converted, Truist will be a much simpler company to operate, allowing us to provide even better service to our clients.  Turning to slide 22. We continue to be committed to achieving our $1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress in each of the five categories. Third-party spend is down 11.5% from baseline levels, exceeding our targeted reduction of 10%. Our sourcing team continues to make great strides in achieving savings despite the impacts of inflation. And the good news is there are fewer contracts to renegotiate in 2022 due to the higher volume of contracts renegotiated during Truist's first two years. We are on track to deliver over 800 total branch closures by the first quarter of 2022. And we are about 90% of the way towards our non-branch facility reduction target.  Average FTEs are down 11% since the merger excluding acquisitions. Additionally, technology savings were materialized after redundant systems are decommissioned in the second half of 2022.  Turning to slide 23. Core non-interest expense was $2.94 billion in the fourth quarter, meeting our target for the quarter. As a reminder, core non-interest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time the merger closed. Going forward, we will focus primarily on adjusted expenses, and not core, as adjusted expenses represent what we believe will be the run rate going forward.  I will now provide guidance for the full-year 2022 and for the first quarter. In 2022, we expect total revenue to grow 2% to 4% from 2021 as a result of higher net interest income, combined with solid growth in fees. The lower end of the range reflects two Fed hikes, with one in June and the second in December, while the upper end reflects 3 to 4 rate hikes throughout the year. This guidance includes the initial financial impact from the new Truist One account and related fee reductions in 2022.  Adjusted non-interest expense is expected to only increase 1% to 2% in 2022 as a result of inflation, increased investments and expenses from acquisition in 2021, partially offset by the ongoing cost savings, including achieving our final cost save target in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Merger-related and restructuring costs and incremental operating expenses related to the merger are anticipated to be approximately $800 million in 2022, with these expenses going away in 2023.  Given these factors, we anticipate positive operating leverage on both a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2022. This is the primary metric we will hold ourselves accountable to this year.  We also expect net charge-offs ratio to be between 30 basis points and 40 basis points in 2022, given favorable economic conditions and the assumptions for normalization throughout the year, with some quarter-to-quarter variability. Excluding discrete items, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and 21% if you model us on a taxable equivalent basis.  Looking into the first quarter, we expect total revenues to decline approximately 1% to 2% from fourth quarter levels. Given two fewer days, lower purchase accounting accretion and PPP revenue, continued pressures on mortgage and the typical seasonal patterns in certain fee categories like payments and service charges. This will be partially offset by seasonality and insurance.  Reported net interest margin should be down a couple of basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion, although expect core to be relatively flat. We expect adjusted expenses to increase 1% to 2% next quarter from the fourth quarter levels, partially due to the seasonality and personnel expense, given FICA and 401(k) and partially due to higher marketing expense as we continue to roll out the Truist brand post conversions.  Now I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude.\nWilliam Rogers Jr. : Thank you, Daryl. Slide 24 is our investment thesis which is built on four pillars or themes that we believe truly differentiate Truist and allow us to inspire and build better lives and communities as well as deliver purposeful growth for all of our stakeholders. I also think it's the same reason I've got the best job in banking. I shared color on this refreshed investment thesis with many of you in December.  So, on slide 25 and in summary and conclusion, Truist had a very good 2021, highlighted by improved financial performance, strong fee income from our diverse business model, significant capital deployment and strong risk management as evidenced by our excellent asset quality metrics. We also made substantial integration progress, taking many significant steps towards becoming One Truist.  As we look into 2022, our formula is going to be simple. First, we'll complete the merger in the first quarter, eliminate merger related costs by year-end and achieve our cost saves, all of which will help us produce positive operating leverage.  Second, we'll begin to pivot from an integration focus to an operating focus on executional excellence and growth. The momentum we have going into 2022, combined with being One Truist across all dimensions \u2013 technology, digital, brand, products, process \u2013 gives me great confidence in our performance and potential as we make and complete this pivot.  Lastly, we'll have the capacity to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders as integration risks subside and the economy stays on sound footing.  So with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur for Q&A.\nAnkur Vyas : Thanks, Bill. Jake, at this time, if you'll explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.\nOperator: . And we will begin with Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken, are you there? You might be muted. We're not hearing anything from Ken. We'll move to the next caller in the queue. Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: I was hoping to follow up on the expense guidance of 1% to 2% growth on an adjusted basis. There's obviously some puts and takes with the cost saves and the service finance. What are you thinking about underlying expense growth? I think, Daryl, you had talked about 3%. back in November. Is that still true? Or how do we think about that?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah, Matt. I think we were at the conference in the fourth quarter, we said we would have around 3% inflation. That's about $400 million. That's what we're ballparking for us for next year. We have the benefit, obviously, of having our third tranche of cost saves coming through in 2022, which really makes the adjusted expense growth pretty moderate versus not having those cost saves.\nMatt O'Connor: Just remind us the lift from service finance on the cost side starting in 1Q?\nDaryl Bible: About $20 million a quarter.\nOperator: John Pancari with Evercore ISI. \nJohn Pancari: On your revenue guide of 2% to 4%, maybe could you just help us think about how that would break down. If you can unpack that by managers income versus fees, maybe give us a little bit of color how we should think about growth in 2022 on those fronts. \nDaryl Bible: If you looked at my prepared remarks, we talk about net interest income. We really right now have in our base forecast only two Fed increases, one in June and one in December. That's the lower end of the revenue guide. Obviously, if you look at the forwards markets where they are today, it's I think 3.8 times, so almost four Fed moves factored in. That would get us to the higher end of the curve. We gave you a couple of metrics. We're using a 25% beta in our rate sensitivity. And that 25% beta equates to about $25 million per month for every Fed increase that we have there. If you look back historically and look back at the recession that we had when Fed started to raise rates in 2015 and 2016, the betas for the first 100 basis points were 15%. And we're modeling 25%. So I think we're a little bit conservative on that side. We'll see how things play out. We are modeling a higher beta when you go up over 100 basis points. So, the next 100, we're at 35. And then anything over 35, we're at a 50% beta. It's kind of the assumptions we're using.  On the fee side, we feel pretty  growth on the fee side. We had momentum there. We had a tremendous year in 2021. We still think we'll continue to have pretty good pull through of revenue, with the exception of mortgage just because of lower spreads and volumes.\nWilliam Rogers Jr.: John, the simplest way to think about it is the 2% sort of assumes a flattish kind of NII. And the upside of the 2% to 4% is in the NII. And then the balance of the growth is non-interest income. \nJohn Pancari: Separately, on the loan growth. side, I wonder if you can give us just expectations how we should think about the pace of growth in 2022 and maybe also for that as well how that would break down in terms of commercial versus consumer trends. \nWilliam Rogers Jr.: John, maybe I'll do a little sort of where we are and what the jumping off point is to put a little put a little context around that. As you well know, loan growth is a function of production utilization, pay downs, and pipelines is the way that I like to think about the about the formula in its most simple way. And as we finished the fourth quarter, we really saw the production start to increase, utilization was up about 2.5 points, which was \u2013 that's the first time we've seen a swing in the utilization front. And that was pretty universal. So, we felt good about that from a momentum standpoint. Paydowns were up a little bit, but maybe most importantly, is the pipelines were at really, really high levels. So, our CCB pipeline, our CIB pipeline and our CRE pipelines all were at historically sort of high levels compared to the quarter and compared to this time last year. Usually, this time of year, you're starting to clean out pipelines and sort of trying to refresh in the first quarter. So, we enter this with a little more confidence and momentum than maybe we have in the past. On the consumer side, we have some headwinds from student loan, but that was really just left purchases available. So, I think that's sort of a little bit of a conscious kind of decision. And then home equity, which I think just is a symbol of sort of how people want to borrow in the future, but remember, things like service finance are coming on. So, we completed that purchase in early December. So we'll sort of get the benefit of that on the consumer side as we come through.  So, in terms of thinking about the whole year and thinking about puts and takes, I think sort of a mid-single digit from here kind of growth rate based upon everything we know now, nothing else changing, so on and so forth, I think is sort of eminently achievable, and I think reflective of the momentum we have right now.\nOperator: We have Ken Usdin with Jefferies back in the queue.\nKen Usdin: Just wanted to come back on that expense trajectory and how you kind of take us from here to there. I heard the points about the 1% to 2% underlying growth off the end of the year. But you still said you're on track to get the full cost saves? Can you kind of talk us through, after the conversion, when do you get to that run rate numbers? Is it still the fourth quarter? And any update that you might have in terms of just that gross versus net and if you're doing any better on either side versus your original expectations. \nDaryl Bible: Ken, as I said before, our trajectory on expenses is not just down every quarter, it moves up and down. Obviously, we've got some seasonal factors going from fourth to first with FICA and 401(k). And then, we are building our marketing budget and basically rolling out our Truist brand across the whole footprint pretty aggressively to build brand awareness.  I think as the quarter and years play out, I think you're going to see expenses maybe pick up a little bit. And then,. as we get through all the technology decommissioning, that's probably the biggest cost saves to still come through. That's really back end loaded right now. We still have 400 branches that will go away early in the quarter. But for the most part, other real estate and technology savings are probably the biggest savings, which will be towards the end of the quarter. And we feel really good about still hitting our target that we originally set when we announced the merger. \nWilliam Rogers Jr.: One other point I'd add. I think Daryl was making this earlier. This also covers the investments that we're making. So, we have this unique opportunity, in that we've got cost saves out of us, but the ability to cover not only the inflation pressures, but also our investments in talent, our investment in technology, the ability to grow our businesses, that's all factored into this guidance. \nDaryl Bible: If you look at the investments we're making this quarter versus last year, it's probably double what it was. So, we're actually investing more in the company and still achieving our cost saves. \nKen Usdin: Just a second question. You talked about insurance being better this year. The Jan 1 renewals were 10%, 11%. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand what the growth outlook is for the insurance business given the mid-year acquisitions you had in addition to the organic growth outlook. \nWilliam Rogers Jr.: Ken, if it's okay, I'm going to let John sort of hit that directly. \nJohn Howard: I'd say that the environment for insurance continues to be favorable. So, when you think about it from a pricing standpoint, you mentioned the Jan 1 renewals, those were largely around reinsurance pricing and they vary by class of business, but it remains a favorable environment for insurance pricing. We continue to see exposure growth. We continue to see very strong statistics in new business and retention. So, we expect strong performance in insurance in 2022.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. \nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us \u2013 obviously, your CET1 ratio, you lowered the near-term targeted ratio to 9.75% from 10%. What is the longer term once the integration is completed, we're in 2023, heading out further. What do you guys think is a long-term CET1 ratio for you folks? \nDaryl Bible: Gerard, I think as we've said before, we're going to continue to look at sort of where we are in our merger integration, where the economy is, the health of our business and make those adjustments on an ongoing basis. And this won't be a quarterly kind of thing, but just as we see significant shifts in those criteria, evidenced by the fact we went from 10% to 9.75%, and also the fact we've got flexibility. The good news was we had loan growth at the end of the quarter that probably exceeded our expectations and that took our CET1 a little below that target, which we think is great. By the way, that's the sort of high class way to go below that target.  So, as we go through the process this year, we go through the CCAR process, look at all the stress testing results, I think sometimes toward the middle or the end part of this year, we'll take another harder look and be more communicative about where another goal might be.\nGerard Cassidy: As a follow up, I'm trying to figure out, on the fourth quarter of call for 2022 next January, what's going to be the real subject of discussions for you folks and maybe your peers? Obviously, we're not going to be talking about restructuring costs and things like that because it will be finally over for you, folks. But credit is something that I'm wondering about because it's so good today. We all know that. And I don't know if Clarke can comment on this, but I'm curious, when you look at your underwriting standards today \u2013 I don't know if you want to use a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very conservative, 1 being very aggressive \u2013 where does it stand versus where it was at the start of the pandemic? And then where it was versus 2019?  And then second, what's going on with your competition? Are they being really aggressive? Are you guys seem really aggressive underwriting from some of your peers? \nClarke Starnes III: I would say, for Truist, we've removed all our COVID-related overlays that we added in from an underwriting standpoint as the pandemic hit. So, I would say we are underwriting more or less at a normal through the cycle rate. So, right in the middle of the field. We're not on the aggressive and we're not on the conservative end. I think we're meeting the market through our long-term approach. Obviously, it's very competitive out there. There are aggressive structures and pricing considerations that we have to deal with every day. But I think our view is that, because of our diverse business model, particularly in our lending segments, we can get responsible growth through the cycle approach. So, I would say for us, we're in a pretty normal approach, albeit watching those areas that might have been impacted structurally by the pandemic \u2013 CRE, office, things like that. But otherwise, for us, it's more normal underwriting. \nOperator: Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities has the next question. \nMike Mayo: Just a specific question as relates to competition. What's been the retention rate of your employees, customers' deposits? When the merger was announced three years ago, there was a lot of talk about competitors gaining share. And I'm just wondering what specific metrics you have around that.\nWilliam Rogers Jr.: I'll take a crack at that. Obviously, that's an extremely high focus area for us. If we start with deposit and client side, I would say it's been exceptional and exceeded our expectations. The branch closures, retention numbers have been really in the high, high 90s. I think it's just a reflection of clients' confidence in us, our presence in the market and our ability to handle their needs, whether it's digital or whether it's physical. So, that part has been exceptional, exceeded probably all expectations.  And the same thing we see it in the deposit growth. Those are hard numbers, look at market share, but I feel like we're taking share in that sense, in that retention model. As it moves to teammates, I think you and I have talked about this. Right into the first year of the merger, our retention numbers were actually higher for Truist compared to each heritage company. So our teammates had voted for the merger and wanting to be part of that. And we look at not only overall with retention, we look high performer retention. We divide it up a lot of different ways. Obviously, that attrition has picked up. And that's picked up across the industry. I still think on a relative basis, we look really strong from that standpoint.  And if you think about what's going to happen to us, we also changed the denominator a bit when we closed a lot of branches and we're still consolidating. So, our ability, I think, to stay ahead of the attrition game, I think we're really, really well positioned from that standpoint.  But also, and maybe equally importantly, is our attractiveness to hire talent has never been better. We are bringing in some fantastic people that want to be part of our company. They've bought into our purpose. They love the idea of being on a strong legacy company that feels like a startup. So, it's got sort of a nice combination to it. Our commitment and capacity to innovate, make investments has been really attractive. So our attrition numbers are up. There's no doubt about that in the last year. Everybody else's is. I think on a relative basis, we're okay. We manage it to an absolute, though. That's the way I think about it. And our ability to attract talents, really, really strong. Never been stronger.\nMike Mayo: As far as the follow-up, I'm going to have a wind up to my second question here. It's been almost three years since you announced the merger. Your stock is up 39%. The bank index is up 52%. The S&P is up 71%. So, you have woefully underperformed from a stock standpoint. And that coincides with a period when you've shown some negative operating leverage, especially last year. And you've talked about this, the pandemic slowed down the merger conversions, NII has been depressed, you've had a cautious approach, you want the best of breed. And so, we have all that. So, really, I'm getting to positive operating leverage this year, you're doubling the investment. But I just want to know if we can have additional reassurance that operating leverage will be more positive than, say, 1 basis point because you say 2% to 4% revenue growth, 1% to 2% expense growth. So that could be anywhere from 1 basis point to 300 basis points. And this merger was predicated on overlapping footprints, benefits of technology. It seems like you're spending a lot of the savings and investors aren't seeing that to the bottom line. So can you just give any assurance or maybe not as far as the positive operating leverage this year and the payback from these investments, while, as you say, that the hood is open?\nWilliam Rogers Jr.: I think the commitment to positive operating leverage is clear in our guidance. Related to how much we achieved, I think given we've had a pretty conservative forecast on the rate increases, if we get additional rate increases, this was predicated \u2013 the 1% in your lineup was predicated on two rate increases. If we get more, those sort of follow straight through to the bottom line. So, we create more operating leverage.  But I also think, the point I made earlier, we're continuing to invest in this business. We're not going to achieve positive operating leverage and starve our business. The ability to achieve the cost saves, redeploy them into the appropriate investments for the long term, that was the vision of Truist. That was the premise upon which we established this merger.  And I think, arguably, and it'd be hard to dispute, it's taken a little bit longer. Some of those were decisions we made, the best of both was a little more expensive than we had anticipated at the outset. But I think you're really starting to see, and I can feel, you can feel it in the pivot in the fourth quarter, you can feel it in the pivot in our guidance, of the promise of Truist is manifesting itself in not only positive operating leverage, but purposeful growth and an ability to invest in the business for the long term.  So, yes, we're committed to positive operating leverage, underlined, exclamation point and all the other comments, but in a way that we're continuing to invest to grow our business for the long term. \nDaryl Bible: The only thing else I want to add to that, if you look at our net interest income, just to remind you, we have run off of purchase accounting accretion of about $400 million planned for year-over-year. And we have about $325 million run off of PPP planned to be lower year-over-year.  So, for us, just to be flat in NII, 6.5%, the guidance that we gave for revenue growth has net interest income being up maybe a little bit, maybe 1% on a GAAP basis, but that's really 8% if you look at the real true operations of the company and potentially up to maybe 10% if we get rate increases and maybe some more loan growth. So, the company is really performing at high levels from a production basis on the amount of volume that we're putting through on the asset side of the equation.\nOperator: We'll now hear from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Bill, I wanted to ask you a little bit more of an industry question. With the loan demand and loan growth numbers looking better across the industry, what's happening in the psychology of the borrower here? Feels like there's still a lot of liquidity out there, but there's a change going on. Is it more competence about the economy? Folks just have run into a need to build inventories. Why are we seeing this increase in loan demand across the industry?\nWilliam Rogers Jr.: I think it's a combination of things, John. When I'm out visiting with clients, demand is never the issue for business. They all have demand. And that cuts across actually a wide swath of industries and geographic locations. So, the ability to do business.  I think you're seeing a couple things. One is, I think what your premise was, and your question, people building a little inventory, sort of anticipating, trying to get ahead some of the supply chain, I think you see that. Then you just see stuff happening, like in the dealer side, cars are showing up on lots. They may be showing up on lots needing a chip, or whatever it may be, but they're showing up. So the ability to borrow against those capacities. And then, I think people are just making the decisions to move forward. Deploying capital, they've had plans. If they've delayed plans, they're continuing to look at the current Omicron as potentially a short term situation that reverses itself, and they don't want to get behind. They're all in competitive situations. So, I think they're deploying capital against the opportunities that they've had planned for the several years. So I think it's a combination of a lot of things, just resiliency of the economy and a little bit of positioning to get one step ahead of both supply chains, wage pressure, whatever it may be and the competition.\nJohn McDonald: Just follow-up for Daryl on the revenue outlook for this year. The first, how much of that $300 million impact from the Truist One and overdraft, how much of that gets felt in 2022, Daryl? And then also, just on the overall revenue guide, can you just give us the base for the 2021 revenues, that $22.5 billion or something like that for this year that you're growing 2% to 4% off of?\nDaryl Bible: I'll do your latter question first. So, the base for 2021 revenue is $22.3 billion, is kind of base I would grow off of. And then, for the Truist One, recall in Bill's remarks, it's probably going to start in the second quarter. And it's probably anywhere from a third to 40% of the impact would be in 2022 and probably spread out evenly over second, third and fourth quarter, and then kind of builds up in '23 and then the full run rate in '24 of $300 million.\nOperator: Next up, we have Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. \nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess I just wanted to follow-up, Daryl, on your comments around operating leverage. I think the promise of the deal partly was the benefit of scale. As we look beyond this year, just structurally, when we look at the efficiency ratio, I think about 55%, 56% right now, do you see the bank actually being a low 50s efficiency ratio franchise over the next two to four years? Or given the investment spend that you've talked about, it's going to be hard to make that move, absent meaningfully higher interest rate backdrop?\nDaryl Bible: It's a good question. And to the latter part of your question, there is some normalization of rate dependency to get to that lower efficiency ratio. And we won't make as much move on that in the next year, but our efficiency ratio on a relative basis, I think, will continue to be industry leading. So I think the ability to invest in our business, do it in a way that, to your points of scale, achieves a much more efficient company. I think we'll be able to continue that progress.  And then, if we get some sort of normalization of rates, I think looking out over a two and three year period, I think the low 50s is a reasonable target in a normalized kind of right environment. \nWilliam Rogers Jr.: The thing I would add, Ebrahim, and what I said on Mike's call, the run-off of the purchase accounting accretion gets easier year after year. So, the ability to drive positive operating leverage will get easier as we go out two, three, four years.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess on the revenue side, with the systems conversion done, my sense would be, given your scale, given your history in these markets, you should be playing offense where you gain market share. So, Bill, you shared some retention numbers. But talk to us about your ability to go head to head with regionals, smaller banks, and actually gain market share, as we think about the next few years and probably outperform on loan growth.\nWilliam Rogers Jr.: Maybe just to clarify the first part of your question, we've been on offense. I think it's just an ability to be further on offense and to accentuate that capability. If you look at virtually all of our categories, if you think about insurance, as an example, relative to insurance, if you think about our investment banking relative to investment banking, if you think about deposit growth, loan growth, client acquisition, digital adoption, whatever measures you want to choose on a relative basis, I feel like we're already gaining share. And I think, to your point, our capacity to gain share, our competitiveness, the breadth and depth of our product capability, the talent that we have on the field, the training that they're receiving, the way they work together and integrated relationship management, the way that they allow all cylinders of the company to benefit the client, we've just never been more competitive against small, against regional, against large. I think all the things that we wanted to see and feel from Truist are absolutely coming to bear on the field every day.\nAnkur Vyas: Jake, we've got time for one more question. \nOperator: And we will take that last question from Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian: I'll be quick. Daryl, your outlook for adjusted expense growth, I presume that's from the $12.687 billion base? And if so, what is the outlook for amortization expense in 2022, please?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah, so the base is correct. What you said was right, Erika. And then, if you look in our tables in the back of the appendix, we actually gave guidance around that out there. So you'll be able to easily kind of fill in your models with all that information. So, it'll make it easy for you.\nErika Najarian: And the positive operating leverage guide, does that include the amortization?\nDaryl Bible: No, we always exclude amortization. It's in the footnote definition.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks. \nAnkur Vyas : That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you all for your interest in Truist and attending our call. We hope you have a great day. Jake, you can now disconnect. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 14. Net interest income was up slightly versus the prior quarter and ahead of our guidance of down 1%. The increase was primarily driven by larger securities portfolio as a result of ongoing deposit growth, which offset the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion. Net interest margin and core net interest margin performed in line with our guidance.  Reported net interest margin declined 5 basis points, 2 basis points due to purchase accounting accretion and 3 basis points from core. The main drivers of the 3 basis point decline in core net interest margin were the impacts of lower PPP revenue and higher levels of liquidity. The PPP continues to wind down and we expect to earn an additional $60 million of PPP revenue over the coming two quarters.  Moving to slide 15. Overall, Truist intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, enhancing current earnings while being positioned to take advantage of higher rates both at the short and long ends of the curve. We estimate 100 basis point ramp increase in rates would increase NII by 5%, 100 basis points shock would increase NII by 10%. Approximately 75% of this reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve.  As a rule of thumb, one 25 basis point Fed hike with a 25% beta would increase net interest income by $25 million per month and increase net interest margin 6 basis points, all else being equal.  Moving to slide 16. Reported fees were down 2% from last quarter, largely due to changes in our non-qualified plan. Absent the impacts of the non-qualified plan, fees performed well and were consistent with our guidance of relatively stable.  The driving factors of the stable performance quarter-over-quarter were investment banking and trading increased $61 million versus the prior quarter due to higher syndication fees, structured real estate and record M&A results; insurance income increased $21 million, primarily due to organic growth and seasonal improvements from the third to fourth quarter. These quarterly increases were offset by decline in other income of $107 million or $70 million excluding changes in the non-qualified plan, largely driven by the valuation adjustment for the Visa-related derivative and lower revenue from our SBIC funds. For the full-year 2021, excluding security gains, fees were up 10% versus the prior year or more than $800 million, propelled by our diverse business model, favorable market conditions and Truist's increasing size, scale and relevance across multiple businesses. We are also making good progress early in our IRM initiative, particularly between the connectivity between CCB, wealth and CIB.  Insurance income increased 20% year-over-year, primarily driven by a very strong organic growth of 11% and acquisitions. This was our 99th year of insurance business, our best one yet, and we believe that 2022, our 100th year, can be even better.  Investment banking and trading was also up over $400 million, largely due to record performances of syndicated finance, M&A, equity, structured real estate and asset securitization. M&A revenue doubled relative to 2020 and the lead syndication roles in syndicated finance were up 26% year-over-year, both reflecting our strategic relevance to our clients.  On the flip side, residential mortgage income was down year-over-year $445 million or 45%, primarily due to a sharp decline on gain on sale margins and lower refinance activity.  Turning to slide 17. Reported expenses were $3.7 billion for the quarter, including $212 million of merger-related costs and $215 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Adjusted expenses decreased 3.9% sequentially, at the  end of our guidance of down 3% to 4%. Drivers for the decline include decreased personnel costs, which were a result of lower salary expenses, lower incentive costs, lower medical claims and changes in the non-qualified plan. Average FTEs declined 3%, including service finance from the prior quarter.  Adjusted expenses also declined due to elevated equipment and marketing expenses in the third quarter. Full-year adjusted expenses were up only 1% despite the adjusted fee income growing 10% year-over-year. This limited increase demonstrates the cost saving success we have achieved throughout the year and our overall discipline on expense management.  Moving to slide 18. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio, the favorable economic conditions and the effects of stimulus.  Our net charge-off ratio increased to 25 basis points from 19 basis points in the third quarter due to seasonality in the consumer losses and lesser commercial recoveries. ALLL coverage ratio decreased to 1.53%, which is just below our CECL day one levels, resulting in a provision benefit of $103 million in the fourth quarter as the economic scenarios continue to improve.  Continuing on slide 19. Capital and liquidity levels remained very strong. Our CET1 ratio declined from 10.1% to 9.6%, driven by organic loan growth, share repurchases and the service finance acquisition. Our established near-term target for CET1 of 9.75% has not changed, although the ratio declined to 9.6% in the fourth quarter. We anticipate being somewhat below our 9.75% CET1 target in the near term, given the improving loan growth outlook and the CECL phase-in for the first quarter.  We also do not anticipate repurchasing any shares for the first half of 2022.  Moving to slide 21. We achieved major milestone in October with the successful migration of our BB&T retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem. We have three significant integration milestones remaining, completing the Truist Digital First migration, finalizing the remaining branch consolidations in the first quarter, and the migration of our SunTrust retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem, which will occur in February.  The visual culmination of this process will be 6,000 more Truist signs across our markets at branches, ATMs, retail and corporate offices, finally allowing us to serve as one brand for our clients. Once the integration is complete and all the systems have been converted, Truist will be a much simpler company to operate, allowing us to provide even better service to our clients.  Turning to slide 22. We continue to be committed to achieving our $1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress in each of the five categories. Third-party spend is down 11.5% from baseline levels, exceeding our targeted reduction of 10%. Our sourcing team continues to make great strides in achieving savings despite the impacts of inflation. And the good news is there are fewer contracts to renegotiate in 2022 due to the higher volume of contracts renegotiated during Truist's first two years. We are on track to deliver over 800 total branch closures by the first quarter of 2022. And we are about 90% of the way towards our non-branch facility reduction target.  Average FTEs are down 11% since the merger excluding acquisitions. Additionally, technology savings were materialized after redundant systems are decommissioned in the second half of 2022.  Turning to slide 23. Core non-interest expense was $2.94 billion in the fourth quarter, meeting our target for the quarter. As a reminder, core non-interest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time the merger closed. Going forward, we will focus primarily on adjusted expenses, and not core, as adjusted expenses represent what we believe will be the run rate going forward.  I will now provide guidance for the full-year 2022 and for the first quarter. In 2022, we expect total revenue to grow 2% to 4% from 2021 as a result of higher net interest income, combined with solid growth in fees. The lower end of the range reflects two Fed hikes, with one in June and the second in December, while the upper end reflects 3 to 4 rate hikes throughout the year. This guidance includes the initial financial impact from the new Truist One account and related fee reductions in 2022.  Adjusted non-interest expense is expected to only increase 1% to 2% in 2022 as a result of inflation, increased investments and expenses from acquisition in 2021, partially offset by the ongoing cost savings, including achieving our final cost save target in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Merger-related and restructuring costs and incremental operating expenses related to the merger are anticipated to be approximately $800 million in 2022, with these expenses going away in 2023.  Given these factors, we anticipate positive operating leverage on both a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2022. This is the primary metric we will hold ourselves accountable to this year.  We also expect net charge-offs ratio to be between 30 basis points and 40 basis points in 2022, given favorable economic conditions and the assumptions for normalization throughout the year, with some quarter-to-quarter variability. Excluding discrete items, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and 21% if you model us on a taxable equivalent basis.  Looking into the first quarter, we expect total revenues to decline approximately 1% to 2% from fourth quarter levels. Given two fewer days, lower purchase accounting accretion and PPP revenue, continued pressures on mortgage and the typical seasonal patterns in certain fee categories like payments and service charges. This will be partially offset by seasonality and insurance.  Reported net interest margin should be down a couple of basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion, although expect core to be relatively flat. We expect adjusted expenses to increase 1% to 2% next quarter from the fourth quarter levels, partially due to the seasonality and personnel expense, given FICA and 401(k) and partially due to higher marketing expense as we continue to roll out the Truist brand post conversions.  Now I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude. Yeah, Matt. I think we were at the conference in the fourth quarter, we said we would have around 3% inflation. That's about $400 million. That's what we're ballparking for us for next year. We have the benefit, obviously, of having our third tranche of cost saves coming through in 2022, which really makes the adjusted expense growth pretty moderate versus not having those cost saves. About $20 million a quarter. If you looked at my prepared remarks, we talk about net interest income. We really right now have in our base forecast only two Fed increases, one in June and one in December. That's the lower end of the revenue guide. Obviously, if you look at the forwards markets where they are today, it's I think 3.8 times, so almost four Fed moves factored in. That would get us to the higher end of the curve. We gave you a couple of metrics. We're using a 25% beta in our rate sensitivity. And that 25% beta equates to about $25 million per month for every Fed increase that we have there. If you look back historically and look back at the recession that we had when Fed started to raise rates in 2015 and 2016, the betas for the first 100 basis points were 15%. And we're modeling 25%. So I think we're a little bit conservative on that side. We'll see how things play out. We are modeling a higher beta when you go up over 100 basis points. So, the next 100, we're at 35. And then anything over 35, we're at a 50% beta. It's kind of the assumptions we're using.  On the fee side, we feel pretty  growth on the fee side. We had momentum there. We had a tremendous year in 2021. We still think we'll continue to have pretty good pull through of revenue, with the exception of mortgage just because of lower spreads and volumes. Ken, as I said before, our trajectory on expenses is not just down every quarter, it moves up and down. Obviously, we've got some seasonal factors going from fourth to first with FICA and 401(k). And then, we are building our marketing budget and basically rolling out our Truist brand across the whole footprint pretty aggressively to build brand awareness.  I think as the quarter and years play out, I think you're going to see expenses maybe pick up a little bit. And then,. as we get through all the technology decommissioning, that's probably the biggest cost saves to still come through. That's really back end loaded right now. We still have 400 branches that will go away early in the quarter. But for the most part, other real estate and technology savings are probably the biggest savings, which will be towards the end of the quarter. And we feel really good about still hitting our target that we originally set when we announced the merger. If you look at the investments we're making this quarter versus last year, it's probably double what it was. So, we're actually investing more in the company and still achieving our cost saves. Gerard, I think as we've said before, we're going to continue to look at sort of where we are in our merger integration, where the economy is, the health of our business and make those adjustments on an ongoing basis. And this won't be a quarterly kind of thing, but just as we see significant shifts in those criteria, evidenced by the fact we went from 10% to 9.75%, and also the fact we've got flexibility. The good news was we had loan growth at the end of the quarter that probably exceeded our expectations and that took our CET1 a little below that target, which we think is great. By the way, that's the sort of high class way to go below that target.  So, as we go through the process this year, we go through the CCAR process, look at all the stress testing results, I think sometimes toward the middle or the end part of this year, we'll take another harder look and be more communicative about where another goal might be. The only thing else I want to add to that, if you look at our net interest income, just to remind you, we have run off of purchase accounting accretion of about $400 million planned for year-over-year. And we have about $325 million run off of PPP planned to be lower year-over-year.  So, for us, just to be flat in NII, 6.5%, the guidance that we gave for revenue growth has net interest income being up maybe a little bit, maybe 1% on a GAAP basis, but that's really 8% if you look at the real true operations of the company and potentially up to maybe 10% if we get rate increases and maybe some more loan growth. So, the company is really performing at high levels from a production basis on the amount of volume that we're putting through on the asset side of the equation. I'll do your latter question first. So, the base for 2021 revenue is $22.3 billion, is kind of base I would grow off of. And then, for the Truist One, recall in Bill's remarks, it's probably going to start in the second quarter. And it's probably anywhere from a third to 40% of the impact would be in 2022 and probably spread out evenly over second, third and fourth quarter, and then kind of builds up in '23 and then the full run rate in '24 of $300 million. It's a good question. And to the latter part of your question, there is some normalization of rate dependency to get to that lower efficiency ratio. And we won't make as much move on that in the next year, but our efficiency ratio on a relative basis, I think, will continue to be industry leading. So I think the ability to invest in our business, do it in a way that, to your points of scale, achieves a much more efficient company. I think we'll be able to continue that progress.  And then, if we get some sort of normalization of rates, I think looking out over a two and three year period, I think the low 50s is a reasonable target in a normalized kind of right environment. Yeah, so the base is correct. What you said was right, Erika. And then, if you look in our tables in the back of the appendix, we actually gave guidance around that out there. So you'll be able to easily kind of fill in your models with all that information. So, it'll make it easy for you. No, we always exclude amortization. It's in the footnote definition."

So, I would say we are underwriting more or less at a normal through the cycle rate. So, right in the middle of the field. We're not on the aggressive and we're not on the conservative end. I think we're meeting the market through our long-term approach. Obviously, it's very competitive out there. There are aggressive structures and pricing considerations that we have to deal with every day.

So, I would say for us, we're in a pretty normal approach, albeit watching those areas that might have been impacted structurally by the pandemic \u2013 CRE, office, things like that.

            "content": "Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining our call. We hope that your new year is off to a good start and that you and your families are doing well.  I'm very pleased with Truist's strong fourth quarter results. Fee income was solid, reflecting our diverse business mix of favorable conditions and investment banking and insurance. Net interest income is starting to improve, exceeding expectations. Credit quality was outstanding, resulting in another provision benefit. We delivered on our expense goals as adjusted non-interest expense decreased almost 4% and drove 3% sequential positive operating leverage. Loan growth, excluding PPP, is strengthening and we have momentum going into this year. I'll share more details on these topics during the presentation.  And turning to slide 4. As always, I'm going to begin with purpose which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We believe our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions.  Our purpose-driven culture is also the foundation for how we attract and retain top talent. People simply want to work for and do business with companies that stand for something meaningful. This culture, combined with our comprehensive compensation and benefit packages, significant and ongoing training development and career mobility and our more flexible approach to work will be our formula for attracting and retaining the best talent at Truist and competing and winning in the ongoing war for talent.  Slide 5 highlights some of the ways we're putting our purpose into action. This slide is organized around the same major themes contained in our CSR and our ESG report since they are topics that are most relevant to all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. I could not be more proud of both the quantity and, most importantly, the quality of the work being done across all these dimensions and the tremendous impact we're having in our communities.  While I can't cover every point on the slide, let me highlight a few. On the technology front, we were excited to welcome our teammates to the recently completed Innovation and Technology Center in Charlotte. I look forward to our external grand opening in the first half of the year.  As you know, Truist has an unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. And I'm very pleased to report that we recently achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles to at least 15%. This was a year earlier than our original commitment. While we're proud to have achieved this milestone, we acknowledge that this is actually the beginning and not the end.  We've also intentionally implemented a flexible work strategy for our teammates, which includes onsite, remote and hybrid options. Hybrid and more flexible work is here to stay. And I've learned the meaning and the power of intentional flexibility, the concept of people coming together as a team, whether in the office or not, and intentionally deciding what works best for them, their team, our clients and the company, while remaining highly engaged and, most importantly, purposeful.  Finally, we released our inaugural TCFD report in mid-December, which adds further context and disclosures to our previous CSR and ESG reports. At Truist, we view all the elements of ESG as an opportunity to improve our company and operationalize our purpose, including climate change. For instance, we're adding new teammates within CIB and our commercial community bank who are going to help our clients transition to a lower carbon economy.  Now, turning to slide 7, this quarter, we had $163 million of after-tax, merger related and restructuring charges and $165 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The total EPS impact of merger-related costs was $0.25 a share.  While our decision to create a best of both model of integration has resulted in increased upfront cost, I firmly believe it creates the best platform for future investment and growth. The good news is that total merger costs will be cut approximately in half in 2022 compared to last year and then fall out of our expense base entirely after this year.  Now turning to our fourth quarter performance on slide 8. As I indicated, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year as most areas were generally in line or somewhat ahead of our expectations. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.13 earnings per share for the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding the merger impacts on the prior slide, we earned $1.9 billion or $1.38 per share. Primary driver of changes in EPS relative to both the prior quarter and the year ago was the loan loss provision, given the rapidly evolving economic environment over the past two years.  We generated strong returns, including 22.6% adjusted ROTCE, which was unchanged from last quarter. Excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still a very strong 19.6%.  Asset quality continues to be an excellent story and net charge-offs were in line with our guidance. Capital deployment was robust during the fourth quarter as we funded strong organic loan growth, closed the service finance acquisition in early December and repurchased $500 million worth of common stock. We'll provide more details about loan growth momentarily.  On the merger integration front, we completed the first part of the core bank conversion in mid-October by migrating our heritage BB&T clients to the Truist ecosystem. As part of the conversion, we launched the new truist.com as well as our digital commerce account opening platform. Since then, our integration teams have completed two successful dress rehearsals for a final conversion, one in mid-December and one just this past weekend. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and dedication to this effort. Because of them, we're on track for the final core conversion in February, during which our heritage SunTrust clients will be migrated to the Truist ecosystem. Looking at full-year 2021, Truist had a productive year across multiple dimensions. From a financial perspective, we generated significant adjusted net income of $7.5 billion or $5.53 per share and had an adjusted ROTCE of 22%.  While our earnings undoubtedly benefited from a $3 billion lower loan loss provision due to the improving economy, we also demonstrated the strength of our diverse business mix. Fee income, excluding security gains, increased a very strong 10% as we were firing on multiple cylinders. This performance helped offset a 45% decline in mortgage fee income and a 6% decrease in net interest income.  We also continued to deliver on our cost save programs, evidenced by adjusted expenses increasing only 1% during the year, which saw much larger increases in fee income. We also experienced a reduction in our risk profile due to the improving economy and merger integration progress, which enabled us to reduce the CET1 target by 25 basis points to 9.75 and deploy significantly more capital.  Overall, we were able to make great progress on multiple fronts despite continued headwinds from the pandemic, while delivering improved financial performance for our shareholders.  Now turning to slide 10. Our new Truist digital experience reflects two of our core digital and technology principles, co-creation with our clients and moving fast in order to learn fast.  Our more modern and agile platform allows us to incorporate this feedback quickly, the results of which can be seen in the significant improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores, as well as in our Apple App Store and Google Play store ratings in just a few short months. We've now migrated approximately 9 million retail, wealth and small business clients to the Truist digital experience through December, more than 85% of active clients have begun to use the new digital platform in lieu of their heritage app.  On slide 11, you'll see a visual of our new corporate and commercial digital platform, which we'll call a Truist One View. This platform will provide our clients with a comprehensive view of their existing treasury management and lending solutions via streamlined and client-specific experience designed to reduce the time required to perform routine financial task. Including the launch of Truist One View to our commercial clients, Truist has introduced new web and mobile platforms for each of our client segments across retail, wealth, business and corporate. More than 2,000 features were released across these platforms in 2021, and we've done this at a pace that neither heritage company could have achieved on their own.  More broadly, as you can see from the charts on the left, we continue to position ourselves to serve the robust demand for digital services. Digital lending, mobile check deposits, and Zelle transactions all exhibited double-digit growth during the year.  We feel good about our current digital performance, and we believe that our progress will accelerate after the final core bank conversion, in part due to the advantages and efficiencies associated with having one website, one search engine optimization process, one brand, one system, and one digital application, but also in part due to the new capabilities that we'll be able to introduce this year, including our new AI-driven insights tool, our new Truist virtual assistant, and the Truist Developer Center, which will position us to innovate and collaborate with the developer community. Having our teams focus on the new Truist experience versus managing three separate experiences will provide a significant productivity lift as we move forward.  Lastly, we have plans to make strong digital progress in other areas this year from our new partnership and integration with AutoFi, enhancing our InsurTech capabilities via integrating insurance directly into our mortgage process, and launching a new deposit product with LightStream on a real-time cloud-based core.  Now, turning the loans and leases on slide 12. Average loans stabilized after decreasing for five consecutive quarters, and peeling back the onion reveals positive and improving underlying trends. Excluding PPP, average loans increased approximately 1% sequentially and end of period loans grew approximately 2%, reflecting momentum late in the quarter.  The most notable improvement was in C&I where end-of-period balances, excluding PPP, grew $6.3 billion or 5%, reflecting broad-based growth across corporate and commercial lines of business. This was the strongest point-to-point C&I loan growth since the first quarter of 2020. Most CIB, industry and product groups demonstrated growth, most notably within our asset finance group. Broad-based growth was also evident within our commercial community bank where 12 of the 21 regions grew C&I loans excluding PPP during the quarter and we continue to see the most growth in markets that are relatively more open. Every single one of our industry specialty groups within CCB grew, a strong reflection of how our clients value industry expertise and advice.  Revolver utilization also ticked up after six straight quarters of declines. And equally important, total revolver exposure continues to grow, evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion.  Residential mortgage continues to grow, reflecting slower prepayment speeds, our decision to balance sheet certain correspondent production, and increase capacity post conversions and COVID. Excluding mortgage, consumer balances decreased slightly, primarily due to seasonality in our Sheffield business and continued declines in our government guaranteed student loan portfolio.  Service finance closed on December 6, and we feel great about their trajectory heading into 2022. In addition, some of the areas that have been headwinds like dealer floorplan and CRE are beginning to stabilize.  Overall, corporate commercial clients remain optimistic despite ongoing labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. We're encouraged by the momentum we observed in the fourth quarter, but also on our pipelines, which are the highest they've been in some time. We continue to believe there's meaningful upside to the C&I growth story as the economy continues to improve, although the timing remains imprecise.  We also continue to feel confident in our consumer trajectory as we're well positioned with respect to faster growing segments through our digital and point-of-sale businesses, which will offset headwinds in other areas.  Now turning to deposit fund, slide 13. Average deposits increased $8.2 billion or 2% compared to the third quarter, largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus and seasonality related to public funds.  We've also been able to help our clients along their financial journey through our industry-leading child tax credit awareness initiative. Through this initiative, which promotes savings and financial confidence, clients and communities most in need were able to grow their savings and IRA balances by 9% and 15% respectively from May through December. I think this is a great example of what we call purposeful growth.  But we know we can do more, and thus guided by our purpose, we have been reinventing a new checking account experience that aligns with our clients' needs, which we believe will provide them more flexibility, lower cost and more financial confidence.  Truist One Banking will be our new flagship, differentiated and disruptive suite of checking solutions that redefine everyday banking and accelerate our journey towards purposeful growth.  Truist One will have zero overdraft fees. The capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need via a simple $100 negative balance buffer, as well as a deposit based credit line limit of up to $750. These features will help clients manage their liquidity needs far more cost effectively than alternative products. You're going to learn more about these details right after this call. These solutions will be available to all clients this summer, given our need to first finish the conversion. In addition, Truist will discontinue overdraft protection, negative account balance and return item fees in the coming months for all existing accounts.  Long term, this is a win-win for all of our stakeholders as we'll increase client acquisition, particularly next gen clients, enhanced deposit growth and simply improve the overall client experience.  In the near term, however, there will be a financial cost, both as a result of the introduction of Truist One and the reduction of other fees. We expect these changes collectively to result in an approximately $300 million or almost 60% reduction in overdraft-related revenue by 2024. The impact will begin in a few months and build over time as more clients benefit from the Truist One experience.  I'm now going to turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in more detail. Thank you, Daryl. Slide 24 is our investment thesis which is built on four pillars or themes that we believe truly differentiate Truist and allow us to inspire and build better lives and communities as well as deliver purposeful growth for all of our stakeholders. I also think it's the same reason I've got the best job in banking. I shared color on this refreshed investment thesis with many of you in December.  So, on slide 25 and in summary and conclusion, Truist had a very good 2021, highlighted by improved financial performance, strong fee income from our diverse business model, significant capital deployment and strong risk management as evidenced by our excellent asset quality metrics. We also made substantial integration progress, taking many significant steps towards becoming One Truist.  As we look into 2022, our formula is going to be simple. First, we'll complete the merger in the first quarter, eliminate merger related costs by year-end and achieve our cost saves, all of which will help us produce positive operating leverage.  Second, we'll begin to pivot from an integration focus to an operating focus on executional excellence and growth. The momentum we have going into 2022, combined with being One Truist across all dimensions \u2013 technology, digital, brand, products, process \u2013 gives me great confidence in our performance and potential as we make and complete this pivot.  Lastly, we'll have the capacity to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders as integration risks subside and the economy stays on sound footing.  So with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur for Q&A. John, the simplest way to think about it is the 2% sort of assumes a flattish kind of NII. And the upside of the 2% to 4% is in the NII. And then the balance of the growth is non-interest income. John, maybe I'll do a little sort of where we are and what the jumping off point is to put a little put a little context around that. As you well know, loan growth is a function of production utilization, pay downs, and pipelines is the way that I like to think about the about the formula in its most simple way. And as we finished the fourth quarter, we really saw the production start to increase, utilization was up about 2.5 points, which was \u2013 that's the first time we've seen a swing in the utilization front. And that was pretty universal. So, we felt good about that from a momentum standpoint. Paydowns were up a little bit, but maybe most importantly, is the pipelines were at really, really high levels. So, our CCB pipeline, our CIB pipeline and our CRE pipelines all were at historically sort of high levels compared to the quarter and compared to this time last year. Usually, this time of year, you're starting to clean out pipelines and sort of trying to refresh in the first quarter. So, we enter this with a little more confidence and momentum than maybe we have in the past. On the consumer side, we have some headwinds from student loan, but that was really just left purchases available. So, I think that's sort of a little bit of a conscious kind of decision. And then home equity, which I think just is a symbol of sort of how people want to borrow in the future, but remember, things like service finance are coming on. So, we completed that purchase in early December. So we'll sort of get the benefit of that on the consumer side as we come through.  So, in terms of thinking about the whole year and thinking about puts and takes, I think sort of a mid-single digit from here kind of growth rate based upon everything we know now, nothing else changing, so on and so forth, I think is sort of eminently achievable, and I think reflective of the momentum we have right now. One other point I'd add. I think Daryl was making this earlier. This also covers the investments that we're making. So, we have this unique opportunity, in that we've got cost saves out of us, but the ability to cover not only the inflation pressures, but also our investments in talent, our investment in technology, the ability to grow our businesses, that's all factored into this guidance. Ken, if it's okay, I'm going to let John sort of hit that directly. I'll take a crack at that. Obviously, that's an extremely high focus area for us. If we start with deposit and client side, I would say it's been exceptional and exceeded our expectations. The branch closures, retention numbers have been really in the high, high 90s. I think it's just a reflection of clients' confidence in us, our presence in the market and our ability to handle their needs, whether it's digital or whether it's physical. So, that part has been exceptional, exceeded probably all expectations.  And the same thing we see it in the deposit growth. Those are hard numbers, look at market share, but I feel like we're taking share in that sense, in that retention model. As it moves to teammates, I think you and I have talked about this. Right into the first year of the merger, our retention numbers were actually higher for Truist compared to each heritage company. So our teammates had voted for the merger and wanting to be part of that. And we look at not only overall with retention, we look high performer retention. We divide it up a lot of different ways. Obviously, that attrition has picked up. And that's picked up across the industry. I still think on a relative basis, we look really strong from that standpoint.  And if you think about what's going to happen to us, we also changed the denominator a bit when we closed a lot of branches and we're still consolidating. So, our ability, I think, to stay ahead of the attrition game, I think we're really, really well positioned from that standpoint.  But also, and maybe equally importantly, is our attractiveness to hire talent has never been better. We are bringing in some fantastic people that want to be part of our company. They've bought into our purpose. They love the idea of being on a strong legacy company that feels like a startup. So, it's got sort of a nice combination to it. Our commitment and capacity to innovate, make investments has been really attractive. So our attrition numbers are up. There's no doubt about that in the last year. Everybody else's is. I think on a relative basis, we're okay. We manage it to an absolute, though. That's the way I think about it. And our ability to attract talents, really, really strong. Never been stronger. I think the commitment to positive operating leverage is clear in our guidance. Related to how much we achieved, I think given we've had a pretty conservative forecast on the rate increases, if we get additional rate increases, this was predicated \u2013 the 1% in your lineup was predicated on two rate increases. If we get more, those sort of follow straight through to the bottom line. So, we create more operating leverage.  But I also think, the point I made earlier, we're continuing to invest in this business. We're not going to achieve positive operating leverage and starve our business. The ability to achieve the cost saves, redeploy them into the appropriate investments for the long term, that was the vision of Truist. That was the premise upon which we established this merger.  And I think, arguably, and it'd be hard to dispute, it's taken a little bit longer. Some of those were decisions we made, the best of both was a little more expensive than we had anticipated at the outset. But I think you're really starting to see, and I can feel, you can feel it in the pivot in the fourth quarter, you can feel it in the pivot in our guidance, of the promise of Truist is manifesting itself in not only positive operating leverage, but purposeful growth and an ability to invest in the business for the long term.  So, yes, we're committed to positive operating leverage, underlined, exclamation point and all the other comments, but in a way that we're continuing to invest to grow our business for the long term. I think it's a combination of things, John. When I'm out visiting with clients, demand is never the issue for business. They all have demand. And that cuts across actually a wide swath of industries and geographic locations. So, the ability to do business.  I think you're seeing a couple things. One is, I think what your premise was, and your question, people building a little inventory, sort of anticipating, trying to get ahead some of the supply chain, I think you see that. Then you just see stuff happening, like in the dealer side, cars are showing up on lots. They may be showing up on lots needing a chip, or whatever it may be, but they're showing up. So the ability to borrow against those capacities. And then, I think people are just making the decisions to move forward. Deploying capital, they've had plans. If they've delayed plans, they're continuing to look at the current Omicron as potentially a short term situation that reverses itself, and they don't want to get behind. They're all in competitive situations. So, I think they're deploying capital against the opportunities that they've had planned for the several years. So I think it's a combination of a lot of things, just resiliency of the economy and a little bit of positioning to get one step ahead of both supply chains, wage pressure, whatever it may be and the competition. The thing I would add, Ebrahim, and what I said on Mike's call, the run-off of the purchase accounting accretion gets easier year after year. So, the ability to drive positive operating leverage will get easier as we go out two, three, four years. Maybe just to clarify the first part of your question, we've been on offense. I think it's just an ability to be further on offense and to accentuate that capability. If you look at virtually all of our categories, if you think about insurance, as an example, relative to insurance, if you think about our investment banking relative to investment banking, if you think about deposit growth, loan growth, client acquisition, digital adoption, whatever measures you want to choose on a relative basis, I feel like we're already gaining share. And I think, to your point, our capacity to gain share, our competitiveness, the breadth and depth of our product capability, the talent that we have on the field, the training that they're receiving, the way they work together and integrated relationship management, the way that they allow all cylinders of the company to benefit the client, we've just never been more competitive against small, against regional, against large. I think all the things that we wanted to see and feel from Truist are absolutely coming to bear on the field every day."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.\nAnkur Vyas: Thank you, Allen (ph). Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist third quarter 2021 earnings call. With us today are our CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Daryl Bible. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third-quarter results, and also share perspectives and how we continue to activate Truist purpose, our progress on the merger, and current business conditions. Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer, Beau Cummins, our Vice-Chair, and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The acCompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information, are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir. truist.com.

In addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Ankur. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I hope everyone's well and safe. I'm very pleased by Truist continued progress on our solid third-quarter performance. Our quarterly results reflect the diversity of our business mix, which drove strong fee income and helped overcome continued softness in net interest income. Credit quality was outstanding, resulting another provision benefit. Loan growth was modest, excluding PPP, generally in line with our expectations. We also achieved a major integration milestone this past weekend, and we'll share more details on these topics during the presentation. If I move you to slide 4, I'd like to begin with our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We believe our purpose-driven culture is the primary factor behind our success as a Company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions. A recent example of this was our decision to remain open during our conversion last Saturday, so we could care for our clients and address any questions. To my knowledge, that's the first for a major systems conversions such as ours. I've said in our culture, purpose, performance, teamwork, and a client-first mindset, all coexist, and there's no better evidence of that than the extraordinary success our teammates delivered this past weekend in our most significant merger milestone to-date, details of which I'll cover shortly. Slide 5 describes how we're living out our purpose and highlights some of the notable progress we've made during the quarter. During the pandemic, philanthropic giving was a natural way to put our purpose into action due to the effects of the coronavirus on our clients, teammates, and communities. Our purpose is much broader than philanthropy. We developed this slide around major themes contained in our CSR and ESG report because they're the topics that are most important to all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. I won't cover every point on the slide. Let me just highlight a few. We continue to make strong progress against our $60 billion community benefits plan, currently a 112% of target, including the ongoing impact that Truist Community Capital provides our communities with regards to affordable housing, access to healthy food and education, and investments and job creation in small business. Truist and [Indiscernible] announced that all elementary school students nationwide will soon have access to workforce universe, a digital early literacy program. I'll talk more about this shortly, but we've migrated 7 million clients to the new Truist digital banking experience, which includes enhanced digital investment, money management capabilities, personalized insights, and a holistic personal financial management tool. We committed to increase diversity in our senior leadership roles to at least 15% by 2023. We're currently at almost 14%, and clearly on track. Importantly, long-term, the way we create a more diverse senior leadership organization is by recruiting diverse early talent and then developing, retaining, and promoting over time. And for early career program hiring in 2021, 64% of the seats at Truist were filled by diverse candidates. All of this progress combined with enhanced disclosures has resulted in solid improvements in our ESG scores. Lastly, in a few weeks we'll release our inaugural Truist TCFD report. Our teammates and I are very proud of Truist and all the ways we deliver on our purpose. So turning to the third quarter performance highlights on Slide 7, we earned $1.6 billion or $1.20 earnings-per-share for the quarter on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, we earned 1.9 billion or $1.42 -- $1.42 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 46% versus the same quarter last year, and is largely driven by the provision benefit. Sequentially, EPS declined 8% as we had a greater benefit from the provision last quarter and seasonally stronger revenues last quarter. We had strong returns, including a 22.6 adjusted ROTCE. Excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still very good, north of 19%. Revenues totaled $5.6 billion, fairly stable compared to last quarter. On an adjusted basis, year-over-year revenue growth was 2% as much stronger fee income offsets in almost 30 basis point decline in margin, and 8% decline in loans, a reflection of this unique environment that we're all in. The stronger adjusted fee income which grew 12% compared to a year ago, did drive slightly higher expenses than expected, but our PPNR is broadly in line with our expectations. Asset quality continues to be an excellent story, as we outperformed our net charge-off guidance with lower charge-offs across C&I combined with strong recoveries. During the quarter, we were pleased to increase the dividend 7%, and we completed the Constellation acquisition, which had a very good first quarter with Truist Insurance. Also, we announced the strategic acquisition of Service Finance, which will close later this year. Daryl will share some additional information on service finance, but it's broadly a reflection of Truist skating to where the puck is going, and partnering with a leader in home improvement point-of-sale lending. We also completed our retail mortgage origination conversions and benefits, which Daryl will also highlight later. Last but certainly not least, I'm very excited to report, this past weekend, we completed a major phase of our Core Bank conversion. After a lot of intense, deliberate, thoughtful, and purposeful preparation by our team, we were able to stand up the Truist technology ecosystem and migrate all heritage BB&T Retail Wealth and Business clients to it. Event went extremely well and there are number of notable positive impacts for clients and teammates. Starting this past Tuesday, over 2500 heritage BB&T &T teammates were able to log onto the new Truist commercial lending ecosystem for the first time. Because of the conversion, the Salesforce client management and sales pipeline system is now directly connected to the Encino lending origination system, which allows for better communication and workflow across the deal team, and visibility or progress of the loan all in one place. These upgrades also lay the foundation for future digital innovation. We're now able to offer Truist products to new clients and to heritage BB&T clients through our branches and digitally through t ruist.com, including our new Truist Ready Now Loan, a small dollar lending solution for existing clients to cover emergency financing needs between $100 and $1000, consistent with our belief on the importance of emergency savings. We upgraded our ATM, contact center, and digital payment capabilities across a number of dimensions, including more client self service, improved authentication, and operational simplification. While this was not a physical branding event, the conversion places us on excellent footing for the final conversion in the first quarter of 2022 when heritage SunTrust clients will transition to the Truist ecosystem and all branches will become Truist. Again, I want to congratulate our teammates on a job well done. They've prepared with intensity and purpose for multiple quarters. They learned and applied lessons from previous conversion work. They worked non-stop this past weekend, and delivered a seamless conversion. I really could not be more proud. Now, going to Slide 8. We have 3 significant items that negatively affected earnings during the quarter. First, merger charges totaled 132 million after-tax, lower than last quarter, because higher Voluntary Separation and Retirement Program costs were reflected in the second quarter. This VSRP program is one of the many components of our overall cost-saving goal. Approximately, half of our 2,000 teammates who elected to participate left on September 30th, and I cannot thank them enough for their long-standing efforts to build the foundation of Truist by helping create 2 amazing companies in BB&T and SunTrust, and then helping bring Truist to life during our almost first 2 years of existence. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger were 147 million after-tax. As a reminder, these are merger-related expenses but don't meet the technical definition of a merger-related and obstruction charges, will not be part of our run rate in 2023 and beyond. Also, we had a one-time professional fee accrual that met our disclosure and adjustment threshold, totaling 23 million after-tax. This fee was incurred to develop an ongoing program to identify, prioritize, and road map [Indiscernible] generated revenue growth and expense saving opportunities as part of the merger and beyond. This helps ensure that we'll achieve our 2022 cost save targets. It's also fuel for creating more capacity for investments in the future, will also improve the client experience, simplify our processes, and create a more engaged and energized workforce. Our teammates generated more than 50,000 -- 5,000 initial ideas, which we consolidated and narrowed down to approximately 1,000, and we're building the execution plan. Ultimately, our goal is for this to be an ongoing way of how we do business at Truist, and powering our teammates to identify and execute on ideas to improve our Company. The total impact on these 3 items was $0.22 per share. Moving to slide 9, as we've noted, Truist is the first large merger in the digital age, so we're highly focused on ensuring a smooth transition for our digitally active clients. Our new Truist digital experience for Flex 2 of our core digital and technology principles; co-creation with our clients and failing fast to learn fast. We built this new platform based directly on clients feedback, and we're introducing it in waves, learning from each release and getting better every time. We made great progress in the third quarter, inviting approximately 7 million retail wealth and small business clients to migrate to the Truist digital experience through September. But half of those clients have started and use the platform in lieu of their heritage app. By the end of this quarter, our goal is to migrate all digital clients to the Truist digital platforms. We've received ongoing feedback from our clients on incorporated opportunities for improvement iteratively over the course of the migration, which has resulted in an improved client experience over time. This de-risk our Core Bank conversion and makes Truist the first to de-link the front-end conversion from the back-end. A patented approach we can leverage for future back-end innovation. As you can see on Slide 10, we continue to experience healthy demand for digital banking services as our clients look for more convenient and effective ways to transact and manage their finances. The pace of digital adoption has been especially rapid in mobile. Active mobile users and Zelle transactions are up 11% and 58% respectively, year-over-year. Last quarter, I highlighted that we are creating a common core digital architecture and platform for retail wealth and small business clients, which creates agility and seamless client experiences, yet ones that are tailored and designed for the unique needs of each client segment. For our wealth clients, we provide a differentiated digital client experience that reflects their relationship with Truist. An integrated platform will provide a one-stop-shop for their holistic financial picture, including a unified investment portfolio experience that is agnostic to whether the account is a trust or brokerage account, holistic financial planning with external account aggregation, and the ability to secure, store, and exchange documents for their advisor, and the same access to low cost digital and automated investing that we now offer retail clients. Turning to slide 11, on an absolute basis, loans declined 2.4 billion sequentially. However, if you exclude the impact of PPP forgiveness, average loans increased 1.6 billion or 2.3% annualized consistent with our outlook. When you peel back the onion, there's some good trends, but we also have headwinds. PPP declined $4 billion on average in the quarter, and Dealer Floor Plan declined an additional billion. We expect PPP to decline an additional 2 billion or so on average in the fourth quarter. Dealer utilization is about 25%, well below historical averages. We've been somewhat cautious in CRE, although we're beginning to see opportunities in that space that meet our risk appetite and portfolio diversity objectives. Even so, that portfolio declined 1.2 billion sequentially. Excluding these items, Commercial Loans increased 1.1 billion or 0.9% sequentially. So we're seeing some improved momentum, More banking regions are experiencing core C&I growth. Pipelines in the Commercial Community [Indiscernible] and CRE businesses continue to grow. And our revolver exposure also grew 2% sequentially. Evidence of our relevance that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion. Big picture, our corporate and commercial clients remain optimistic, but labor shorter -- shortages of supply chain issues are affecting their businesses no different than Truist. Net-net, we believe there is meaningful upside to the C&I growth story as the economy continues to improve, pandemic-related disruption subside, and the liquidity-related distortions from ongoing government stimulus abate. But the timing of all this is difficult to predict. On the consumer slide, mortgage has shifted from a shrinking to a growing portfolio, reflecting increased operational capacity, slower prepaid speeds, and our tactical decision to balance sheet correspondent production. We're also seeing good performance with indirect auto, Light Stream, [Indiscernible] and credit card, all of which are growing versus last quarter. So turning to slide 12, we added this slide, this quarter to broad a little more color on growth in headwinds for average loans since there are several significant moving pieces. Long-term loan growth as an output and a highly correlated economic growth, which we believe is on firm footing, particularly in our markets. We also continue to pursue tactics and strategies to capture more than our fair share of loan growth within our risk appetite diversification objectives, including deepening our lending relationships with our wealth clients, increasing our digital and point-of-sale lending capabilities, and expanding our wallet share within certain corporate and commercial clients. Turning to slide 13. Average deposits increased 6.5 billion or 1.6% compared to the second quarter, largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus. More importantly, Truist continues to resonate with clients. We continue to make solid progress with quality account growth. Year-to-date, our net new personal DDA accounts grew almost 50,000 significantly higher than last year. Net new business DDA is up 11% year-over-year. In addition, client attrition from closed branches continues to be very low. This performance reflects excellent execution by our retail Community Bank teammates. And with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail.\nDaryl Bible: Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 14, net interest income was down slightly versus prior quarter. This was consistent with our guidance and reflected two competing factors. Purchase accounting accretion decreased 53 million [Indiscernible] quarter, and contributed 23 basis points to reported margin, down from 28 basis points in the second quarter. However, core non-interest income increased 41 million. This was driven by a larger investment portfolio, which resulted in strong deposit growth. We have more than offset lower PPP revenue. Core net interest margin decreased two basis points due to higher liquidity and lower PPP revenue. We expect to earn an additional 125 million in PPP revenues over the coming three quarters and for the balance to be demonyms by mid-2022. We continue to be asset-sensitive. We estimate that 100 basis point ramp increase would increase Nii by 4.1%. A 100 basis point shock would increase NII by 7.9%. We're also well-positioned to benefit from rising rates, at both the short and long end of the curve. 2/3 of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end, and it assumes a deposit beta of approximately 50%. In reality, we have experienced, over the last few years ago, deposit betas are likely to be significantly lower than our modeled assumptions when the first few rate hikes. For every 10% decline in deposit beta, our asset sensitivity increases by about 100 basis points. Moving to Slide 15. As Bill highlighted, we had a very strong quarter from a fee income perspective. Fee income, excluding security gains from last year, was up a very strong 12% like quarter exceeding our initial expectations. Insurance income increased 25% in total. This was due to acquisitions and also a very strong 12% organic growth. Investment banking at its best -- had its second-best quarter and record M&A performance. M&A results like this do not come in a vacuum, they're results of years of investment and commitment to our clients. Capital markets earn revenue was up 22% year-to-date. Growth remains very strong up 10% compared to a year ago as a result of market conditions but also positive asset flows. [Indiscernible] -related income was down after its record second-quarter performance, but momentum continues to be positive. Residential Mortgage was down [Indiscernible] quarter due to lower refinance activity. However, it increased 62 million sequentially, primarily due to better servicing income due to lower prepayment speeds and the addition of a new servicing portfolio. Production income also improved sequentially as we restored capacity after temporary reducing it last quarter. Other income of 131 million was also another high-water mark, largely due to valuation gains related to our SBIC funds. Our non-qualified plan continues to have positive valuation adjustments and we have now included the details of both the non-qualified plan and CVA in our earnings release tables. Turning to expenses on Slide 16. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.4% sequentially compared to our guidance of a relatively flat. Drivers included higher-than-anticipated fee income, which pushed incentives above our forecast, in addition to 32 million cost from the non-qualified plan. Excluding the effects of these items, adjusted expenses were only slightly above our expectations. On an absolute basis, adjusted non-interest expense increased primarily due to higher planned marketing costs, as we continue to build our brand awareness, as well as higher technology costs which are reflected in software and equipment expense. Moving to Asset quality on Slide 17. Asset Quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diversified portfolio, favorable economic conditions, and the effects of stimulus. Our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points, a pro forma post-financial crisis well. Leading indications -- indicators remain strong as MPLc and early-stage delinquencies remain low. Our AOOO coverage ratio decreased to 1.65% as the economic scenarios continue to improve, and -- but still remains above our CSO day one level 1.54%. We also had a provision benefit of 324 million. Continuing on slide 18, capital remains strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1% was above our near-term. 9.75% target. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter due to the effects of the recent acquisition activity. We have approximately 1 to 2 billion of potential capital deployment remaining through the third quarter of 2022. We expect to consume approximately 500 million of this capacity via share repurchases in the fourth quarter, reflecting our own capital position, reduced integration risks on the heels of very successful integration event we discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 19, we provide additional details about Service Finance. We continue to be very excited about Service Finance, and the acquisition is on track to close later this year. Service Finance is strategically attractive because it expands the scale and capabilities of our existing point-of-sale businesses, which is where the consumer preferences are shifting. In addition, we believe home improvement is in a secular growth phase, and the professional financing market is highly fragmented. Service Finance is the perfect partner for Truist, given its proven track record of business development and growth, its exclusive focus on home improvement, strong digital client experience, and excellent reputation in the marketplace. From a financial perspective, we have provided a few additional details to help you model the transaction. The vast majority of Service Finance revenue will come in net interest income. The NII is a mix of consumer interest income, and discounts provided by the merchants. Loan yields are in the high single-digits from a run rate perspective, though initially they are somewhat lower due to the impact of promotional period on an unseasoned loan portfolio. We expect production to grow at a fast pace over the coming years. We expect to allocate 1.1 billion to goodwill and 700 million to intangibles. We also expect to capture approximately 250 million in value over time from a step-up in tax basis. On a standalone basis, the acquisition is 4% GAAP dilutive in year 1. Half of this dilution is driven by the utilization of capital in lieu of share repurchases. The other half is driven by the first-year GAAP net income contribution. Earning streams take time to build as we transition from an originate-to-sell to an originate-to-hold model. But over the long term, it is extremely profitable and accretive to all of our KPIs. We did not model any future revenue synergies, but see many opportunities for better leverage, our combined capabilities, and accelerate our revenue and growth potential. We have terminated third-party partnerships with certain point-of-sale financing providers. The impact of this is 2 billion of runoff will begin in early 2022. Moving to the integration update on Slide 21. As Bill highlighted, we achieved a major milestone this past weekend with successful migration of our heritage BB&T retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem. Another milestone in the quarter was completing the migration of our Truist retail mortgage origination platform. Turning to slide 22, we are committed to achieving 1.6 billion of net cost saves, and continue to make progress in each of the five categories. Third-party spend is down 11.2% from the baseline levels, exceeding our targeted reduction at 10%. We closed 39 branches during the third quarter, bringing the cumulative closures to 413. We're still on track to achieve approximately 800 total closures by the first quarter of 2022. We are also 7/8 of the way towards our non-branch facility reduction target, which will likely have more reductions to come in 2022. Average FTEs are down 11% since the merger, excluding the acquisitions. We expect further declines in FTEs in the coming quarters to the -- due to the VSRP program, where the first quarter-wave of departures began on September 30th. Technology sales will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in 2022. We have also noted areas where we continue to make critical investments, including digital technology, talent, and acquisitions in select business lines. Turning to Slide 23, we still expect to incur total merger costs of approximately 4 billion through 2022. We have incurred cumulative merger costs of approximately 3 billion through the third quarter, reflecting a considerable integration work on Slide 21. We continue to expect these costs to decrease after the first quarter of final bank conversion and then drop off entirely after 2022. Continuing on Slide 24. Core non-interest expense was just over 3 billion in the third quarter. As a reminder, this calculation removes the effects of higher variable compensation due to fee income and corporate performance since 2019. Asset value changes in our retirement plan and acquisitions since the merger of equals. As a result, Core non-interest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time of the merger closed. Based on the trajectory of ongoing cost-save initiatives, we are on track to achieve the fourth quarter Core expense target. I will now provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Reported net interest margin is expected to decrease 5 to 7 basis points, with half attributable to lower purchase accounting and accretion, and the other half due to increased liquidity and less PPP revenue. We expect reported net interest income to decline 1% sequentially, entirely due to lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest income is expected to be stable. Fee income, excluding the non-qualified plan, is expected to be largely stable from the third quarter as strength of insurance, investment, banking, wealth, and CRE, is offset by lower mortgage revenue and lower SBIC valuation gains. Adjusted non-interest expense is expected to decrease 3% to 4% from the third quarter. The primary drivers are personnel expense driven primarily by VSRP, occupancy expense, and technology cost such as software and equipment expense. For those that leverage our core expense target for the fourth quarter to build the adjusted expenses, you must add back the impact of acquisitions and higher levels of incentive compensation expense, from the higher fees and performance relative to 2019. We expect net charge-off ratio to be 20 to 30 basis points given favorable economic conditions, although we expect some normalization of these levels over time. Finally, we expect further reductions in the A-Triple low ratio, assuming economic conditions remain healthy. Given all this, Truist should have positive operating leverage next quarter when compared to the third. Now I will turn it back to Bill to conclude.\nBill Rogers: Thanks Daryl. Slide 25 provides an overview of our value proposition. Made the details, obviously we've shared in the past. But flipping to slide 26 that provides some performance highlights that support our value proposition with actual performance this quarter. Our markets continue to have strong in-migration, the data of which can lag, fee income from insurance investment banking and wealth was up 20% year-over-year, and up approximately a billion dollars compared to 2019. our third-quarter results clearly reflect the potential for profitability levels to be industry leading as we come out of the merger. Lastly, we continue to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders, and we'll have that capacity to do more over time as integration risk subside and the economy stays on sound footing. So in conclusion, the effects of the pandemic are moderate, economy is getting better. We are one major step away from completing our integration process. We're beginning to shift from a more defensive to a more offensive position and from a merger focus to performance focus. We fully believe that Truist best days are ahead. So with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you and Q&A.\nDaryl Bible: Thanks, Bill. Allen, at this time, if you don't mind explaining how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to 1 primary question and 1 follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions]. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure that your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. And like Mr. Vyas said, please limit yourselves to 1 question and 1 follow-up question. We'll first go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi.\nBill Rogers: Morning. Ankur Vyas: Morning\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I had a first question just around the Service Finance acquisition. And I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about leveraging this acquisition from here, both on the merchant side, as well as on the customer side, talking about opportunities for expansion and integration into your platform, and then on the customer side cross-sell.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. Betsy, it's a great question. As Daryl mentioned, we didn't model any of that into the basic models. The basic model you saw is for the Service Finance as a standalone. One of the really attractive parts of this integration for Truist, it was the fact that they've developed relationships with 14 thousand contractors, 180 manufacturers, just so to think about that in context or 80 manufacturers, think about that in context, many of those which are existing clients of Truist.  We've got this incredible opportunity to expand those relationships, they are adding a lot of new clients to our base who are single-product clients, who we got an opportunity to expand using things like Light Stream and the capabilities that we have there using the prowess of our CIB bankers with the manufacturers, helping expand with the contractors. There's a whole another component to service finance, which is really interesting as the whole ESG Ps of what they're doing to create more energy efficiency, and the concept of just everything related to home improvement.  What we really like about service finance, it's a pure-play on the home side. If you think about all of the things that we have related to home. Think about insurance that we have related to home, think about home equity, think about mortgage, think about all the prowess and product and capabilities we have related to home.  We're just starting to explore those kind of opportunities. This is why we feel so good about this. This to us is where the buck's going, as I said, versus where it is. And to your question, I think those are significant opportunities ahead of us.\nDaryl Bible: And what I would add to that, Betsy, is that the returns on this will be eventually over 3% ROE business, and our risk-adjusted yield will be really attractive.\nBill Rogers: Yeah, just on the standalone. Yeah, exactly.\nDaryl Bible: Annual basis.\nBetsy Graseck: Follow-up question here, Daryl on the rate sensitivity, you did give us the first 100 basis points. And I know that the question is going to be, what about that second 100 basis points? The first 100 is really low deposit beta 15% historically, I think you mentioned, can you remind us what the deposit beta was like on that second 100? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: If you go back to the last rate cycle that we went to, it was basically when rates bottomed out that Fed moved up 6 times 150 basis points. If you look at the deposit betas the first probably 2 or 3 deposit betas was probably about plus or minus 20%. And then as it continued to climb, it was getting closer to 30% to 40%. I'm not sure if it ever really got to the 50% in the 6 moves that you saw there, but it gradually went up as every couple of moves happened in the last rebound with the Fed.\nBetsy Graseck: Right, so you never -- you never got over 100 or anything like that on those last couple of moves?\nDaryl Bible: No, I don't think we ever got to 50% beta on any even [Indiscernible].\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Alright, thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning guys.\nDaryl Bible: Good morning Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Daryl, maybe to start on the expenses. So you are reiterating the 294 billion and you're calling for expenses to decline 3%-4%. Can you maybe just talk high level about some of the puts and takes of -- on expenses as we move into 2022? Clearly the core is coming down due to expense saves, but we're hearing about cost inflation is increasing. You have a handful of insurance deals and insurance finance as well as investments in the business. So how should we think about the costs into '22 and maybe can they be down on an absolute or an adjusted basis into next year? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. We're still putting together our plan for 2022, but I'll tell you what I can tell you now. From a cost perspective, we have our 5 buckets that we talk about. We definitely will see more branch closures in the first half of 2022, with almost 400 more branches closing. They also will have more -- last corporate real estate, so more reductions in that space as 2022 comes along.  The big cost savings in technology will happen as we phase through the conversions in the first quarter, the decommissioning. We're going to reduce about 40% of the application systems and move towards from six data centers to three data centers, that will be big reductions in cost saves.  Bill talked about our continuation of our VSRP that will continue throughout in 2022. And then finally, we have that team-led synergies program to basically get synergies on expenses and revenues, and that will play out over the next couple of years. That will assure us to make sure that we get our expense targets and also give us ammunition to make more investments in digital technology and other talents.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And Bill, last quarter you were talking about green shoots in loan growth, and this quarter, I think it sounded a little bit more balanced. You are talking about core momentum. Can you maybe just talk about expectations for loan growth over the next few quarters on both the consumer and the commercial side?  What do you see as some of the drivers? And could we see something like Service Finance starting to help drive accelerating growth on the consumer side? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Before you start, can I finish that? From still '22 expenses, inflation is real and inflation is definitely going to be in our numbers. If you look at the last couple of years, we did not really factor our end inflation in '20 and '21. And not sure exactly what that number is, but it's probably, give or take around 2% of fee expense base.  And you also have to factor in acquisitions as well for '22, and the impact of that would have both revenue and expense. But at the end of the day we're going to have good overall operating leverage, probably top quartile when it's all said and done.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. Thanks for that addition, Daryl. But I think to that question, Ryan, that's the focus. I mean there are tons of puts and takes, but we're going to hit the expense targets that we committed to. I mean I feel very, very confident about that, and have a business that creates positive operating leverage and industry-leading efficiency.  That's the shift and the target that we're headed to. I didn't mean to imply that they weren't green shoots, I still think there are definitely green shoots, and I think they manifested themselves in this quarter, as we highlighted. When I think about loan growth as an output, output, I look at production pay downs, utilization, and pipelines selling those 4 elements and then try to see where they're going. On the production side, we're hitting some high points in the quarter for C&I and consumers, our production is strong.  Paydowns stayed pretty consistent. Paydowns are about where they have been. Utilization is still pretty flat, you could say grinding up in certain areas, but in fairness probably pretty flat. But pipelines are strong. In CIG and CRE and CCB for us, we're at high points for the last several quarters in pipelines. So it's hard to guide. If I said, view it as medium-term X PPP, I think low single-digit growth is at the forefront.  But our positioning sort of longer-term when liquidity comes out of this, I just feel great about our -- great about our positioning, and our capacity to -- we've grown our revolvers, so our utilization going up, the fantastic markets we're in, the business investments that we've made and talent, the consumer businesses as you pointed out, point-of-sale businesses, things that are just adding capabilities and adding more opportunity for us to capture growth as we go forward.  So I -- so yes, I think there are green shoots, hard to predict when they're going to grow. But I feel really, really good about how we're positioned.\nRyan Nash: Great, thanks for all the color, Bill.\nOperator: All right. The next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard? Gerard, your line might be on mute. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. I was on mute. I appreciate it. Good morning, gentlemen.\nBill Rogers: Morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Bill, can you share with us -- you've done some smaller acquisitions. Obviously, the most recent one is the finance Company, and then the insurance companies. Can you give us your picture of what you see, maybe, for added bolt-on opportunities that could be on the horizon for Truist?\nBill Rogers: Yeah. I'd say first, as Core Truist, I think the biggest opportunity is with Truist. I see the biggest opportunity to actualize and optimize the opportunity that came from this fantastic merger vehicle, so let me say that, as it's primary where we are going. But then the bolt-on, clearly on the insurance side.  I mean, we've had a fantastic track record on the insurance side. It is a really good toggle between organic and inorganic growth and managed well, and I would expect that to continue. Maybe other things that look around and bolt-on that are important to us strategically and add some scale; We've been adding a lot of talent. I view that as the equivalent of an acquisitions, so we've been adding talent and you see the benefits of that, for example, in the investment -- in the investment banking side.  But I think if you [Indiscernible], bolt-on and the places where we've -- where we're experienced or where we have opportunity, and then primary emphasis on Truist and maximizing and optimizing this merger.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you. And maybe this question could be directed at Clarke. The credit quality for you and many of your peers has been outstanding, particularly in the net charge-off area. Can you guys give us a flavor of how sustainable are these levels of very low net charge-offs, is it another 2 or 3 quarters and then maybe a creeping up to normalization as we enter '23 or end of '22?\nClarke Starnes: It's great question, Gerard, on what is the lower longer question for the industry. And I would say for us in the industry, we had significant stimulus, the accommodation programs, and frankly strong asset values, and all of those have been tailwinds. And you saw for us almost really historic low loss point for the quarter.  So we feel really good about where we are, and given the current economic backdrop, we would certainly expect to continue to see outperformance with, to your point, a steady return over time to normalization as we go into '22 and beyond. And so I think it can go on longer. It again depends on the economics scenario.  But for us right now, I think we would believe we have an opportunity to outperform and you will see that reflected in our 4Q guidance.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Bill.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nKen Usdin: Just when you think longer-term out about the points you made about operating leverage, efficiency, maybe there's some inflation, the business mix has changed. How confident are you -- do you remain in that low 50s long-term efficiency ratio and how much, if at all, is rates still part of that equation? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yeah, I would start with industry-leading efficiency. So let me start without the concept. I think given some normalization and rates, I feel really confident in the low 50s. But most importantly, being able to achieve positive operating leverage, being able to be industry-leading top or top quartile efficiency, I think, is imminently short, medium, and long-term achievable for Truist.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Got it. And then, just on the near-term perspective, can you just -- Daryl, can you just walk us through, when we take the 2940 in the slides and you kind of add back the add-backs, where approximately does this put us as a starting point for the end of the year on a GAAP basis for cost?\nDaryl Bible: Yeah. If you go back, you have to add back in incentive pieces on the acquisition pieces, as well as whatever non-qualified turns out to be, plus or minus. You probably get to -- we gave guidance on an adjusted expense number down 3% to 4% from where we are today. That is your starting off point for 2022.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Got it. And then we add back intangibles for the all-in.\nDaryl Bible: That's correct.\nKen Usdin: Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. Bill, you took over as CEO about a month ago and also announced changes to the senior leadership team. Obviously, all of these guys have been in very prominent roles since the deal was announced, I wouldn't expect meaningful changes. But any kind of tweak that we should expect or what was the process of picking who does what underneath you given some of changes? However you want to frame that. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. The great thing, Matt, is we have an incredibly strong, skilled, experienced, purposeful team. So I'm really fortunate to be surrounded by really great leaders. As you noted, we didn't want to put a lot of change in place because actually I feel really good about the momentum and where things are going.  So the leaders who were responsible for those businesses, we shifted a couple of things around, but they still have the primary responsibility that they had before. I'd say the shift though is more -- what I talked about in my opening statements, it's more of a transition from merging to operating.  That doesn't have anything to do with me or anything. It just has to do with the timing of where we are in those process. Getting this merger -- major conversion this weekend was just a shot of adrenaline for us, to be fair. I mean, that's a big significant milestone for us. And just gives us more confidence to be starting to shift some of our time, some of our responsibility, some of our focus to maximizing the opportunities that are true.  So I would say, if I were to describe the transition and what it feels may be different now, is that -- it's more of that. And I just think that's a function of timing and where we are and our confidence building.\nMatt O'Connor: And then just separately, can you talk about the retention of some of the front office client-facing folks really across the franchise? I would imagine initially there wasn't that much movement because of COVID, and I think you also had some retention agreement for key people. But just update us on how that's been going more recently as things have been opening up and maybe people in general are more open to looking elsewhere, not just at Truist, but the workplace overall. Chris Henson: Bill, let me put maybe a global perspective on it and then try to get a little more idiosyncratic to Truist. Globally, there's more activity and more people are moving and we see that particularly in some of the frontline areas and you don't drive around any place in the country where you don't see a help wanted sign, and we've got several million people out of the workforce right now.  So we and the industry are experiencing some of that. Going into this merger, our retention numbers in the first year to 18 months were actually better than they were at either Company. So our retention numbers were really, really good. They've turned over a spike up a little bit, but it's still I think below where the industry is. From everything that we can determine.  As it relates to some of our most senior team and what we look at, high performer turnover is one of the things that we look at in our senior team, I've been really pleased. We've been really solid and keeping the kind of players we want. The retention on those has been really good. The places that I worry about are frontline, teller, care centers, all those things, that's just a more challenging environment today than it was before.  And the other side of that is our ability to attract talent is fantastic. The people that wanted to join our Company and want to be part of what we're doing at Truist has exceeded any expectations that I might have had and they were really high. The opportunity for people that are here to grow and expand their careers and the opportunity to bring new talent in, I think is just really good at Truist. All that again with that global overlay of what's going on in the market in the world.\nMatt O'Connor: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi, Bill. You've spoken a lot about investing in technology and digital, and I think the expenses were a little elevated before you taken over the CEO reins. So it's good seeing that you're guiding for expenses to be 3% to 4% lower next quarter. But can you just talk a -- I think it was your quote saying, once the hoods open, let's fix the engine a little bit more than we could have otherwise done.  Where is the digital dividend, so to speak, going to come from as it relates to Truist and the extra efforts that you're putting in place? We can talk about the back office, with the cloud, or the front office with enhanced digital banking that you maybe didn't have before. Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. Mike, it's a great question. And I think about it in two ways, one digital dividend as you put it, but also the avoidance of opportunity cost. And that's really what's happening with this merger. So if you think about it in the core basis, we're creating a much more agile platform; so the ability to move fast, to add, to create more opportunities for our clients, our teammates on a more agile platform.  The base is really important. I didn't say we have a new state-of-the-art commercial ecosystem. We have a new state-of-the-art mortgage ecosystem. We have a new state-of-the-art digital platform. All of those in my mind are opportunity costs. So those are things we don't have to invest in disproportionately going forward, and they create the opportunity to expand and add to as we go into the next few years.  The other part of that is something we call the digital straddle. This thing that we did to convert our clients digitally, I think, is actually fairly unique. And what that allows us to do again, from an agility standpoint, is to leverage that back-end platform, and through the use of APIs and the straddle, we can do a whole lot more for our clients than we could before. So when the hood is up, we've been looking at virtually everything.  The hood-up and the best of both mentality has allowed us to not only expand and create a better ecosystem, but I also look at it as a board of lot of opportunity cost in the future of having to do these major changes.\nMike Mayo: You said you're still committed, I guess, to low 50s efficiency. It just seems like it's been a long way, stocks underperformed since the merger was announced despite a merger on paper that has the chance to be best merger as ever, and I think part of the reason for the under performance may have been, you had the pandemic, you had the low rate s, so there are some excuses there.  But looking ahead, are you able to commit to positive operating leverage next year? Given the way -- given all these investments, you're avoiding costs, you're getting gains from the technology investments. I think it's -- investors are thinking let's see more of that digital dividend. Let's see more of that payoff. How much can you lead us or give a little bit more hope as it relates to positive operating leverage?\nBill Rogers: Maybe I have that a little more than hope. No, I think it's totally reasonable to expect us to have positive operating for next year in the middle of this merger. And that's against investments we want to make. That's overcoming inflation. That's overcoming all the other things that exist: rate, environment, pandemic, all those type things.  Now, we're committed to having a business that has positive operating leverage and has industry-leading efficiency. There's no -- I feel more confident about that today than I did the day we announced the merger. It's sometimes hard to peel back the Clouds in the merger costs, in the one-times, and all of that to see that. But the underlying capacity of our Company to deliver a positive operating leverage growth on the top line and world-class efficiency is absolutely there.\nMike Mayo: All right. Next year, positive operating leverage and debt, you're committed to that. And this is your first earnings call as the CEO. Did I hear that correctly?\nBill Rogers: That is absolutely what will be in our plan for next year.\nMike Mayo: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: All right. Next, we'll go to John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Morning, Daryl. I just want to clarify the outlook for net interest income next quarter. I think you said on a reported basis down 1% on a core net interest income flattish. Just clarify if that was the guide and then how does that set you up more broadly for growing NII into 2022 when you think about all the puts and takes there.\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So you are correct. We will have stable NII on the core basis in the fourth quarter. We'll be down 1% just because of purchase accounting, accretion. As '22 plays out -- when I look at '22, as we put this together, the three break drivers of NI, the impacts will be loan growth, deposit growth depending on how large the balance sheet gets and how much liquidity we invest, and then interest rates.  When I look at all that, I think it's very possible that -- I'm very sure that the core [Indiscernible] income will grow. I think we have a chance of having an offset overall that run-off of purchase accounting. It doesn't take a huge amount of loan growth coupled with a Fed move, that's not in the implied right now.  But even as steepening of the yield curve would add. If you just steepen the yield curve like 25 basis points, that would give us another 100 million in for the year next year. I think there's a lot of variables that could play out, but we feel pretty good that trajectory of core mar -- net interest margin will rise in '22, and that our reported net interest margin should be relatively stable if we can offset that.\nJohn McDonald: And Bill, just a bigger picture question in terms of the capital target and what you need to run the Company. You brought down the capital target CET1 to 975. It seems like you'll get there with the Service Finance acquisition soon. So longer-term, what will be the factors as you think about lowering that capital to maybe something closer to what shares that look like you target on CET1?\nBill Rogers: And, John, remember we also announced we'll do some more share repurchase this quarter to get there faster. We've said all along and we went into the merger with a little bit of a higher capital base, very intentionally. And what we said was, as the risk of the merger decreases and the solid definition of the economy increases, we have a Company that has a lower-than-average risk profile and a higher-than-average PPNR profile.  I think we will start thinking about capital positions that reflect that. We don't want to do this on a quarter-by-quarter basis. This is sort of a long-term strategy and philosophy. But this weekend was a good milestone for us in terms of reducing the risk of the merger and our confidence at where we are in the first part of next year.  We'll get that behind us, and we'll continue to evaluate where we are from a capital standpoint. No reason to think we are going to change the profile of our Company, our diversifications, our risk profile is going to stay strong, and we're confident in the PPR components of the growth in our business.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. Great. Not quarter-to-quarter, but getting through the conversions will be a big factor as you think about lowering that target over time.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. I think we've got to be in the first part of next year to have another conversation about this, but we're going to be thoughtful in moving to the existing target quickly.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. Thank you. Ankur Vyas: Allen, that completes our call. Thanks everybody for joining. We appreciate it. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. We hope everybody has a great day. We appreciate your interest in Truist. Allen, you can now disconnect.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And once again, everyone that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, Ankur. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I hope everyone's well and safe. I'm very pleased by Truist continued progress on our solid third-quarter performance. Our quarterly results reflect the diversity of our business mix, which drove strong fee income and helped overcome continued softness in net interest income. Credit quality was outstanding, resulting another provision benefit. Loan growth was modest, excluding PPP, generally in line with our expectations. We also achieved a major integration milestone this past weekend, and we'll share more details on these topics during the presentation. If I move you to slide 4, I'd like to begin with our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We believe our purpose-driven culture is the primary factor behind our success as a Company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions. A recent example of this was our decision to remain open during our conversion last Saturday, so we could care for our clients and address any questions. To my knowledge, that's the first for a major systems conversions such as ours. I've said in our culture, purpose, performance, teamwork, and a client-first mindset, all coexist, and there's no better evidence of that than the extraordinary success our teammates delivered this past weekend in our most significant merger milestone to-date, details of which I'll cover shortly. Slide 5 describes how we're living out our purpose and highlights some of the notable progress we've made during the quarter. During the pandemic, philanthropic giving was a natural way to put our purpose into action due to the effects of the coronavirus on our clients, teammates, and communities. Our purpose is much broader than philanthropy. We developed this slide around major themes contained in our CSR and ESG report because they're the topics that are most important to all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. I won't cover every point on the slide. Let me just highlight a few. We continue to make strong progress against our $60 billion community benefits plan, currently a 112% of target, including the ongoing impact that Truist Community Capital provides our communities with regards to affordable housing, access to healthy food and education, and investments and job creation in small business. Truist and [Indiscernible] announced that all elementary school students nationwide will soon have access to workforce universe, a digital early literacy program. I'll talk more about this shortly, but we've migrated 7 million clients to the new Truist digital banking experience, which includes enhanced digital investment, money management capabilities, personalized insights, and a holistic personal financial management tool. We committed to increase diversity in our senior leadership roles to at least 15% by 2023. We're currently at almost 14%, and clearly on track. Importantly, long-term, the way we create a more diverse senior leadership organization is by recruiting diverse early talent and then developing, retaining, and promoting over time. And for early career program hiring in 2021, 64% of the seats at Truist were filled by diverse candidates. All of this progress combined with enhanced disclosures has resulted in solid improvements in our ESG scores. Lastly, in a few weeks we'll release our inaugural Truist TCFD report. Our teammates and I are very proud of Truist and all the ways we deliver on our purpose. So turning to the third quarter performance highlights on Slide 7, we earned $1.6 billion or $1.20 earnings-per-share for the quarter on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, we earned 1.9 billion or $1.42 -- $1.42 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 46% versus the same quarter last year, and is largely driven by the provision benefit. Sequentially, EPS declined 8% as we had a greater benefit from the provision last quarter and seasonally stronger revenues last quarter. We had strong returns, including a 22.6 adjusted ROTCE. Excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still very good, north of 19%. Revenues totaled $5.6 billion, fairly stable compared to last quarter. On an adjusted basis, year-over-year revenue growth was 2% as much stronger fee income offsets in almost 30 basis point decline in margin, and 8% decline in loans, a reflection of this unique environment that we're all in. The stronger adjusted fee income which grew 12% compared to a year ago, did drive slightly higher expenses than expected, but our PPNR is broadly in line with our expectations. Asset quality continues to be an excellent story, as we outperformed our net charge-off guidance with lower charge-offs across C&I combined with strong recoveries. During the quarter, we were pleased to increase the dividend 7%, and we completed the Constellation acquisition, which had a very good first quarter with Truist Insurance. Also, we announced the strategic acquisition of Service Finance, which will close later this year. Daryl will share some additional information on service finance, but it's broadly a reflection of Truist skating to where the puck is going, and partnering with a leader in home improvement point-of-sale lending. We also completed our retail mortgage origination conversions and benefits, which Daryl will also highlight later. Last but certainly not least, I'm very excited to report, this past weekend, we completed a major phase of our Core Bank conversion. After a lot of intense, deliberate, thoughtful, and purposeful preparation by our team, we were able to stand up the Truist technology ecosystem and migrate all heritage BB&T Retail Wealth and Business clients to it. Event went extremely well and there are number of notable positive impacts for clients and teammates. Starting this past Tuesday, over 2500 heritage BB&T &T teammates were able to log onto the new Truist commercial lending ecosystem for the first time. Because of the conversion, the Salesforce client management and sales pipeline system is now directly connected to the Encino lending origination system, which allows for better communication and workflow across the deal team, and visibility or progress of the loan all in one place. These upgrades also lay the foundation for future digital innovation. We're now able to offer Truist products to new clients and to heritage BB&T clients through our branches and digitally through t ruist.com, including our new Truist Ready Now Loan, a small dollar lending solution for existing clients to cover emergency financing needs between $100 and $1000, consistent with our belief on the importance of emergency savings. We upgraded our ATM, contact center, and digital payment capabilities across a number of dimensions, including more client self service, improved authentication, and operational simplification. While this was not a physical branding event, the conversion places us on excellent footing for the final conversion in the first quarter of 2022 when heritage SunTrust clients will transition to the Truist ecosystem and all branches will become Truist. Again, I want to congratulate our teammates on a job well done. They've prepared with intensity and purpose for multiple quarters. They learned and applied lessons from previous conversion work. They worked non-stop this past weekend, and delivered a seamless conversion. I really could not be more proud. Now, going to Slide 8. We have 3 significant items that negatively affected earnings during the quarter. First, merger charges totaled 132 million after-tax, lower than last quarter, because higher Voluntary Separation and Retirement Program costs were reflected in the second quarter. This VSRP program is one of the many components of our overall cost-saving goal. Approximately, half of our 2,000 teammates who elected to participate left on September 30th, and I cannot thank them enough for their long-standing efforts to build the foundation of Truist by helping create 2 amazing companies in BB&T and SunTrust, and then helping bring Truist to life during our almost first 2 years of existence. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger were 147 million after-tax. As a reminder, these are merger-related expenses but don't meet the technical definition of a merger-related and obstruction charges, will not be part of our run rate in 2023 and beyond. Also, we had a one-time professional fee accrual that met our disclosure and adjustment threshold, totaling 23 million after-tax. This fee was incurred to develop an ongoing program to identify, prioritize, and road map [Indiscernible] generated revenue growth and expense saving opportunities as part of the merger and beyond. This helps ensure that we'll achieve our 2022 cost save targets. It's also fuel for creating more capacity for investments in the future, will also improve the client experience, simplify our processes, and create a more engaged and energized workforce. Our teammates generated more than 50,000 -- 5,000 initial ideas, which we consolidated and narrowed down to approximately 1,000, and we're building the execution plan. Ultimately, our goal is for this to be an ongoing way of how we do business at Truist, and powering our teammates to identify and execute on ideas to improve our Company. The total impact on these 3 items was $0.22 per share. Moving to slide 9, as we've noted, Truist is the first large merger in the digital age, so we're highly focused on ensuring a smooth transition for our digitally active clients. Our new Truist digital experience for Flex 2 of our core digital and technology principles; co-creation with our clients and failing fast to learn fast. We built this new platform based directly on clients feedback, and we're introducing it in waves, learning from each release and getting better every time. We made great progress in the third quarter, inviting approximately 7 million retail wealth and small business clients to migrate to the Truist digital experience through September. But half of those clients have started and use the platform in lieu of their heritage app. By the end of this quarter, our goal is to migrate all digital clients to the Truist digital platforms. We've received ongoing feedback from our clients on incorporated opportunities for improvement iteratively over the course of the migration, which has resulted in an improved client experience over time. This de-risk our Core Bank conversion and makes Truist the first to de-link the front-end conversion from the back-end. A patented approach we can leverage for future back-end innovation. As you can see on Slide 10, we continue to experience healthy demand for digital banking services as our clients look for more convenient and effective ways to transact and manage their finances. The pace of digital adoption has been especially rapid in mobile. Active mobile users and Zelle transactions are up 11% and 58% respectively, year-over-year. Last quarter, I highlighted that we are creating a common core digital architecture and platform for retail wealth and small business clients, which creates agility and seamless client experiences, yet ones that are tailored and designed for the unique needs of each client segment. For our wealth clients, we provide a differentiated digital client experience that reflects their relationship with Truist. An integrated platform will provide a one-stop-shop for their holistic financial picture, including a unified investment portfolio experience that is agnostic to whether the account is a trust or brokerage account, holistic financial planning with external account aggregation, and the ability to secure, store, and exchange documents for their advisor, and the same access to low cost digital and automated investing that we now offer retail clients. Turning to slide 11, on an absolute basis, loans declined 2.4 billion sequentially. However, if you exclude the impact of PPP forgiveness, average loans increased 1.6 billion or 2.3% annualized consistent with our outlook. When you peel back the onion, there's some good trends, but we also have headwinds. PPP declined $4 billion on average in the quarter, and Dealer Floor Plan declined an additional billion. We expect PPP to decline an additional 2 billion or so on average in the fourth quarter. Dealer utilization is about 25%, well below historical averages. We've been somewhat cautious in CRE, although we're beginning to see opportunities in that space that meet our risk appetite and portfolio diversity objectives. Even so, that portfolio declined 1.2 billion sequentially. Excluding these items, Commercial Loans increased 1.1 billion or 0.9% sequentially. So we're seeing some improved momentum, More banking regions are experiencing core C&I growth. Pipelines in the Commercial Community [Indiscernible] and CRE businesses continue to grow. And our revolver exposure also grew 2% sequentially. Evidence of our relevance that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion. Big picture, our corporate and commercial clients remain optimistic, but labor shorter -- shortages of supply chain issues are affecting their businesses no different than Truist. Net-net, we believe there is meaningful upside to the C&I growth story as the economy continues to improve, pandemic-related disruption subside, and the liquidity-related distortions from ongoing government stimulus abate. But the timing of all this is difficult to predict. On the consumer slide, mortgage has shifted from a shrinking to a growing portfolio, reflecting increased operational capacity, slower prepaid speeds, and our tactical decision to balance sheet correspondent production. We're also seeing good performance with indirect auto, Light Stream, [Indiscernible] and credit card, all of which are growing versus last quarter. So turning to slide 12, we added this slide, this quarter to broad a little more color on growth in headwinds for average loans since there are several significant moving pieces. Long-term loan growth as an output and a highly correlated economic growth, which we believe is on firm footing, particularly in our markets. We also continue to pursue tactics and strategies to capture more than our fair share of loan growth within our risk appetite diversification objectives, including deepening our lending relationships with our wealth clients, increasing our digital and point-of-sale lending capabilities, and expanding our wallet share within certain corporate and commercial clients. Turning to slide 13. Average deposits increased 6.5 billion or 1.6% compared to the second quarter, largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus. More importantly, Truist continues to resonate with clients. We continue to make solid progress with quality account growth. Year-to-date, our net new personal DDA accounts grew almost 50,000 significantly higher than last year. Net new business DDA is up 11% year-over-year. In addition, client attrition from closed branches continues to be very low. This performance reflects excellent execution by our retail Community Bank teammates. And with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail. Thanks Daryl. Slide 25 provides an overview of our value proposition. Made the details, obviously we've shared in the past. But flipping to slide 26 that provides some performance highlights that support our value proposition with actual performance this quarter. Our markets continue to have strong in-migration, the data of which can lag, fee income from insurance investment banking and wealth was up 20% year-over-year, and up approximately a billion dollars compared to 2019. our third-quarter results clearly reflect the potential for profitability levels to be industry leading as we come out of the merger. Lastly, we continue to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders, and we'll have that capacity to do more over time as integration risk subside and the economy stays on sound footing. So in conclusion, the effects of the pandemic are moderate, economy is getting better. We are one major step away from completing our integration process. We're beginning to shift from a more defensive to a more offensive position and from a merger focus to performance focus. We fully believe that Truist best days are ahead. So with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you and Q&A. Morning. Ankur Vyas: Morning Yeah. Betsy, it's a great question. As Daryl mentioned, we didn't model any of that into the basic models. The basic model you saw is for the Service Finance as a standalone. One of the really attractive parts of this integration for Truist, it was the fact that they've developed relationships with 14 thousand contractors, 180 manufacturers, just so to think about that in context or 80 manufacturers, think about that in context, many of those which are existing clients of Truist.  We've got this incredible opportunity to expand those relationships, they are adding a lot of new clients to our base who are single-product clients, who we got an opportunity to expand using things like Light Stream and the capabilities that we have there using the prowess of our CIB bankers with the manufacturers, helping expand with the contractors. There's a whole another component to service finance, which is really interesting as the whole ESG Ps of what they're doing to create more energy efficiency, and the concept of just everything related to home improvement.  What we really like about service finance, it's a pure-play on the home side. If you think about all of the things that we have related to home. Think about insurance that we have related to home, think about home equity, think about mortgage, think about all the prowess and product and capabilities we have related to home.  We're just starting to explore those kind of opportunities. This is why we feel so good about this. This to us is where the buck's going, as I said, versus where it is. And to your question, I think those are significant opportunities ahead of us. Yeah, just on the standalone. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Thanks for that addition, Daryl. But I think to that question, Ryan, that's the focus. I mean there are tons of puts and takes, but we're going to hit the expense targets that we committed to. I mean I feel very, very confident about that, and have a business that creates positive operating leverage and industry-leading efficiency.  That's the shift and the target that we're headed to. I didn't mean to imply that they weren't green shoots, I still think there are definitely green shoots, and I think they manifested themselves in this quarter, as we highlighted. When I think about loan growth as an output, output, I look at production pay downs, utilization, and pipelines selling those 4 elements and then try to see where they're going. On the production side, we're hitting some high points in the quarter for C&I and consumers, our production is strong.  Paydowns stayed pretty consistent. Paydowns are about where they have been. Utilization is still pretty flat, you could say grinding up in certain areas, but in fairness probably pretty flat. But pipelines are strong. In CIG and CRE and CCB for us, we're at high points for the last several quarters in pipelines. So it's hard to guide. If I said, view it as medium-term X PPP, I think low single-digit growth is at the forefront.  But our positioning sort of longer-term when liquidity comes out of this, I just feel great about our -- great about our positioning, and our capacity to -- we've grown our revolvers, so our utilization going up, the fantastic markets we're in, the business investments that we've made and talent, the consumer businesses as you pointed out, point-of-sale businesses, things that are just adding capabilities and adding more opportunity for us to capture growth as we go forward.  So I -- so yes, I think there are green shoots, hard to predict when they're going to grow. But I feel really, really good about how we're positioned. Morning. Yeah. I'd say first, as Core Truist, I think the biggest opportunity is with Truist. I see the biggest opportunity to actualize and optimize the opportunity that came from this fantastic merger vehicle, so let me say that, as it's primary where we are going. But then the bolt-on, clearly on the insurance side.  I mean, we've had a fantastic track record on the insurance side. It is a really good toggle between organic and inorganic growth and managed well, and I would expect that to continue. Maybe other things that look around and bolt-on that are important to us strategically and add some scale; We've been adding a lot of talent. I view that as the equivalent of an acquisitions, so we've been adding talent and you see the benefits of that, for example, in the investment -- in the investment banking side.  But I think if you [Indiscernible], bolt-on and the places where we've -- where we're experienced or where we have opportunity, and then primary emphasis on Truist and maximizing and optimizing this merger. Good morning. Yeah, I would start with industry-leading efficiency. So let me start without the concept. I think given some normalization and rates, I feel really confident in the low 50s. But most importantly, being able to achieve positive operating leverage, being able to be industry-leading top or top quartile efficiency, I think, is imminently short, medium, and long-term achievable for Truist. Yeah. The great thing, Matt, is we have an incredibly strong, skilled, experienced, purposeful team. So I'm really fortunate to be surrounded by really great leaders. As you noted, we didn't want to put a lot of change in place because actually I feel really good about the momentum and where things are going.  So the leaders who were responsible for those businesses, we shifted a couple of things around, but they still have the primary responsibility that they had before. I'd say the shift though is more -- what I talked about in my opening statements, it's more of a transition from merging to operating.  That doesn't have anything to do with me or anything. It just has to do with the timing of where we are in those process. Getting this merger -- major conversion this weekend was just a shot of adrenaline for us, to be fair. I mean, that's a big significant milestone for us. And just gives us more confidence to be starting to shift some of our time, some of our responsibility, some of our focus to maximizing the opportunities that are true.  So I would say, if I were to describe the transition and what it feels may be different now, is that -- it's more of that. And I just think that's a function of timing and where we are and our confidence building. Yeah. Mike, it's a great question. And I think about it in two ways, one digital dividend as you put it, but also the avoidance of opportunity cost. And that's really what's happening with this merger. So if you think about it in the core basis, we're creating a much more agile platform; so the ability to move fast, to add, to create more opportunities for our clients, our teammates on a more agile platform.  The base is really important. I didn't say we have a new state-of-the-art commercial ecosystem. We have a new state-of-the-art mortgage ecosystem. We have a new state-of-the-art digital platform. All of those in my mind are opportunity costs. So those are things we don't have to invest in disproportionately going forward, and they create the opportunity to expand and add to as we go into the next few years.  The other part of that is something we call the digital straddle. This thing that we did to convert our clients digitally, I think, is actually fairly unique. And what that allows us to do again, from an agility standpoint, is to leverage that back-end platform, and through the use of APIs and the straddle, we can do a whole lot more for our clients than we could before. So when the hood is up, we've been looking at virtually everything.  The hood-up and the best of both mentality has allowed us to not only expand and create a better ecosystem, but I also look at it as a board of lot of opportunity cost in the future of having to do these major changes. Maybe I have that a little more than hope. No, I think it's totally reasonable to expect us to have positive operating for next year in the middle of this merger. And that's against investments we want to make. That's overcoming inflation. That's overcoming all the other things that exist: rate, environment, pandemic, all those type things.  Now, we're committed to having a business that has positive operating leverage and has industry-leading efficiency. There's no -- I feel more confident about that today than I did the day we announced the merger. It's sometimes hard to peel back the Clouds in the merger costs, in the one-times, and all of that to see that. But the underlying capacity of our Company to deliver a positive operating leverage growth on the top line and world-class efficiency is absolutely there. That is absolutely what will be in our plan for next year. And, John, remember we also announced we'll do some more share repurchase this quarter to get there faster. We've said all along and we went into the merger with a little bit of a higher capital base, very intentionally. And what we said was, as the risk of the merger decreases and the solid definition of the economy increases, we have a Company that has a lower-than-average risk profile and a higher-than-average PPNR profile.  I think we will start thinking about capital positions that reflect that. We don't want to do this on a quarter-by-quarter basis. This is sort of a long-term strategy and philosophy. But this weekend was a good milestone for us in terms of reducing the risk of the merger and our confidence at where we are in the first part of next year.  We'll get that behind us, and we'll continue to evaluate where we are from a capital standpoint. No reason to think we are going to change the profile of our Company, our diversifications, our risk profile is going to stay strong, and we're confident in the PPR components of the growth in our business. Yeah. I think we've got to be in the first part of next year to have another conversation about this, but we're going to be thoughtful in moving to the existing target quickly."

            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 14, net interest income was down slightly versus prior quarter. This was consistent with our guidance and reflected two competing factors. Purchase accounting accretion decreased 53 million [Indiscernible] quarter, and contributed 23 basis points to reported margin, down from 28 basis points in the second quarter. However, core non-interest income increased 41 million. This was driven by a larger investment portfolio, which resulted in strong deposit growth. We have more than offset lower PPP revenue. Core net interest margin decreased two basis points due to higher liquidity and lower PPP revenue. We expect to earn an additional 125 million in PPP revenues over the coming three quarters and for the balance to be demonyms by mid-2022. We continue to be asset-sensitive. We estimate that 100 basis point ramp increase would increase Nii by 4.1%. A 100 basis point shock would increase NII by 7.9%. We're also well-positioned to benefit from rising rates, at both the short and long end of the curve. 2/3 of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end, and it assumes a deposit beta of approximately 50%. In reality, we have experienced, over the last few years ago, deposit betas are likely to be significantly lower than our modeled assumptions when the first few rate hikes. For every 10% decline in deposit beta, our asset sensitivity increases by about 100 basis points. Moving to Slide 15. As Bill highlighted, we had a very strong quarter from a fee income perspective. Fee income, excluding security gains from last year, was up a very strong 12% like quarter exceeding our initial expectations. Insurance income increased 25% in total. This was due to acquisitions and also a very strong 12% organic growth. Investment banking at its best -- had its second-best quarter and record M&A performance. M&A results like this do not come in a vacuum, they're results of years of investment and commitment to our clients. Capital markets earn revenue was up 22% year-to-date. Growth remains very strong up 10% compared to a year ago as a result of market conditions but also positive asset flows. [Indiscernible] -related income was down after its record second-quarter performance, but momentum continues to be positive. Residential Mortgage was down [Indiscernible] quarter due to lower refinance activity. However, it increased 62 million sequentially, primarily due to better servicing income due to lower prepayment speeds and the addition of a new servicing portfolio. Production income also improved sequentially as we restored capacity after temporary reducing it last quarter. Other income of 131 million was also another high-water mark, largely due to valuation gains related to our SBIC funds. Our non-qualified plan continues to have positive valuation adjustments and we have now included the details of both the non-qualified plan and CVA in our earnings release tables. Turning to expenses on Slide 16. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.4% sequentially compared to our guidance of a relatively flat. Drivers included higher-than-anticipated fee income, which pushed incentives above our forecast, in addition to 32 million cost from the non-qualified plan. Excluding the effects of these items, adjusted expenses were only slightly above our expectations. On an absolute basis, adjusted non-interest expense increased primarily due to higher planned marketing costs, as we continue to build our brand awareness, as well as higher technology costs which are reflected in software and equipment expense. Moving to Asset quality on Slide 17. Asset Quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diversified portfolio, favorable economic conditions, and the effects of stimulus. Our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points, a pro forma post-financial crisis well. Leading indications -- indicators remain strong as MPLc and early-stage delinquencies remain low. Our AOOO coverage ratio decreased to 1.65% as the economic scenarios continue to improve, and -- but still remains above our CSO day one level 1.54%. We also had a provision benefit of 324 million. Continuing on slide 18, capital remains strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1% was above our near-term. 9.75% target. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter due to the effects of the recent acquisition activity. We have approximately 1 to 2 billion of potential capital deployment remaining through the third quarter of 2022. We expect to consume approximately 500 million of this capacity via share repurchases in the fourth quarter, reflecting our own capital position, reduced integration risks on the heels of very successful integration event we discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 19, we provide additional details about Service Finance. We continue to be very excited about Service Finance, and the acquisition is on track to close later this year. Service Finance is strategically attractive because it expands the scale and capabilities of our existing point-of-sale businesses, which is where the consumer preferences are shifting. In addition, we believe home improvement is in a secular growth phase, and the professional financing market is highly fragmented. Service Finance is the perfect partner for Truist, given its proven track record of business development and growth, its exclusive focus on home improvement, strong digital client experience, and excellent reputation in the marketplace. From a financial perspective, we have provided a few additional details to help you model the transaction. The vast majority of Service Finance revenue will come in net interest income. The NII is a mix of consumer interest income, and discounts provided by the merchants. Loan yields are in the high single-digits from a run rate perspective, though initially they are somewhat lower due to the impact of promotional period on an unseasoned loan portfolio. We expect production to grow at a fast pace over the coming years. We expect to allocate 1.1 billion to goodwill and 700 million to intangibles. We also expect to capture approximately 250 million in value over time from a step-up in tax basis. On a standalone basis, the acquisition is 4% GAAP dilutive in year 1. Half of this dilution is driven by the utilization of capital in lieu of share repurchases. The other half is driven by the first-year GAAP net income contribution. Earning streams take time to build as we transition from an originate-to-sell to an originate-to-hold model. But over the long term, it is extremely profitable and accretive to all of our KPIs. We did not model any future revenue synergies, but see many opportunities for better leverage, our combined capabilities, and accelerate our revenue and growth potential. We have terminated third-party partnerships with certain point-of-sale financing providers. The impact of this is 2 billion of runoff will begin in early 2022. Moving to the integration update on Slide 21. As Bill highlighted, we achieved a major milestone this past weekend with successful migration of our heritage BB&T retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem. Another milestone in the quarter was completing the migration of our Truist retail mortgage origination platform. Turning to slide 22, we are committed to achieving 1.6 billion of net cost saves, and continue to make progress in each of the five categories. Third-party spend is down 11.2% from the baseline levels, exceeding our targeted reduction at 10%. We closed 39 branches during the third quarter, bringing the cumulative closures to 413. We're still on track to achieve approximately 800 total closures by the first quarter of 2022. We are also 7/8 of the way towards our non-branch facility reduction target, which will likely have more reductions to come in 2022. Average FTEs are down 11% since the merger, excluding the acquisitions. We expect further declines in FTEs in the coming quarters to the -- due to the VSRP program, where the first quarter-wave of departures began on September 30th. Technology sales will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in 2022. We have also noted areas where we continue to make critical investments, including digital technology, talent, and acquisitions in select business lines. Turning to Slide 23, we still expect to incur total merger costs of approximately 4 billion through 2022. We have incurred cumulative merger costs of approximately 3 billion through the third quarter, reflecting a considerable integration work on Slide 21. We continue to expect these costs to decrease after the first quarter of final bank conversion and then drop off entirely after 2022. Continuing on Slide 24. Core non-interest expense was just over 3 billion in the third quarter. As a reminder, this calculation removes the effects of higher variable compensation due to fee income and corporate performance since 2019. Asset value changes in our retirement plan and acquisitions since the merger of equals. As a result, Core non-interest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time of the merger closed. Based on the trajectory of ongoing cost-save initiatives, we are on track to achieve the fourth quarter Core expense target. I will now provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Reported net interest margin is expected to decrease 5 to 7 basis points, with half attributable to lower purchase accounting and accretion, and the other half due to increased liquidity and less PPP revenue. We expect reported net interest income to decline 1% sequentially, entirely due to lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest income is expected to be stable. Fee income, excluding the non-qualified plan, is expected to be largely stable from the third quarter as strength of insurance, investment, banking, wealth, and CRE, is offset by lower mortgage revenue and lower SBIC valuation gains. Adjusted non-interest expense is expected to decrease 3% to 4% from the third quarter. The primary drivers are personnel expense driven primarily by VSRP, occupancy expense, and technology cost such as software and equipment expense. For those that leverage our core expense target for the fourth quarter to build the adjusted expenses, you must add back the impact of acquisitions and higher levels of incentive compensation expense, from the higher fees and performance relative to 2019. We expect net charge-off ratio to be 20 to 30 basis points given favorable economic conditions, although we expect some normalization of these levels over time. Finally, we expect further reductions in the A-Triple low ratio, assuming economic conditions remain healthy. Given all this, Truist should have positive operating leverage next quarter when compared to the third. Now I will turn it back to Bill to conclude. Thanks, Bill. Allen, at this time, if you don't mind explaining how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to 1 primary question and 1 follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today. And what I would add to that, Betsy, is that the returns on this will be eventually over 3% ROE business, and our risk-adjusted yield will be really attractive. Annual basis. If you go back to the last rate cycle that we went to, it was basically when rates bottomed out that Fed moved up 6 times 150 basis points. If you look at the deposit betas the first probably 2 or 3 deposit betas was probably about plus or minus 20%. And then as it continued to climb, it was getting closer to 30% to 40%. I'm not sure if it ever really got to the 50% in the 6 moves that you saw there, but it gradually went up as every couple of moves happened in the last rebound with the Fed. No, I don't think we ever got to 50% beta on any even [Indiscernible]. Good morning Ryan. Yeah. We're still putting together our plan for 2022, but I'll tell you what I can tell you now. From a cost perspective, we have our 5 buckets that we talk about. We definitely will see more branch closures in the first half of 2022, with almost 400 more branches closing. They also will have more -- last corporate real estate, so more reductions in that space as 2022 comes along.  The big cost savings in technology will happen as we phase through the conversions in the first quarter, the decommissioning. We're going to reduce about 40% of the application systems and move towards from six data centers to three data centers, that will be big reductions in cost saves.  Bill talked about our continuation of our VSRP that will continue throughout in 2022. And then finally, we have that team-led synergies program to basically get synergies on expenses and revenues, and that will play out over the next couple of years. That will assure us to make sure that we get our expense targets and also give us ammunition to make more investments in digital technology and other talents. Before you start, can I finish that? From still '22 expenses, inflation is real and inflation is definitely going to be in our numbers. If you look at the last couple of years, we did not really factor our end inflation in '20 and '21. And not sure exactly what that number is, but it's probably, give or take around 2% of fee expense base.  And you also have to factor in acquisitions as well for '22, and the impact of that would have both revenue and expense. But at the end of the day we're going to have good overall operating leverage, probably top quartile when it's all said and done. Yeah. If you go back, you have to add back in incentive pieces on the acquisition pieces, as well as whatever non-qualified turns out to be, plus or minus. You probably get to -- we gave guidance on an adjusted expense number down 3% to 4% from where we are today. That is your starting off point for 2022. That's correct. Yes. So you are correct. We will have stable NII on the core basis in the fourth quarter. We'll be down 1% just because of purchase accounting, accretion. As '22 plays out -- when I look at '22, as we put this together, the three break drivers of NI, the impacts will be loan growth, deposit growth depending on how large the balance sheet gets and how much liquidity we invest, and then interest rates.  When I look at all that, I think it's very possible that -- I'm very sure that the core [Indiscernible] income will grow. I think we have a chance of having an offset overall that run-off of purchase accounting. It doesn't take a huge amount of loan growth coupled with a Fed move, that's not in the implied right now.  But even as steepening of the yield curve would add. If you just steepen the yield curve like 25 basis points, that would give us another 100 million in for the year next year. I think there's a lot of variables that could play out, but we feel pretty good that trajectory of core mar -- net interest margin will rise in '22, and that our reported net interest margin should be relatively stable if we can offset that."

And I would say for us in the industry, we had significant stimulus, the accommodation programs, and frankly strong asset values, and all of those have been tailwinds. And you saw for us almost really historic low loss point for the quarter.  So we feel really good about where we are, and given the current economic backdrop, we would certainly expect to continue to see outperformance with, to your point, a steady return over time to normalization as we go into '22 and beyond. And so I think it can go on longer. It again depends on the economics scenario.  But for us right now, I think we would believe we have an opportunity to outperform and you will see that reflected in our 4Q guidance."

Currently, all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Ankur Vyas, Truist Financial Corporation.\nAnkur Vyas: Thank you, Shannon, and good morning, everyone.

In addition Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized live and achieved webcast are located on our website. With that, I'll turn it over to Kelly.\nKelly King: Thanks Ankur, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We really appreciate your support. So, it's a really strong quarter, which reflects our diverse business mix, our consistent risk management. We did have a negative provision, and importantly, I would point out investments that we have made in insurance, investment banking, wealth and digital capabilities, and excellent progress in our conversion. As you've heard us say before, we believe culture continues to be the primary driver of our success. I will point out today and these times, our purpose really resonates with teammates and others as our purpose of inspiring and building better lives and communities is motivational and satisfying to our teammates being involved in helping make the world a better place. We're now focused, you may be interested in knowing and helping each of our teammates align with our culture on a personal basis because we find that engagement really excels when people are aligned with the personal purpose and the cultural purpose. Our EO team is highly focused on cultural integration and activation and as a primary focus for all of us. If you're following the slides, if you look on Slide 5, just want to point out that for us, purpose is not just a banner, it's the way we live. It's truly trying to inspire and build better lives and communities. We focus a lot of attention, especially now and increasing on DEI. I would point out some of the major investments we're making in our communities. For example, this quarter, we contributed a combined $200 million of Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund to support important work of our organizations across our diverse markets and communities. It's very excited that we were able to invest $22 million in Atlanta's Mercy Care, which is a fantastic federally qualified healthcare for homeless program. We expanded our partnership with Operation HOPE with a $20 million investment to help provide more education, insights, and tools to help more people build better lives. And we invest $2.5 million in a grant to the National Institute for Student Success to improve the financial education and graduation rates for underserved students. This is a fantastic program. But it's not just about philanthropy, it's about the way we live around here every day. So, I'm very proud that we released our inaugural Supplier Diversity Impact Report, which outlined a $1 billion total economic impact through supplier diversity relationships in 2020. We're at 114% prorated on our goal for our three-year $60 billion community benefit plan, which is really helping our communities. And through second quarter 2021, we've originated about $17 billion of PPP loans, which really have supported our business clients and employees and our communities. We're very active and increasing our engagement with regard to ESG. We're very focused on energy and sustainable-related financing. We're in the second quarter continuing from 2020, we've invested $2.4 billion in clean energy and sustainable-related financing. Look forward soon into next few weeks for the Second Truist CSR and ESG report, which I think you will enjoy. So now, if you flip with us to Slide 7, I just want to point out some of the key performance highlights. So, a very strong quarter. We had taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion, which was up a strong 4% sequentially from first quarter. We had $5.6 billion in taxable equivalent revenue, we had the revenue and net income was $2.1 billion, which was at 30% linked. Very proud of our $1.55 diluted EPS which was up 31% sequentially and a strong 89% over last year. Our return on average tangible common equity adjusted was a very strong 24.7%. But even if you take out the reserve release, it's still a really, really strong 20.9%, which is driven by strong performance in insurance, investment banking, wealth, card and payment fees, and our commercial real estate-related income. We had strong performance in terms of revenue. As I said, it did drive a 2% increase in adjusted non-interest expenses due to incentives, but frankly, this is exactly the kind of expense increase we like to have. When you put that together, revenue and expenses, we had a solid adjusted operating leverage of 2% and our adjusted PP&R was $2.5 billion, up 6% compared to last quarter. Our asset quality is great. We performed well in CCAR, which allowed us to be in a position to propose a 7% increase in our dividend, a record $0.48 per quarter. Our merger integration is going very, very well and top performance and improved economic conditions give us confidence to reduce our CET1 target to 9.75% and Daryl will talk more about that. So, our total performance for the quarter, we think was very, very strong and very comprehensive, which we feel very, very good about. If you'll flip with us to Slide 8, I just want to point out a few of the selected items that impacted adjusted income. First, we had merger-related and restructuring charges of $297 million, $228 million after-tax, which was a diluted impact of $0.17. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger, I'll point out again, these are merger-related expenses but don't meet the technical definition of merger-related and restructuring charges, but they're not in our run rate going forward. That's $190 million, $146 million after-tax and $0.11 diluted negative impact. As I mentioned, we did have a $200 million contribution to our Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund, which had an $0.11 impact. I would point out in the merger-related and restructuring charges, included in that is a $111 million after-tax accrual related to our voluntary separation and retirement program, which was a program that we offered in June. We had approximately 2,000 teammates that elected to participate. These were totally voluntary decisions on their part, and I want to really thank and appreciate those teammates for their commitment and support and help us build a foundation of Truist. This program does help us reduce costs and create capacity to invest in needed services for our clients. It's really part of our overall intense focus on reconceptualizing our businesses. To thrive in today's world requires a deep commitment to continuously reevaluating yesterday's activities and expenses associated with that, so that we can afford to invest in new activities for today's demands. With that, let me turn it to Bill to talk about some \u2013of our key trends.\nBill Rogers: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everybody. As you can see on Slide 9, we continue to experience robust demand for digital banking services as our clients look for more convenient and more effective ways to transact and manage their finances. The pace of digital adoption has been especially wrapped and mobile. Since the second quarter of 2020, our active user base has increased by 9% to over 4.1 million active clients. Yet the digital growth stories, it's a lot more than that, isn't just one dimensional. In addition to growing active users, we're deepening our relationships as we accompany clients along their digital journey. By providing the premier digital experience, we build trust with our clients. They then entrust us to facilitate a broader range of transactions. A great example of this is in mobile payments where Zelle transactions were up 60% compared to a year ago. We're also excited about the rollout of our new digital experience that's beginning now ahead of our physical conversion. After completing a successful internal pilot, we're beginning to migrate the Truist Digital offering to a small number of clients, rollout will happen in a series of waves throughout the back half of the year. We anticipate that up to 0.5 million clients could be on the digital platform by the end of this month, with more to be added in each successive wave. On the right, you can see just one example of how we're using digital and meet clients where they are in the small business space. A single sign on focus for clients with personal and business accounts has a significant benefit, allowing our small business clients to toggle back and forth seamlessly between their business and personal finances. Our clients also be able to customize their dashboard and notifications, so they can focus on what matters to them. In addition, our fraud detection technology will help small business clients with -- from fraudulent transactions or more secure banking experience. The attractiveness of our overall approach is that we've created a common platform for retail wealth and small business, which creates agility and seamless client experiences, but the experiences are tailored and designed for the unique needs of each client segment. Now, let me move to Slide 10. Loan growth remain challenging in the second quarter given strong liquidity levels in the marketplace and amongst our clients. Supply chain disruptions and low levels of rates which are driving high levels of refinance activity. Average loans decrease $6.1 billion compared to the first quarter, driven by $3.3 billion dollar in commercial loans and a $2.2 billion decline in residential mortgages. Average C&I balances decreased $2.4 billion, reflecting a $1.3 billion impact from PPP forgiveness and $1.2 billion from lower dealer floor plan outstandings. Nevertheless, we're encouraged about potential green shoots in C&I. Excluding the impacts of PPP and dealer floorplan, C&I loans grew modestly due to an increase in production and stable utilization late in the quarter. Several of our markets and specialties saw growth, particularly middle market. June production and corporate institutional group was the highest it's been since the merger and June production in the Commercial Community Bank was the highest it's been in 18 months. If you exclude April 2020, which was obviously unusual due to elevated line draws. Our revolver exposure continued to grow by month evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building capacity for investments or expansion. Average consumer loans decreased $2.7 billion as a result of ongoing refinance activity in our residential mortgage and home equity and direct portfolios. Residential mortgages held for investment decreased $2.2 billion as prepayment speeds remained elevated despite some moderation from first quarter levels. We're expanding our correspondent capacity and transferring some correspondent production to hold for investment to support future growth. We also believe prepayment speeds will continue to moderate. Indirect remains a bright spot due growth in our prime marine RV portfolios and Lightstream. Overall, loan growth remained elusive in the second quarter, both for the industry and for Truist. As indicated earlier, we're seeing evidence of things beginning to turn and our execution is improving at Truist with a keen focus on balance sheet diversity and prudent risk management. Long-term long growth as an output and highly correlated economic growth and we firmly believe the economy, particularly in our key markets, is on a very solid footing and on an expansion trajectory. Let me turn to Slide 11. Average deposits increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter, largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus. We experienced strong deposit inflows while maximizing our value proposition to clients outside of rate paid as average total deposit costs decreased one basis point sequentially to four basis points. More importantly, Truist continues to resonate with clients. During the second quarter, we had a record personal checking account production and added more than 51,000 net new accounts which attests to the strength of our franchise. We're also doing an excellent job retaining clients as attrition rates from recently closed branches continue to be significantly more favorable than plant. We believe these favorable client dynamics reflect our robust markets, strong digital commerce, production, and solid execution by our teammates in the retail community bank. And with that Darryl, let me turn it over to you for our financial performance.\nDaryl Bible: Thank you and good morning everyone. Continuing on Slide 12, net interest income decreased $40 million, largely due to $32 million lower purchase accounting accretion. Net interest margin decreased 13 basis points are purchase counting accretion was four basis points headwind. Core net interest margin decreased nine basis points due to the continued build of excess liquidity, which was approximately $18 billion this quarter as well as the impact of persistent low rate environment. Asset sensitivity increased modestly due to the increase in DDA and the favorable deposit mix changes, partially offset by the increase in the investment portfolio. I would also know almost 60% of our assets sensitivity is from the short end of the curve, given a solid upside when short-term rates begin to rise. Our diverse business mix is a key strength and continues to provide revenue momentum and a low rate environment. Adjusted non-interest income grew 11% sequentially and 13% year over year, driven by record results in multiple feed businesses. Insurance income was a record $690 million driven by strong organic growth and new business, excellent retention rates, and a firm pricing market. Organic revenue grew 15% versus a COVID impacted light quarter. And we continue to forecast very healthy organic growth. Given the various uncertainties that exist in the marketplace, this is clearly a good time to be in a business that helps clients manage risk. Fee income from investment banking, reflected strong results, and syndicated finance and M&A, raw trading income was offset by $60 million swing and the CVA. We have been consistently investing in and building our corporate and investment banking business for over 15 years and this quarter's results are a reflection of that. Record CRE income was driven by strong structured real estate transaction activity. Our strong performance is also a testament to the CRA teams experience and deep client relationships. Other income benefited from valuation gains on our long standing partnerships related to our SBIC funds and also investments we've made through our Truist Ventures unit. When small businesses win, our communities win. So, we are thrilled with the success we have had over many years with our SBIC program. Continuing on Slide 14, interest expense increased $401 million from the prior quarter. Drivers included a $200 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund to support our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. In addition, merger-related restructuring charges an incremental operating expenses increased $171 million, largely due to the voluntary separation and retirement program that Kelly mentioned earlier. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.1% modestly due to higher variable compensation related to the stronger performance of our fee businesses and overall strong corporate performance. Adjusted non-interest expense was also favorable relative to adjusted revenue growth driving sequential positive operating leverage this quarter. Turning to Slide 15, asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio as well as a stronger economy. Non-performing assets decreased two basis points. Net charge offs decreased 13 basis points to 20 basis points, a pro forma post financial crisis low. Lower charge offs reflect improvements in our indirect auto and C&I portfolios as well as an uptick in recoveries. Our ALLL remained strong at 1.79% with excellent coverage ratios. Due to the improved economic outlook, our provision was a negative $434 million and we released $560 million of reserves. Continuing on Slide 16. Capital remained strong. Our CET ratio increased to 10.2%. Our total payout ratio was 78% and included 610 million of share repurchases. We continue to optimize our capital stack by redeeming our Series H preferred stock. Our latest CCAR results reflect our prudent risk management and resiliency under stress. Truist had the second lowest loss rate in our peer group, as well as above average stress PP&R relative to peers. Our preliminary stress capital buffer was reduced to 2.5% from 2.7%. Our strong CCAR results, improving economy, and merger progress provide additional capital flexibility. Our Board will consider proposal to increase the dividend by 7% to $0.48 per share in its July meeting. We also intend to manage to approximately 9.75% CET1 ratio over the near-term, which would reflect approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of potential capital deployment, either through repurchases or acquisitions over the next five quarters. Turning to Slide 18, we are making steady progress in our integration plan, and our risk profile improves with each conversion. During the second quarter, we successfully converted our Wealth Truist platform. We are very proud of our wealth, digital, and technology teammates for their hard working completing this conversion and brokerage platform conversion in February. More impressively, our advisors continue to produce positive net organic asset flows, which combined with strong market conditions, produced excellent results in wealth management fee income. We also performed extensive testing to prepare for the upcoming core bank conversions. After each milestone, we reflect on what we've learned, apply those learnings to the future integration activities. This reduces the risk and helps us ensure we get better with each step of the integration. As we look to the third quarter, much of our focus will be on the final preparations for the conversion of our heritage BB&T clients to the Truist ecosystem later this year. This will be followed by heritage SunTrust conversion in the first quarter of 2022. Continuing on Slide 19, we are committed to achieving 1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress across those five categories. Third party spend is down 10.3% versus a baseline and now exceeds our revised target of 10%. And retail banking remain at 374 cumulative branch closures and are on track to achieve approximately 800 total closures by the first quarter of 2022 including 39 closures we are expecting in July. Non-branch facility space is down 3.8 million square feet and we were closing in on our target of 4.8 million. We appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track to achieve these goals. Average FTEs decreased 11% since the merger announcement would acquire even further given the WSRP program. Technology savings will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in 2022. We're also making critical investments in digital and technology. Since the merger closed, we have doubled our digital agile teams and tripled our total agile teams, which makes us nimbler and improves our speed-to-market enhancing our client experience. Turning to Slide 20. We still expect to incur a total merger cost of approximately $4 billion through 2022. We have incurred cumulative merger costs of $2.7 billion through the second quarter, reflecting considerable integration work on Slide 18. Looking ahead, we expect these cost to decrease significantly after our first quarter core bank conversion and then drop off entirely after 2022. Continuing on Slide 21, our core non-interest expense was $2.952 billion in the second quarter. This calculation removes the effects from asset value changes for our retirement plans, our insurance acquisitions, and higher variable compensation through the fee income and corporate performance. This makes it much more comparable to the baseline expenses at the time the merger closed. Based on the trajectory of our ongoing cost save initiatives. We are on track to achieve our fourth quarter core expense target of $2.94 billion. We are fully committed to this target and we are confident in our ability to meet it. Now, I provide guidance for the third quarter. We expect total net interest income to be relatively stable versus linked quarter as one additional day combined with moderate loan growth, excluding PPP, offsets declines in purchase accounting, accretion and PPP revenue. Core net interest margin is expected to be relatively stable, however, reported net interest margin will continue to decline as a result of diminishing purchase accounting accretion. These should remain healthy, given investments we've made in our businesses, robust market conditions, and continued economic recovery. They will not be as strong as second quarter performance. This is partially due to insurance seasonality, but we would expect solid growth compared to third quarter of last year. Adjusted expenses should be relatively flat linked quarter, but will decline fourth quarter as lower personnel costs are realized from the VSRP program. We expect the net charge-off ratio to be 25 basis points to 35 basis points given the continued strengthening of the economy. Also if the strong credit quality performance continues, we would expect further reductions in our loan loss allowance ratio. Overall, we had excellent operating quarter as strong fee income more than offset modest lower spread income and outpaced expenses to drive 2% sequential operating leverage. Now, let me hand it over to Kelly to discuss our value proposition.\nKelly King: Just want to make a couple of comments with regard to our value proposition this quarter focusing on our markets and capital. We are really very, very pleased that 70% of our net new accounts are opened by new households. We think this shows market share gains in migration in our markets and our digital advantage as about half of our new accounts are opened online. All of this, interestingly is happening in the face of large number of branch closures that Daryl described where client retention is a very strong 98% plus, which is really fantastic in any type of merger. As mentioned, our CCAR performance lowered risk in the economy, reduced risk in our conversion process, which Daryl discussed gives us great confidence to propose a meaningful increase in our dividend to a record $0.48 and reduce our target CET1 to 9.75%. Just wanted to emphasize that again to make sure you get that, because that's important. We also are very confident in achieving, as Daryl said, our $1.6 billion net cost saves based on a number of initiatives that are driving the reconceptualization of our business; our expense reductions and our industry-leading profitability. We believe that the combination of that will support our investments in future strategies and leading technology investments. Then finally, if you'll just flip to Slide 23, just wanted to make a couple of points that how the metrics and numbers support that value proposition. As we've said before, we have a really exceptional franchise; we have the highest projected population growth compared to our peers in our marketplaces; we have really good fee income diversity with our investments in insurance, investment banking, and wealth; we are really uniquely positioned from a profitability perspective with our adjusted diluted EPS at $1.55, up 89% adjusted return on average tangible common equity at a strong 24.7% and we have strong capital, as Daryl described as well. So, if you look at the quarter overall, it was a strong quarter based on our strong culture, great markets, awesome team. There are plenty of challenges out there, the pandemic is getting better, the economy is getting better and overall at Truist, we fully believe our best days are ahead. Ankur, we'll turn it back to you.\nAnkur Vyas: Thank you, Kelly. Before we move to Q&A though, I'd like to quickly turn it to Bill who'd like to share a few concluding thoughts.\nBill Rogers: Might make you feel a little uncomfortable, but so bear with me. So, given this is Kelly's last and 50th earnings call as CEO, I just want to spend a few minutes highlighting his legacy, just incredible positive impact on BB&T, Truist, the banking industry, and our communities during his 49-year career in banking. I could take hours to do this, but I won't given that we only have a few minutes, but I thought this group of analysts and investors would appreciate who followed his career. Kelly joined BB&T in 1972 and I thought it was great irony that earlier this week he spoke to our leadership development program, individuals, and teammates who joined just the same way you did, Kelly. When he speaks about the benefits of a growth mindset, positive thinking, choosing to be happy, and seeing opportunities and change just like he just did, he speaks from his personal experience and his heart. Kelly's humble roots give him a genuine appreciation for all people. They've driven his Seeds of Hope initiative and played a key role in our value of caring which says everyone and every moment matters. He's also the driving force with our happiness value. Positive energy changes lives and he exhibits that daily for our teammates and for our clients. Kelly became CEO in 2009 in the depths of the global financial crisis. BB&T was one of the few banks to remain profitable through every quarter through that crisis. When he began at BB&T, it was a small bank in Eastern North Carolina with about $250 million in assets. When he became CEO, the bank had a $152 billion assets, and today, Truist has $520 billion in assets. Market cap is 4 times during his tenure. Always a forward thinker, Kelly is a purpose driven leader who steered BB&T through tremendous change, not just to survive, but to thrive through the Great Recession, multiple economic downturns, and now, through a global pandemic and our merger of equals. In addition to traversing tumultuous business headwinds, I admire he's never lost sight of his personal purpose, which is to make a positive meaningful difference in the lives of as many people as possible. His empathy, compassion, and leadership had tremendous impact on just to name in fairness a few financial education for more than 1 million high school students through the Truist Financial Foundations; childhood literacy, which is a passion of his through a new reading app called WORD Force, which is just getting started; community service through the Lighthouse Project, positively impacting the lives of more than 20 million people since its inception in 2009. Kelly has always had an interest in and a commitment to leadership development. It's the foundation for the Truist Leadership Institute in Greensboro, many of you've been there. It has been renamed the Kelly S. King Center in his honor. It not only trains executives to become better and more self-aware leaders, but it also offers customized training at no cost for principals and has certified many, many students at no cost through our Emerging Leaders curriculum, which is provided in partnership with over 80 colleges and universities. Kelly is known for saying there's no facet of society that cannot be improved through better leadership. Before our merger, I knew Kelly well. I also listened to these calls Kelly, many of your 50 calls. We joined forces with a concept that we can truly build a purposeful company that stood for something better and outperformed with consistency over the long-term. Kelly, you were the perfect leader to start us on that journey. Your inspirational leadership was a positive catalyst for all of us. So, with a heartfelt thank you for your leadership, your contributions to Truist, to our industry, and personally for our friendship. I look forward to our continued partnership and collaboration with you going forward as you transition to the role of Executive Chair for our Board of Directors. So, now we can turn it over to Q&A. Kelly, thank you.\nKelly King: Can I make just one quick comment?\nBill Rogers: You're still in charge.\nKelly King: I do just want to note that this is also Daryl's 50th conference call. So, congratulations to Daryl, but thank you, Bill, for that. I just wanted to say to our audience that has supported us over all these years, it has been honor and a blessing to have worked with thousands of Truist teammates over all these years to serve our communities and I really, really cherish that opportunity. I'll also just say to all of us that banking is an honorable profession, which serves to help build better lives and communities every single day. I am humbled and proud to have been a part of it. Thank you for your support. We appreciate it and as I've said many times, I truly believe our best days are ahead.\nAnkur Vyas: Thank you, Kelly. Thank you, Bill. Shannon, at this time, we're now ready to start Q&A. So, if you'll explain to our listeners how they can participate in the Q&A session. I'd like to ask the participants to limit yourselves to one primary and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Kelly. Good morning, Bill.\nKelly King: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: To start off, on behalf of many on this call, Kelly, I would also reiterate Bill's fabulous comments about your career, and congratulate you on being an outstanding community, spiritual, and commercial bank leader. I think you will be missed by many. So congratulations. On questions, maybe starting with you, Bill, can you give us some further color or elaborate on the green shoots that you guys are seeing in the loan growth area for possibly the second half of the year, Daryl touched on in as well. And where you're seeing some of this potential growth coming from?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Sure, Gerard. As I've mentioned, production in June in CIG and CCB was sort of hitting some high points. So, we started to see a little bit an inflection point. In CIG, a lot of that came from industrials, healthcare, tech, that probably doesn't surprise you, I mean, I think as we think about that, infrastructure that's ahead of us. I think energy is a potential for the future. I'll put that a little bit of the question mark, it's probably the light green of a green chute. And CCB, really good progress in our middle market, a lot in our verticals. Senior care, I think, that's really coming back strong. Our dealer network, so we've -- despite the outstandings, our exposure dealer is going up and then just sort of our government services. Again, I don't think those are surprises. Those are pretty core parts of our economy. Overall, revolver commitments were up. So, as I said earlier, I think the capacity of our clients to invest. The -- when this will come? I think that's sort of the question. I don't think -- I think it's -- I don't think it's an \u2013 if I feel like we're in a good position, whether that manifests itself so much in the second quarter. Remember, we still have some headwinds with PPP. But our tailwinds, I think the dealer part will rebound. I mean, you'll see the supply chain start to normalize whether that happens at the end of this year or first next year, I don't know, but that will rebound. The economy, particularly in our markets utilization, and just as Kelly mentioned, our just core executions just gets better every day. So, I think those are tailwinds.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good.\nKelly King: Hey, Gerard, I would like to add. Bill and I and others have been on regional visits virtually so far this this year, and we've talked, I guess, build a hundreds of offshore business clients and feedback. And I think it's a really big deal. Universally has been extremely confident and positive. They're all talking about projects that they're working on. It is -- as Bill just dropping in and show up and reshoot, I personally think it will really begin to show up as we head in third and fourth quarter and certainly undergo a strong 2022, but the confidence level is very, very high.\nChris Henson: Gerard, this is Chris. I might just add that we had 16 of our 22 regions that were actually positive in C&I growth, less dealer this quarter.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And maybe shifting over to Daryl, you talked a little bit, Daryl, about the possibility of bringing the loan loss reserves down. You mentioned that in the DFAST tests, you're the second best in terms of on the credit losses. I see if I recall, your day one reserves back in January of 2020 were 1.61%. Can you give us maybe some color and maybe Clarke as well about the outlook that could that reserve level fall below the day one now that the outlook might be even stronger today than it was in January of 2020, excluding the pandemic situation?\nDaryl Bible: Yes, thanks for the question, Gerard. What I would tell you is that when we established our CECL day one number, we waited our pessimistic scenario of 40%. If you look at the economy now and the growth that we're seeing and outlook, our waiting is much less than that. So, as the economy plays out throughout this year, there is a chance that we could pierce through and maybe go over or go under our CECL day one number that we started with in January of 2020 from that perspective. I think you have to take a quarter-by-quarter and see how it's performing. But right now, the economy seems to be going on really strong and gaining momentum.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. You don't have revenue synergies built in your final numbers, but it seems like you might have some revenue synergies here. So, specifically, I'm asking off the record in insurance and off the record in investment banking, how much of those revenues are driven by cross-selling versus just the core organic growth? And I have my insurance analyst colleague at Wells Fargo Securities to ask on that second part, Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes. Thanks. Go ahead.\nKelly King: Go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: I was just going to build upon my question on the insurance, I'm just hoping that you guys had an impressive organic growth quarter, hoping to get an update on your outlook for the rest of the year, how things can trend versus the 15% this quarter? And how the different roles within retail and wholesale segments of the business?\nChris Henson: Right, I'd be happy to that. Maybe Bill and I will take the ERM question first and then I'll jump back and answer your question, Elyse. From ERM perspective, I will tell you it is going really well, where we have been, for the past 18 months, in the behavior building kind of phase. And when I look at this quarter, I see very strong contributions from the Commercial Community Bank to our strategic side, which is a CIG for capital market services. I see a very strong up 20% in a growth perspective, I see mortgage up in the mid-30s. And CIG, which is back to insurance and to a few other areas, up well over 100% in terms of growth. In fairness, we have some other areas that have some opportunity, but I would -- I like what I see and I think what we're building really is the right foundation for behavioral jumping off point across the company. It is something that Bill and I have been partially monitoring and working with each one of the business lines and we're in kind of still of a build-out process from the term -- from terms of understanding sort of what's possible and we're really trying to push a lot of business leaders to think bigger, because we think the opportunity is a very substantial. Bill, anything you want to add to that?\nBill Rogers: Yes, I think Chris had it exactly right. And remember, Mike, I mean, these cut across a lot of different parts and we like to think about the term of integrated relationship management. So that it cuts across clients and we're meeting clients\u2019 needs and working backwards. But just to like, give an example, sort of in a Commercial Community Bank, we doubled the number of transactions that we did in the quarter versus last quarter. And these might be where we were left lead, this might be where we were in M&A transaction. And the pipeline has also doubled where it was before. So, as a percent of the growth -- as a percent of the total, it's a smaller percent; as a percent of the incremental growth, it's a larger percent. And I think that's going to continue to grow the momentum, the cultural alignment, the -- all the parts that we've built as part of One Truist, I just feel -- I feel great about it, and that I think that momentum will continue. And you'll see it in just -- the way I think you'll see it as versus revenue synergies, specifically, what you'll see it as an incremental growth relative to others.\nChris Henson: And so coming back, Elyse, to your question, and I just preface this with comments that we took sort of a white sheet of paper to this business back in early 2018, brought in a consultant and really begin to break the business down and look at all the opportunities to put the pieces back together. I think what you're seeing here is a three-year -- end of a three-year period of where we have really taken a lot of steps to build back a business in the most effective way possible in a really good operating environment. So, I would have to say this is fundamentally the best quarter I have seen in this business in my career and I've been working on this business a long time. And we are, by the way, cranking off as we conclude the first three-year period, we're kicking off another three-year period, because we think there's more that we can do and will do to improve this business. But to get to your question, what's really driving organic growth is pricing in the industry I think probably peaked in the fourth or first quarter of fourth quarter, 2020 or first quarter this year, it was sort of in the up 7% range where we're now if you read all the industry information kind of in up, call it 6% kind of range. But we really believe while rates have moderated a little, we believe that it's still going to be very positive throughout the balance of 2021. You might have potential for a little slight moderation, but we still think it's very strong in the up category in the mid 5% to 6% kind of category. And we just entered hurricane season, by the way; in the fall was wildfire season. So, you never know, it could just hold or even increase from there depending on what happens. Our client retention in retail is at 91.8% and that's up a 1% over the last year. And in a hard market environment that favors wholesale more, that is a -- that is very much a positive. Our wholesale business is 86.1%, it's up 2%, also very strong. But we are continuing to see risk shift from the standard market that supports retail to wholesale. Probably the most notable driver of organic growth was just our new business production and that is driven just by core GDP growth. And so we're in the up portion of the V right now from an economic perspective. And so 24.5% business -- new business growth is double, the best I've seen historically, year-to-date, we're up 19%. So, we get organic growth rate -- total growth rate of 18.8%, but when you strip out acquisitions organic of 14.8%. We are including in this quarter $29 million of revenue from prior acquisitions, that does not include Constellation, which we just closed on July 1, but includes if you looked at annual run rates, it's about $130 million or prior acquisitions we did, Truist a number of seven or eight to the back half of last year and the first part of this year. So, that's sort of the organic growth question. But to get to your outlook question, just remember we're going from our seasonally strongest quarter of the year to our seasonally weakest quarter from second to third. So, we expect commissions to be down about 8% going from second to third. And there's still certainly uncertainties, but we just think the environment looking forward is still very favorable. When you think of improving economy with the GDP and improving employment, which really drives our AB business, increasing pricing, as we just said and sort of 6% range. And then we benefit from the shift to the E&S market via our very strong wholesale business because while we operate a diversified model, quite frankly. We think pricing is going to continue to be strong. You're seeing sort of the drivers in the industry this quarter. Umbrella in excess is up 11.6%, D&O is up 11%, commercial property, which we have a disproportionate exposure to is up 9.6%, that's really good for us. So, we expect for the third quarter high single-digit organic growth in our weakest quarter, that would be the highest growth that I've seen historically, period. But we're seeing -- we're expecting high single-digit growth in our weakest quarter, which I think is fantastic for the business. And just remember, we did close Constellation on July 1st and that adds %160 million in revenue and really helps us form one of the largest programs divisions in wholesale units of any wholesale provider going forward.\nMike Mayo: Great. Well, thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hey, good morning.\nKelly King: Hey.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi Chris. Just a quick follow up on that $160 million is additive so your 8% Q-o-Q is not including that acquisition, just want to just want to clarify that.\nChris Henson: No, it is in our forecast. So, what you're typically saying I mean, last year, you'd have seen second or third, we would drop maybe $75 million this year, you would have seen a $90 million drop, but with the addition of this number, you'd see something like $50 million because you've got $160 million annually.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Okay. And then just the expenses associated with Constellation that we should be thinking about anything there to -- no doubt?\nChris Henson: Now, there's expense synergies, so this business actually the margin is accretive for overall margin. So, I think there are expenses, but they're synergies that are coming out.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, great.\nDaryl Bible: I think the operating ratio initially is like 70% for Constellation, if you want to add any expenses, but the transaction. \nChris Henson: Yes, and generally Betsy -- generally, it's about a 12-month integration.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. No, you've done a great job at improving the operating efficiency of that business over the past several years. So, congratulations to you on that. I did have a couple other questions. First off, imitation is often the best form of flattery and there's a plenty of people imitating you on your specialty finance lending focus that has been a hallmark of TFC for many decades. Could you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that business and where you want to be leaning into growth?\nChris Henson: Absolutely, Betsy. Thank you for saying that. That is a -- that has been a focus of ours through our -- we really think of it in terms of point of sale. And when we talk about insurance and wealth and CIG, we probably should add sort of a point of sale focus through our core, Sheffield and you also have Live Stream, now we have a group of partnerships that are a little bit more indirect. Buying patterns have clearly changed by consumers. I no longer come to their bank to purchase their items I bought on the spot, and they want it just that way, and now they want it digitally just that way as well. So, we're working on all the above. And I think we have opportunities within our current business to expand verticals like hearing aids and do more in the way of trailers and that kind of thing. So, there are opportunities there, but I think we're also looking at other opportunities to expand like -- in the home improvement space would be a good place, there's a lot going on there. So, it's an area we're really focused on and something that we're really excited about. And it's an industry that has north of 20% kind of growth rates. So, we're very excited about the opportunity.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, thanks. And then Daryl, just a couple for you one ticky-tacky one is just on the fees, you mentioned, down sequentially. We talked about the insurance seasonality, but up year-on-year, could you just remind us what kind of base level fees you're looking at year-on-year with other some one-timers in it last year, I just want to make sure I'm on the right base?\nDaryl Bible: If you look at it versus prior year, we'll probably be up anywhere from 5% to 10% range in that neighborhood. We did have some other income in there from our venture capital portfolios there, but be honest with you, we continue to invest in that. And that continues to be part of run right as we move forward. So, it's going to be lumpy back and forth, but it is going to be continuing to grow over time from that.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then just on the NCO ratio guide of the 25% to 35%, I think it came in this quarter around 20% or so and credit looks great. So, is this you being conservative with the 25%, 35%? Or is there something in the book that you would suggest you're expecting a little bit of a deterioration Q-o-Q on the ratio?\nClarke Starnes: Betsy, this is Clarke. It's primarily seasonality. In second half of the year, we always have some seasonality uptick in some of the consumer portfolio. So, we're assuming we'll have some of that normal trend. And I would just also say this was an outstanding quarter, we did have all-time lows and things like our auto business, we had really low C&I, and higher recovery. So, we had some really strong tailwind this quarter. But all that being said, we still feel like we're going to have very strong loss performance as we move forward, given what we see today.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. And Kelly, it's been phenomenal working with you over the past several decades. So, very much appreciate the time that you spend with us and Bill, looking forward to working with you more closely going forward. Thanks.\nKelly King: Thank you, Betsy and appreciate it.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. I just want to circle back on the expense target for 4Q, the 2.94%. I guess, first clarification, does that include the impact of the insurance deals or I would assume we got to top it up for the one that just closed and maybe the others too?\nDaryl Bible: Yes, Matt. In our deck, we have that waterfall slide where we actually take our adjusted numbers and we back out three things, our non-qualified numbers we back that out. We back out insurance acquisitions and run rate because we're trying to compare back to what we looked like in 2019. And then with a huge growth that we've seen in our CIG area and our wealth area and our insurance area, just organic growth, that's great to have those revenues. But those revenues do have expenses, but those are good expenses. We're adjusting for those as well. So, that's what we're adjusting to, to try to get back to what we look like when we put the merger together in 2019.\nMatt O'Connor: Yes, that's Slide 21, or Page 21, that\u2019s very helpful. But when we see the 4Q 2021 adjustment expenses, will it be the 2.94% or we have to add that $20 million for insurance plus the one that you just did?\nDaryl Bible: Yes, it's going to be the number, the 2.94% will be the number on the right at the end of the waterfall. That's a core expense, it's not a run rate number. A run rate number is the adjusted number, which basically backs out your merger and restructuring charges, and your incremental MOE. That will tend to basically come down dramatically after the first quarter of next year when we finish our core bank conversions and go away totally by the end of 2022.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay, sorry -- so just to clarify that like, when we see the 4Q cost base, we'll take out their merger charges, we'll take out the incremental costs and should we still focus -- will we see the core number or the adjusted number?\nDaryl Bible: The adjusted number is the run rate number on a go-forward basis. All core does is basically try to back out because we're a dynamic company that's constantly changing and growing and doing things, we have to back out our expense bases that basically have benefited over the last two years of coming together. So, we're trying to show you that we're getting the 1.6% off of that original expense base by not penalizing us for the additional fee revenue growth that we received over the last couple years and acquisitions that we've done.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay, that makes sense. Sorry, to make you go through all that. And then as we kind of think through next year, do we take that the 4Q level, annualize it and obviously, you got some more cost saves coming, maybe a little seasonality in 1Q, but can you run rate that for key level and then be lower than that for next year full year,\nDaryl Bible: -- get into $1.6 billion cost saves. So, we'll get that by the end of 2022. We have a lot of things going on in the company right now, besides those five bucket of savings, which we're making tremendous progress in. Kelly talked about the voluntary separation and retirement program that we announced that basically, we have some teammates that volunteer to go away, basically the first wave of that will happen on 9/30, so you'll see the impact of that in the fourth quarter. That will continue to come down over the next couple quarters. The waves probably -- three or four waves overall to get everybody that volunteer to go -- to exit the company. And then Kelly and Bill talked about basically going through all of our processes and adjustments that we're making to have come together and get more efficiencies and scale. When we came together in 2019, we knew what we knew then, we know a lot more now and we're continuing to make our company much more efficient and improved. And we'll have savings from that all through 2022. But to be honest with you, we're creating fuel that basically will not only fall to the bottom-line, but we're also continuing to make a lot more investments in our businesses, in wealth, insurance, CIG, and other areas and we're also investing in technology and digital with this savings that we're getting.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now hear from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Yes, hi, I wanted to follow-up on the new capital target, Daryl said creates $4 billion or $5 billion of incremental excess capital. I just was wondering Bill, Kelly, how you're thinking about that, between M&A opportunities and share repurchases, any thoughts you could share on that?\nKelly King: So, John, our waterfall of priorities has not changed in all these years. And it's what we would think good stable long-term investors would appreciate. The number one is always organic growth is highest payback for your shareholders. The second is a good stable long-term increasing dividend payout. Third is M&A and we have good opportunities there and that's been very, very encouraging. And fourth is buyback and we will do that aggressively when it's appropriate.\nJohn McDonald: Okay.\nBill Rogers: John, just to emphasize that, and Kelly said it, I mean, -- and you see in our results, I mean our organic opportunities are significant. So what we see with our markets where we see our ability to invest and -- so that's going to be priority one, and it continues to enhance.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, and then just to follow-up on that, is it a target, we should think about kind of for the next year or so? Is that how you're thinking about, like kind of maybe moving down over the next year to that 9.75%?\nBill Rogers: Yes, I think John, what we've said consistently is as the risk of the merger comes down and our confidence in the economy goes up, we'll evaluate that target. So, I think we're going to be on that trajectory. And I mean, it would be logical that our confidence is going to improve on the merger and improves every day. Daryl outlined a pretty good chart of the things that we've been doing. And then we'll all look and see how the economy is doing. So, we don't we don't want ever timebound that decision. It's really timebound by what's happening in our company and what's happening in the general economy.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, fair enough. Thanks.\nAnkur Vyas: And I think we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: Certainly, our next question will come --. Thank you. Our final question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Morning. Just on that -- on the M&A front, I know, just indicated that there are -- you see some good opportunities there. Could you just give us your updated thoughts on that front? What type of M&A are you most interested in? And then separately, I'm curious to get your thoughts on President Biden's Executive Order, which seems to be implying greater scrutiny around larger bank deals. Want to see if that makes you think any differently about future deals? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yes, John, on the M&A side, I think we'll be consistent with the things that we've seen. I mean, obviously, in the insurance side, we've had really good experience there and I would expect that to continue. We talked in Betsy's question about some of the enterprise payments, some of the opportunities we have there, some of the point of sale, I mean things that have been important to us strategically digital, perhaps, but things have been important to us strategically, we'll be consistent. I mean it would be -- we won't go sort of off-track from our from our core consistency. And as it relates to President Biden's thing, the -- as it relates to our business, I mean, let's -- maybe take a large bank M&A off the table, we've already done one of those. So, we feel we feel really good about that. But as it relates to our business, I mean, this really plays well with our sort of core middle market business. I mean, if you think about the place where we offer advice and where we see activity in the future, we think we're actually really, really well-positioned.\nJohn Pancari: Great, that's helpful Bill. And then separately just on your systems conversion, could you just give us a status update on where you stand on your core deposit conversion system? Just I want to confirm, are you definitely moving to a new system and not a legacy system when it comes to the core deposit banking system? And then where are you on that progress in that actual -- that part of the tech migration? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yes, Daryl outlined in that one chart sort of all the different components that we're doing. As relates to the core conversion, we outline in there on the fall we'll convert the Heritage BB&T clients. In the first quarter, we'll convert the core STI clients. And that's on a much more agile platform that exists today. So, we're going to have a lot more flexibility in the things that we can do and the movements we can make and the assimilation of acquisitions, the ability to leverage APIs and do more things with that platform, and we are absolutely on track and as you can imagine we're monitoring this on a daily, hourly type basis. We're in just about in the dress rehearsal part for the fall. We're well into the UAT and SIT testing and feel good about where we are.\nJohn Pancari: Great. Thanks Bill. And Kelly, I wish you all the best. It's been a great ride and you should be proud.\nKelly King: Thank you, John. Appreciate it very much. Thanks for your support.\nAnkur Vyas: All right, Shannon.\nOperator: And that does conclude our conference for today.\nAnkur Vyas: That concludes our call. Thank you, Shannon. Thanks everybody for joining. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Shannon, you can now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Once again ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you all for your participation.",

            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning everyone. Continuing on Slide 12, net interest income decreased $40 million, largely due to $32 million lower purchase accounting accretion. Net interest margin decreased 13 basis points are purchase counting accretion was four basis points headwind. Core net interest margin decreased nine basis points due to the continued build of excess liquidity, which was approximately $18 billion this quarter as well as the impact of persistent low rate environment. Asset sensitivity increased modestly due to the increase in DDA and the favorable deposit mix changes, partially offset by the increase in the investment portfolio. I would also know almost 60% of our assets sensitivity is from the short end of the curve, given a solid upside when short-term rates begin to rise. Our diverse business mix is a key strength and continues to provide revenue momentum and a low rate environment. Adjusted non-interest income grew 11% sequentially and 13% year over year, driven by record results in multiple feed businesses. Insurance income was a record $690 million driven by strong organic growth and new business, excellent retention rates, and a firm pricing market. Organic revenue grew 15% versus a COVID impacted light quarter. And we continue to forecast very healthy organic growth. Given the various uncertainties that exist in the marketplace, this is clearly a good time to be in a business that helps clients manage risk. Fee income from investment banking, reflected strong results, and syndicated finance and M&A, raw trading income was offset by $60 million swing and the CVA. We have been consistently investing in and building our corporate and investment banking business for over 15 years and this quarter's results are a reflection of that. Record CRE income was driven by strong structured real estate transaction activity. Our strong performance is also a testament to the CRA teams experience and deep client relationships. Other income benefited from valuation gains on our long standing partnerships related to our SBIC funds and also investments we've made through our Truist Ventures unit. When small businesses win, our communities win. So, we are thrilled with the success we have had over many years with our SBIC program. Continuing on Slide 14, interest expense increased $401 million from the prior quarter. Drivers included a $200 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund to support our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. In addition, merger-related restructuring charges an incremental operating expenses increased $171 million, largely due to the voluntary separation and retirement program that Kelly mentioned earlier. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.1% modestly due to higher variable compensation related to the stronger performance of our fee businesses and overall strong corporate performance. Adjusted non-interest expense was also favorable relative to adjusted revenue growth driving sequential positive operating leverage this quarter. Turning to Slide 15, asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio as well as a stronger economy. Non-performing assets decreased two basis points. Net charge offs decreased 13 basis points to 20 basis points, a pro forma post financial crisis low. Lower charge offs reflect improvements in our indirect auto and C&I portfolios as well as an uptick in recoveries. Our ALLL remained strong at 1.79% with excellent coverage ratios. Due to the improved economic outlook, our provision was a negative $434 million and we released $560 million of reserves. Continuing on Slide 16. Capital remained strong. Our CET ratio increased to 10.2%. Our total payout ratio was 78% and included 610 million of share repurchases. We continue to optimize our capital stack by redeeming our Series H preferred stock. Our latest CCAR results reflect our prudent risk management and resiliency under stress. Truist had the second lowest loss rate in our peer group, as well as above average stress PP&R relative to peers. Our preliminary stress capital buffer was reduced to 2.5% from 2.7%. Our strong CCAR results, improving economy, and merger progress provide additional capital flexibility. Our Board will consider proposal to increase the dividend by 7% to $0.48 per share in its July meeting. We also intend to manage to approximately 9.75% CET1 ratio over the near-term, which would reflect approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of potential capital deployment, either through repurchases or acquisitions over the next five quarters. Turning to Slide 18, we are making steady progress in our integration plan, and our risk profile improves with each conversion. During the second quarter, we successfully converted our Wealth Truist platform. We are very proud of our wealth, digital, and technology teammates for their hard working completing this conversion and brokerage platform conversion in February. More impressively, our advisors continue to produce positive net organic asset flows, which combined with strong market conditions, produced excellent results in wealth management fee income. We also performed extensive testing to prepare for the upcoming core bank conversions. After each milestone, we reflect on what we've learned, apply those learnings to the future integration activities. This reduces the risk and helps us ensure we get better with each step of the integration. As we look to the third quarter, much of our focus will be on the final preparations for the conversion of our heritage BB&T clients to the Truist ecosystem later this year. This will be followed by heritage SunTrust conversion in the first quarter of 2022. Continuing on Slide 19, we are committed to achieving 1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress across those five categories. Third party spend is down 10.3% versus a baseline and now exceeds our revised target of 10%. And retail banking remain at 374 cumulative branch closures and are on track to achieve approximately 800 total closures by the first quarter of 2022 including 39 closures we are expecting in July. Non-branch facility space is down 3.8 million square feet and we were closing in on our target of 4.8 million. We appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track to achieve these goals. Average FTEs decreased 11% since the merger announcement would acquire even further given the WSRP program. Technology savings will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in 2022. We're also making critical investments in digital and technology. Since the merger closed, we have doubled our digital agile teams and tripled our total agile teams, which makes us nimbler and improves our speed-to-market enhancing our client experience. Turning to Slide 20. We still expect to incur a total merger cost of approximately $4 billion through 2022. We have incurred cumulative merger costs of $2.7 billion through the second quarter, reflecting considerable integration work on Slide 18. Looking ahead, we expect these cost to decrease significantly after our first quarter core bank conversion and then drop off entirely after 2022. Continuing on Slide 21, our core non-interest expense was $2.952 billion in the second quarter. This calculation removes the effects from asset value changes for our retirement plans, our insurance acquisitions, and higher variable compensation through the fee income and corporate performance. This makes it much more comparable to the baseline expenses at the time the merger closed. Based on the trajectory of our ongoing cost save initiatives. We are on track to achieve our fourth quarter core expense target of $2.94 billion. We are fully committed to this target and we are confident in our ability to meet it. Now, I provide guidance for the third quarter. We expect total net interest income to be relatively stable versus linked quarter as one additional day combined with moderate loan growth, excluding PPP, offsets declines in purchase accounting, accretion and PPP revenue. Core net interest margin is expected to be relatively stable, however, reported net interest margin will continue to decline as a result of diminishing purchase accounting accretion. These should remain healthy, given investments we've made in our businesses, robust market conditions, and continued economic recovery. They will not be as strong as second quarter performance. This is partially due to insurance seasonality, but we would expect solid growth compared to third quarter of last year. Adjusted expenses should be relatively flat linked quarter, but will decline fourth quarter as lower personnel costs are realized from the VSRP program. We expect the net charge-off ratio to be 25 basis points to 35 basis points given the continued strengthening of the economy. Also if the strong credit quality performance continues, we would expect further reductions in our loan loss allowance ratio. Overall, we had excellent operating quarter as strong fee income more than offset modest lower spread income and outpaced expenses to drive 2% sequential operating leverage. Now, let me hand it over to Kelly to discuss our value proposition. Yes, thanks for the question, Gerard. What I would tell you is that when we established our CECL day one number, we waited our pessimistic scenario of 40%. If you look at the economy now and the growth that we're seeing and outlook, our waiting is much less than that. So, as the economy plays out throughout this year, there is a chance that we could pierce through and maybe go over or go under our CECL day one number that we started with in January of 2020 from that perspective. I think you have to take a quarter-by-quarter and see how it's performing. But right now, the economy seems to be going on really strong and gaining momentum. I think the operating ratio initially is like 70% for Constellation, if you want to add any expenses, but the transaction. If you look at it versus prior year, we'll probably be up anywhere from 5% to 10% range in that neighborhood. We did have some other income in there from our venture capital portfolios there, but be honest with you, we continue to invest in that. And that continues to be part of run right as we move forward. So, it's going to be lumpy back and forth, but it is going to be continuing to grow over time from that. Yes, Matt. In our deck, we have that waterfall slide where we actually take our adjusted numbers and we back out three things, our non-qualified numbers we back that out. We back out insurance acquisitions and run rate because we're trying to compare back to what we looked like in 2019. And then with a huge growth that we've seen in our CIG area and our wealth area and our insurance area, just organic growth, that's great to have those revenues. But those revenues do have expenses, but those are good expenses. We're adjusting for those as well. So, that's what we're adjusting to, to try to get back to what we look like when we put the merger together in 2019. Yes, it's going to be the number, the 2.94% will be the number on the right at the end of the waterfall. That's a core expense, it's not a run rate number. A run rate number is the adjusted number, which basically backs out your merger and restructuring charges, and your incremental MOE. That will tend to basically come down dramatically after the first quarter of next year when we finish our core bank conversions and go away totally by the end of 2022. The adjusted number is the run rate number on a go-forward basis. All core does is basically try to back out because we're a dynamic company that's constantly changing and growing and doing things, we have to back out our expense bases that basically have benefited over the last two years of coming together. So, we're trying to show you that we're getting the 1.6% off of that original expense base by not penalizing us for the additional fee revenue growth that we received over the last couple years and acquisitions that we've done. -- get into $1.6 billion cost saves. So, we'll get that by the end of 2022. We have a lot of things going on in the company right now, besides those five bucket of savings, which we're making tremendous progress in. Kelly talked about the voluntary separation and retirement program that we announced that basically, we have some teammates that volunteer to go away, basically the first wave of that will happen on 9/30, so you'll see the impact of that in the fourth quarter. That will continue to come down over the next couple quarters. The waves probably -- three or four waves overall to get everybody that volunteer to go -- to exit the company. And then Kelly and Bill talked about basically going through all of our processes and adjustments that we're making to have come together and get more efficiencies and scale. When we came together in 2019, we knew what we knew then, we know a lot more now and we're continuing to make our company much more efficient and improved. And we'll have savings from that all through 2022. But to be honest with you, we're creating fuel that basically will not only fall to the bottom-line, but we're also continuing to make a lot more investments in our businesses, in wealth, insurance, CIG, and other areas and we're also investing in technology and digital with this savings that we're getting."

            "content": "Betsy, this is Clarke. It's primarily seasonality. In second half of the year, we always have some seasonality uptick in some of the consumer portfolio. So, we're assuming we'll have some of that normal trend. And I would just also say this was an outstanding quarter, we did have all-time lows and things like our auto business, we had really low C&I, and higher recovery. So, we had some really strong tailwind this quarter. But all that being said, we still feel like we're going to have very strong loss performance as we move forward, given what we see today."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Kelly King",
            "content": "Thanks Ankur, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We really appreciate your support. So, it's a really strong quarter, which reflects our diverse business mix, our consistent risk management. We did have a negative provision, and importantly, I would point out investments that we have made in insurance, investment banking, wealth and digital capabilities, and excellent progress in our conversion. As you've heard us say before, we believe culture continues to be the primary driver of our success. I will point out today and these times, our purpose really resonates with teammates and others as our purpose of inspiring and building better lives and communities is motivational and satisfying to our teammates being involved in helping make the world a better place. We're now focused, you may be interested in knowing and helping each of our teammates align with our culture on a personal basis because we find that engagement really excels when people are aligned with the personal purpose and the cultural purpose. Our EO team is highly focused on cultural integration and activation and as a primary focus for all of us. If you're following the slides, if you look on Slide 5, just want to point out that for us, purpose is not just a banner, it's the way we live. It's truly trying to inspire and build better lives and communities. We focus a lot of attention, especially now and increasing on DEI. I would point out some of the major investments we're making in our communities. For example, this quarter, we contributed a combined $200 million of Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund to support important work of our organizations across our diverse markets and communities. It's very excited that we were able to invest $22 million in Atlanta's Mercy Care, which is a fantastic federally qualified healthcare for homeless program. We expanded our partnership with Operation HOPE with a $20 million investment to help provide more education, insights, and tools to help more people build better lives. And we invest $2.5 million in a grant to the National Institute for Student Success to improve the financial education and graduation rates for underserved students. This is a fantastic program. But it's not just about philanthropy, it's about the way we live around here every day. So, I'm very proud that we released our inaugural Supplier Diversity Impact Report, which outlined a $1 billion total economic impact through supplier diversity relationships in 2020. We're at 114% prorated on our goal for our three-year $60 billion community benefit plan, which is really helping our communities. And through second quarter 2021, we've originated about $17 billion of PPP loans, which really have supported our business clients and employees and our communities. We're very active and increasing our engagement with regard to ESG. We're very focused on energy and sustainable-related financing. We're in the second quarter continuing from 2020, we've invested $2.4 billion in clean energy and sustainable-related financing. Look forward soon into next few weeks for the Second Truist CSR and ESG report, which I think you will enjoy. So now, if you flip with us to Slide 7, I just want to point out some of the key performance highlights. So, a very strong quarter. We had taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion, which was up a strong 4% sequentially from first quarter. We had $5.6 billion in taxable equivalent revenue, we had the revenue and net income was $2.1 billion, which was at 30% linked. Very proud of our $1.55 diluted EPS which was up 31% sequentially and a strong 89% over last year. Our return on average tangible common equity adjusted was a very strong 24.7%. But even if you take out the reserve release, it's still a really, really strong 20.9%, which is driven by strong performance in insurance, investment banking, wealth, card and payment fees, and our commercial real estate-related income. We had strong performance in terms of revenue. As I said, it did drive a 2% increase in adjusted non-interest expenses due to incentives, but frankly, this is exactly the kind of expense increase we like to have. When you put that together, revenue and expenses, we had a solid adjusted operating leverage of 2% and our adjusted PP&R was $2.5 billion, up 6% compared to last quarter. Our asset quality is great. We performed well in CCAR, which allowed us to be in a position to propose a 7% increase in our dividend, a record $0.48 per quarter. Our merger integration is going very, very well and top performance and improved economic conditions give us confidence to reduce our CET1 target to 9.75% and Daryl will talk more about that. So, our total performance for the quarter, we think was very, very strong and very comprehensive, which we feel very, very good about. If you'll flip with us to Slide 8, I just want to point out a few of the selected items that impacted adjusted income. First, we had merger-related and restructuring charges of $297 million, $228 million after-tax, which was a diluted impact of $0.17. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger, I'll point out again, these are merger-related expenses but don't meet the technical definition of merger-related and restructuring charges, but they're not in our run rate going forward. That's $190 million, $146 million after-tax and $0.11 diluted negative impact. As I mentioned, we did have a $200 million contribution to our Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund, which had an $0.11 impact. I would point out in the merger-related and restructuring charges, included in that is a $111 million after-tax accrual related to our voluntary separation and retirement program, which was a program that we offered in June. We had approximately 2,000 teammates that elected to participate. These were totally voluntary decisions on their part, and I want to really thank and appreciate those teammates for their commitment and support and help us build a foundation of Truist. This program does help us reduce costs and create capacity to invest in needed services for our clients. It's really part of our overall intense focus on reconceptualizing our businesses. To thrive in today's world requires a deep commitment to continuously reevaluating yesterday's activities and expenses associated with that, so that we can afford to invest in new activities for today's demands. With that, let me turn it to Bill to talk about some \u2013of our key trends. Just want to make a couple of comments with regard to our value proposition this quarter focusing on our markets and capital. We are really very, very pleased that 70% of our net new accounts are opened by new households. We think this shows market share gains in migration in our markets and our digital advantage as about half of our new accounts are opened online. All of this, interestingly is happening in the face of large number of branch closures that Daryl described where client retention is a very strong 98% plus, which is really fantastic in any type of merger. As mentioned, our CCAR performance lowered risk in the economy, reduced risk in our conversion process, which Daryl discussed gives us great confidence to propose a meaningful increase in our dividend to a record $0.48 and reduce our target CET1 to 9.75%. Just wanted to emphasize that again to make sure you get that, because that's important. We also are very confident in achieving, as Daryl said, our $1.6 billion net cost saves based on a number of initiatives that are driving the reconceptualization of our business; our expense reductions and our industry-leading profitability. We believe that the combination of that will support our investments in future strategies and leading technology investments. Then finally, if you'll just flip to Slide 23, just wanted to make a couple of points that how the metrics and numbers support that value proposition. As we've said before, we have a really exceptional franchise; we have the highest projected population growth compared to our peers in our marketplaces; we have really good fee income diversity with our investments in insurance, investment banking, and wealth; we are really uniquely positioned from a profitability perspective with our adjusted diluted EPS at $1.55, up 89% adjusted return on average tangible common equity at a strong 24.7% and we have strong capital, as Daryl described as well. So, if you look at the quarter overall, it was a strong quarter based on our strong culture, great markets, awesome team. There are plenty of challenges out there, the pandemic is getting better, the economy is getting better and overall at Truist, we fully believe our best days are ahead. Ankur, we'll turn it back to you. Can I make just one quick comment? I do just want to note that this is also Daryl's 50th conference call. So, congratulations to Daryl, but thank you, Bill, for that. I just wanted to say to our audience that has supported us over all these years, it has been honor and a blessing to have worked with thousands of Truist teammates over all these years to serve our communities and I really, really cherish that opportunity. I'll also just say to all of us that banking is an honorable profession, which serves to help build better lives and communities every single day. I am humbled and proud to have been a part of it. Thank you for your support. We appreciate it and as I've said many times, I truly believe our best days are ahead. Hey, Gerard. Hey, Gerard, I would like to add. Bill and I and others have been on regional visits virtually so far this this year, and we've talked, I guess, build a hundreds of offshore business clients and feedback. And I think it's a really big deal. Universally has been extremely confident and positive. They're all talking about projects that they're working on. It is -- as Bill just dropping in and show up and reshoot, I personally think it will really begin to show up as we head in third and fourth quarter and certainly undergo a strong 2022, but the confidence level is very, very high. Go ahead. Hey. Thank you, Betsy and appreciate it. So, John, our waterfall of priorities has not changed in all these years. And it's what we would think good stable long-term investors would appreciate. The number one is always organic growth is highest payback for your shareholders. The second is a good stable long-term increasing dividend payout. Third is M&A and we have good opportunities there and that's been very, very encouraging. And fourth is buyback and we will do that aggressively when it's appropriate. Thank you, John. Appreciate it very much. Thanks for your support."

            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everybody. As you can see on Slide 9, we continue to experience robust demand for digital banking services as our clients look for more convenient and more effective ways to transact and manage their finances. The pace of digital adoption has been especially wrapped and mobile. Since the second quarter of 2020, our active user base has increased by 9% to over 4.1 million active clients. Yet the digital growth stories, it's a lot more than that, isn't just one dimensional. In addition to growing active users, we're deepening our relationships as we accompany clients along their digital journey. By providing the premier digital experience, we build trust with our clients. They then entrust us to facilitate a broader range of transactions. A great example of this is in mobile payments where Zelle transactions were up 60% compared to a year ago. We're also excited about the rollout of our new digital experience that's beginning now ahead of our physical conversion. After completing a successful internal pilot, we're beginning to migrate the Truist Digital offering to a small number of clients, rollout will happen in a series of waves throughout the back half of the year. We anticipate that up to 0.5 million clients could be on the digital platform by the end of this month, with more to be added in each successive wave. On the right, you can see just one example of how we're using digital and meet clients where they are in the small business space. A single sign on focus for clients with personal and business accounts has a significant benefit, allowing our small business clients to toggle back and forth seamlessly between their business and personal finances. Our clients also be able to customize their dashboard and notifications, so they can focus on what matters to them. In addition, our fraud detection technology will help small business clients with -- from fraudulent transactions or more secure banking experience. The attractiveness of our overall approach is that we've created a common platform for retail wealth and small business, which creates agility and seamless client experiences, but the experiences are tailored and designed for the unique needs of each client segment. Now, let me move to Slide 10. Loan growth remain challenging in the second quarter given strong liquidity levels in the marketplace and amongst our clients. Supply chain disruptions and low levels of rates which are driving high levels of refinance activity. Average loans decrease $6.1 billion compared to the first quarter, driven by $3.3 billion dollar in commercial loans and a $2.2 billion decline in residential mortgages. Average C&I balances decreased $2.4 billion, reflecting a $1.3 billion impact from PPP forgiveness and $1.2 billion from lower dealer floor plan outstandings. Nevertheless, we're encouraged about potential green shoots in C&I. Excluding the impacts of PPP and dealer floorplan, C&I loans grew modestly due to an increase in production and stable utilization late in the quarter. Several of our markets and specialties saw growth, particularly middle market. June production and corporate institutional group was the highest it's been since the merger and June production in the Commercial Community Bank was the highest it's been in 18 months. If you exclude April 2020, which was obviously unusual due to elevated line draws. Our revolver exposure continued to grow by month evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building capacity for investments or expansion. Average consumer loans decreased $2.7 billion as a result of ongoing refinance activity in our residential mortgage and home equity and direct portfolios. Residential mortgages held for investment decreased $2.2 billion as prepayment speeds remained elevated despite some moderation from first quarter levels. We're expanding our correspondent capacity and transferring some correspondent production to hold for investment to support future growth. We also believe prepayment speeds will continue to moderate. Indirect remains a bright spot due growth in our prime marine RV portfolios and Lightstream. Overall, loan growth remained elusive in the second quarter, both for the industry and for Truist. As indicated earlier, we're seeing evidence of things beginning to turn and our execution is improving at Truist with a keen focus on balance sheet diversity and prudent risk management. Long-term long growth as an output and highly correlated economic growth and we firmly believe the economy, particularly in our key markets, is on a very solid footing and on an expansion trajectory. Let me turn to Slide 11. Average deposits increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter, largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus. We experienced strong deposit inflows while maximizing our value proposition to clients outside of rate paid as average total deposit costs decreased one basis point sequentially to four basis points. More importantly, Truist continues to resonate with clients. During the second quarter, we had a record personal checking account production and added more than 51,000 net new accounts which attests to the strength of our franchise. We're also doing an excellent job retaining clients as attrition rates from recently closed branches continue to be significantly more favorable than plant. We believe these favorable client dynamics reflect our robust markets, strong digital commerce, production, and solid execution by our teammates in the retail community bank. And with that Darryl, let me turn it over to you for our financial performance. Might make you feel a little uncomfortable, but so bear with me. So, given this is Kelly's last and 50th earnings call as CEO, I just want to spend a few minutes highlighting his legacy, just incredible positive impact on BB&T, Truist, the banking industry, and our communities during his 49-year career in banking. I could take hours to do this, but I won't given that we only have a few minutes, but I thought this group of analysts and investors would appreciate who followed his career. Kelly joined BB&T in 1972 and I thought it was great irony that earlier this week he spoke to our leadership development program, individuals, and teammates who joined just the same way you did, Kelly. When he speaks about the benefits of a growth mindset, positive thinking, choosing to be happy, and seeing opportunities and change just like he just did, he speaks from his personal experience and his heart. Kelly's humble roots give him a genuine appreciation for all people. They've driven his Seeds of Hope initiative and played a key role in our value of caring which says everyone and every moment matters. He's also the driving force with our happiness value. Positive energy changes lives and he exhibits that daily for our teammates and for our clients. Kelly became CEO in 2009 in the depths of the global financial crisis. BB&T was one of the few banks to remain profitable through every quarter through that crisis. When he began at BB&T, it was a small bank in Eastern North Carolina with about $250 million in assets. When he became CEO, the bank had a $152 billion assets, and today, Truist has $520 billion in assets. Market cap is 4 times during his tenure. Always a forward thinker, Kelly is a purpose driven leader who steered BB&T through tremendous change, not just to survive, but to thrive through the Great Recession, multiple economic downturns, and now, through a global pandemic and our merger of equals. In addition to traversing tumultuous business headwinds, I admire he's never lost sight of his personal purpose, which is to make a positive meaningful difference in the lives of as many people as possible. His empathy, compassion, and leadership had tremendous impact on just to name in fairness a few financial education for more than 1 million high school students through the Truist Financial Foundations; childhood literacy, which is a passion of his through a new reading app called WORD Force, which is just getting started; community service through the Lighthouse Project, positively impacting the lives of more than 20 million people since its inception in 2009. Kelly has always had an interest in and a commitment to leadership development. It's the foundation for the Truist Leadership Institute in Greensboro, many of you've been there. It has been renamed the Kelly S. King Center in his honor. It not only trains executives to become better and more self-aware leaders, but it also offers customized training at no cost for principals and has certified many, many students at no cost through our Emerging Leaders curriculum, which is provided in partnership with over 80 colleges and universities. Kelly is known for saying there's no facet of society that cannot be improved through better leadership. Before our merger, I knew Kelly well. I also listened to these calls Kelly, many of your 50 calls. We joined forces with a concept that we can truly build a purposeful company that stood for something better and outperformed with consistency over the long-term. Kelly, you were the perfect leader to start us on that journey. Your inspirational leadership was a positive catalyst for all of us. So, with a heartfelt thank you for your leadership, your contributions to Truist, to our industry, and personally for our friendship. I look forward to our continued partnership and collaboration with you going forward as you transition to the role of Executive Chair for our Board of Directors. So, now we can turn it over to Q&A. Kelly, thank you. You're still in charge. Yes. Sure, Gerard. As I've mentioned, production in June in CIG and CCB was sort of hitting some high points. So, we started to see a little bit an inflection point. In CIG, a lot of that came from industrials, healthcare, tech, that probably doesn't surprise you, I mean, I think as we think about that, infrastructure that's ahead of us. I think energy is a potential for the future. I'll put that a little bit of the question mark, it's probably the light green of a green chute. And CCB, really good progress in our middle market, a lot in our verticals. Senior care, I think, that's really coming back strong. Our dealer network, so we've -- despite the outstandings, our exposure dealer is going up and then just sort of our government services. Again, I don't think those are surprises. Those are pretty core parts of our economy. Overall, revolver commitments were up. So, as I said earlier, I think the capacity of our clients to invest. The -- when this will come? I think that's sort of the question. I don't think -- I think it's -- I don't think it's an \u2013 if I feel like we're in a good position, whether that manifests itself so much in the second quarter. Remember, we still have some headwinds with PPP. But our tailwinds, I think the dealer part will rebound. I mean, you'll see the supply chain start to normalize whether that happens at the end of this year or first next year, I don't know, but that will rebound. The economy, particularly in our markets utilization, and just as Kelly mentioned, our just core executions just gets better every day. So, I think those are tailwinds. Yes, I think Chris had it exactly right. And remember, Mike, I mean, these cut across a lot of different parts and we like to think about the term of integrated relationship management. So that it cuts across clients and we're meeting clients' needs and working backwards. But just to like, give an example, sort of in a Commercial Community Bank, we doubled the number of transactions that we did in the quarter versus last quarter. And these might be where we were left lead, this might be where we were in M&A transaction. And the pipeline has also doubled where it was before. So, as a percent of the growth -- as a percent of the total, it's a smaller percent; as a percent of the incremental growth, it's a larger percent. And I think that's going to continue to grow the momentum, the cultural alignment, the -- all the parts that we've built as part of One Truist, I just feel -- I feel great about it, and that I think that momentum will continue. And you'll see it in just -- the way I think you'll see it as versus revenue synergies, specifically, what you'll see it as an incremental growth relative to others. John, just to emphasize that, and Kelly said it, I mean, -- and you see in our results, I mean our organic opportunities are significant. So what we see with our markets where we see our ability to invest and -- so that's going to be priority one, and it continues to enhance. Yes, I think John, what we've said consistently is as the risk of the merger comes down and our confidence in the economy goes up, we'll evaluate that target. So, I think we're going to be on that trajectory. And I mean, it would be logical that our confidence is going to improve on the merger and improves every day. Daryl outlined a pretty good chart of the things that we've been doing. And then we'll all look and see how the economy is doing. So, we don't we don't want ever timebound that decision. It's really timebound by what's happening in our company and what's happening in the general economy. Yes, John, on the M&A side, I think we'll be consistent with the things that we've seen. I mean, obviously, in the insurance side, we've had really good experience there and I would expect that to continue. We talked in Betsy's question about some of the enterprise payments, some of the opportunities we have there, some of the point of sale, I mean things that have been important to us strategically digital, perhaps, but things have been important to us strategically, we'll be consistent. I mean it would be -- we won't go sort of off-track from our from our core consistency. And as it relates to President Biden's thing, the -- as it relates to our business, I mean, let's -- maybe take a large bank M&A off the table, we've already done one of those. So, we feel we feel really good about that. But as it relates to our business, I mean, this really plays well with our sort of core middle market business. I mean, if you think about the place where we offer advice and where we see activity in the future, we think we're actually really, really well-positioned. Yes, Daryl outlined in that one chart sort of all the different components that we're doing. As relates to the core conversion, we outline in there on the fall we'll convert the Heritage BB&T clients. In the first quarter, we'll convert the core STI clients. And that's on a much more agile platform that exists today. So, we're going to have a lot more flexibility in the things that we can do and the movements we can make and the assimilation of acquisitions, the ability to leverage APIs and do more things with that platform, and we are absolutely on track and as you can imagine we're monitoring this on a daily, hourly type basis. We're in just about in the dress rehearsal part for the fall. We're well into the UAT and SIT testing and feel good about where we are."

            "name": "Chris Henson",
            "content": "Gerard, this is Chris. I might just add that we had 16 of our 22 regions that were actually positive in C&I growth, less dealer this quarter. Right, I'd be happy to that. Maybe Bill and I will take the ERM question first and then I'll jump back and answer your question, Elyse. From ERM perspective, I will tell you it is going really well, where we have been, for the past 18 months, in the behavior building kind of phase. And when I look at this quarter, I see very strong contributions from the Commercial Community Bank to our strategic side, which is a CIG for capital market services. I see a very strong up 20% in a growth perspective, I see mortgage up in the mid-30s. And CIG, which is back to insurance and to a few other areas, up well over 100% in terms of growth. In fairness, we have some other areas that have some opportunity, but I would -- I like what I see and I think what we're building really is the right foundation for behavioral jumping off point across the company. It is something that Bill and I have been partially monitoring and working with each one of the business lines and we're in kind of still of a build-out process from the term -- from terms of understanding sort of what's possible and we're really trying to push a lot of business leaders to think bigger, because we think the opportunity is a very substantial. Bill, anything you want to add to that? And so coming back, Elyse, to your question, and I just preface this with comments that we took sort of a white sheet of paper to this business back in early 2018, brought in a consultant and really begin to break the business down and look at all the opportunities to put the pieces back together. I think what you're seeing here is a three-year -- end of a three-year period of where we have really taken a lot of steps to build back a business in the most effective way possible in a really good operating environment. So, I would have to say this is fundamentally the best quarter I have seen in this business in my career and I've been working on this business a long time. And we are, by the way, cranking off as we conclude the first three-year period, we're kicking off another three-year period, because we think there's more that we can do and will do to improve this business. But to get to your question, what's really driving organic growth is pricing in the industry I think probably peaked in the fourth or first quarter of fourth quarter, 2020 or first quarter this year, it was sort of in the up 7% range where we're now if you read all the industry information kind of in up, call it 6% kind of range. But we really believe while rates have moderated a little, we believe that it's still going to be very positive throughout the balance of 2021. You might have potential for a little slight moderation, but we still think it's very strong in the up category in the mid 5% to 6% kind of category. And we just entered hurricane season, by the way; in the fall was wildfire season. So, you never know, it could just hold or even increase from there depending on what happens. Our client retention in retail is at 91.8% and that's up a 1% over the last year. And in a hard market environment that favors wholesale more, that is a -- that is very much a positive. Our wholesale business is 86.1%, it's up 2%, also very strong. But we are continuing to see risk shift from the standard market that supports retail to wholesale. Probably the most notable driver of organic growth was just our new business production and that is driven just by core GDP growth. And so we're in the up portion of the V right now from an economic perspective. And so 24.5% business -- new business growth is double, the best I've seen historically, year-to-date, we're up 19%. So, we get organic growth rate -- total growth rate of 18.8%, but when you strip out acquisitions organic of 14.8%. We are including in this quarter $29 million of revenue from prior acquisitions, that does not include Constellation, which we just closed on July 1, but includes if you looked at annual run rates, it's about $130 million or prior acquisitions we did, Truist a number of seven or eight to the back half of last year and the first part of this year. So, that's sort of the organic growth question. But to get to your outlook question, just remember we're going from our seasonally strongest quarter of the year to our seasonally weakest quarter from second to third. So, we expect commissions to be down about 8% going from second to third. And there's still certainly uncertainties, but we just think the environment looking forward is still very favorable. When you think of improving economy with the GDP and improving employment, which really drives our AB business, increasing pricing, as we just said and sort of 6% range. And then we benefit from the shift to the E&S market via our very strong wholesale business because while we operate a diversified model, quite frankly. We think pricing is going to continue to be strong. You're seeing sort of the drivers in the industry this quarter. Umbrella in excess is up 11.6%, D&O is up 11%, commercial property, which we have a disproportionate exposure to is up 9.6%, that's really good for us. So, we expect for the third quarter high single-digit organic growth in our weakest quarter, that would be the highest growth that I've seen historically, period. But we're seeing -- we're expecting high single-digit growth in our weakest quarter, which I think is fantastic for the business. And just remember, we did close Constellation on July 1st and that adds %160 million in revenue and really helps us form one of the largest programs divisions in wholesale units of any wholesale provider going forward. No, it is in our forecast. So, what you're typically saying I mean, last year, you'd have seen second or third, we would drop maybe $75 million this year, you would have seen a $90 million drop, but with the addition of this number, you'd see something like $50 million because you've got $160 million annually. Now, there's expense synergies, so this business actually the margin is accretive for overall margin. So, I think there are expenses, but they're synergies that are coming out. Yes, and generally Betsy -- generally, it's about a 12-month integration. Absolutely, Betsy. Thank you for saying that. That is a -- that has been a focus of ours through our -- we really think of it in terms of point of sale. And when we talk about insurance and wealth and CIG, we probably should add sort of a point of sale focus through our core, Sheffield and you also have Live Stream, now we have a group of partnerships that are a little bit more indirect. Buying patterns have clearly changed by consumers. I no longer come to their bank to purchase their items I bought on the spot, and they want it just that way, and now they want it digitally just that way as well. So, we're working on all the above. And I think we have opportunities within our current business to expand verticals like hearing aids and do more in the way of trailers and that kind of thing. So, there are opportunities there, but I think we're also looking at other opportunities to expand like -- in the home improvement space would be a good place, there's a lot going on there. So, it's an area we're really focused on and something that we're really excited about. And it's an industry that has north of 20% kind of growth rates. So, we're very excited about the opportunity."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Alan Greer of Investor Relations. \nAlan Greer: Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. We have our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly King; President and COO, Bill Rogers; and CFO, Daryl Bible who will highlight a number of strategic priorities and discuss Truist's first quarter 2021 results. Chris Henson, Head of Banking and Insurance; and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer will also participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website. Our presentation today does include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. We also want to note that Ryan Richards, the former Head of Director of Investor Relations has left Truist to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. If you have questions following today's call please contact me or Aaron Reeves in Investor Relations. Our contact information is on the cover of the earnings release. And with that I'll turn it over to Kelly.\nKelly King: Thanks Alan and good morning everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call. We had overall I consider a strong quarter with strong earnings and returns, very good expense control, strong fee income, especially in insurance and investment banking; excellent asset quality which Clarke will talk about, really good progress on merger integration, and excellent internal recognitions including an outstanding CRA rating for our community development efforts. If you're following along on slide four, we always like to focus on the most important which is our culture. As you've heard us say many times we continue to reiterate culture as the primary determinant of our long-term success. Our purpose really connects with our teammates. We've been really excited about this. Our teammates are driven to really help our clients. We really enjoy serving our communities and our shareholders. Even with COVID we've made great progress in activating our culture, created a cultural council which works every day with our EL team causing our culture to really come alive. So, we made excellent progress in terms of culture which is ultimately the driver. On slide five just a couple of points on some things that I think are good with regard to how we are serving our communities. We were very excited to be the first issuer of a social bond of the US regional banks $1.25 billion bond. It was well well-received 120 investors, very favorable pricing. We're very excited about that in terms of our ability to focus on affordable housing and other community needs. We became the lead investor for Greenwood which is very excited and innovative digital banking platform designed for Black and Latino consumers and business owners. We signed the Hispanic Promise a first-of-its-kind national pledge to prepare, hire, promote, retain, and celebrate Hispanics in the workplace. And we received 100% score in Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and we were named the Best Place to Work in 2021. We also continue to make great progress in terms of executing on our $60 billion community benefits agreement and we are already at 114% of our annual target. We were very proud to be recognized once again by Fortune as one of the world's most admired companies. On slide six just a few indicators for you about how well the merger is going. I just want to point out to you that the risk of executing our merger has already been reduced substantially and is going down daily as we do conversions and we're getting a lot of the actual merger work done. A huge amount of work has already been done on the core bank conversion. And you'll see in the bubble chart there that a number of conversion has already been done. For example Truist Securities conversion, wealth brokerage conversion. We did a huge amount of work in terms of grading all of the Truist jobs and that has all been executed. We're already in the process of testing protocols for our core bank conversion. A wealth trust conversion is well along occurring in just a few weeks. So, you see that we're making tremendous progress on it. I just want to emphasize the point that for those who think that the risk is going to remain high and won't subside until we do the final branch conversion that is not a good way to look at it. The risk is being mitigated daily as we do these various conversions and make progress in terms of preparing for the final conversion. We did close 226 branches in the first quarter which is part of our strategy. We have been very, very happy with our teammate reaction to that. They're very, very engaged. Recall that we promised all of our client-facing performing teammates that they would not lose their jobs and so it's going very, very well. And our clients are very supportive because remember most of these branches are very, very close to each other and so it's no inconvenience to our clients. We are very focused on meeting our expense targets, which Daryl will talk about and we believe we will be able to accomplish that. Just a few performance highlights on 7A. I think it was a very, very good quarter. We had strong adjusted net income of $1.6 billion or $1.18 per share adjusted both up 42% versus the first quarter of 2020. We had adjusted ROTCE of 19.36%. Recall that we said our mid-term target was in the low 20s so we are well on the way to achieving that already and we have huge cost savings yet to come. We recorded investment banking and trading income at a record level along with insurance. It was offset some by decreases in residential mortgage income and commercial real estate-related income. Strong expense discipline as our adjusted non-interest expense decreased $57 million sequentially and our merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $167 million. We significantly had lower provision for credit losses of $48 million versus $177 million in the fourth quarter so we had a reserve release of $190 million. Clarke can talk about that a little more if we have questions. NPAs decreased $88 million or 6.3%, which we were very happy about. We completed $506 million of share repurchases so we had a total payout for the quarter of about 83%. We did redeem $950 million of preferred stock during the quarter at an after-tax cost of $26 million or $0.02 per share, which was not excluded in terms of our adjustment to net income. So overall, if you look at slide 8 you'll see how the adjustments worked with the merger-related charges having a diluting impact of $0.08; incremental operating expenses related to the merger that are not in our ongoing recurring charges going forward was $0.10; and an acceleration for cash flow hedge underlying expense of $0.02. So overall it was a very strong quarter across a wide array of performance areas. Importantly, we continue to execute on our T3 concept, which is the concept of seamlessly integrating technology and touch so that we yield a high level of trust creating a very high value proposition, which is providing excellent client focus which is ultimately the most important factor in terms of judging our current and our future performance. Now let me turn it to Bill on some additional detail. Bill?\nBill Rogers: Great. Kelly, thank you and good morning, everyone. As you can see from page 9, our clients continue to adopt digital at a rapid pace. Since last March, the population of active mobile app users has increased 11% to more than four million users. That marks an important milestone along our digital journey as a company. We're absolutely committed to meeting our clients where they are. And increasingly, these interactions are happening in the digital space. Our digital commerce data bear this out, as digital client needs have met -- digital client needs met have improved 44% since the first quarter of 2020 and represent more than one-third of total bank production of core bank products this percentage is even higher when you include LightStream and Mortgage. As we accompany clients along their digital journey we often interact with them across multiple digital products and services. Mobile Check Deposits and Zelle are two examples both of which were up significantly from a year ago and this just creates additional opportunities to deepen those relationships. Importantly, the increase in digital transaction activity allows our teammates to spend less time on manual execution and more time assessing and meeting client needs enabled by our integrated relationship management. We're also excited about the new Truist digital experience that is rolling out to our clients later this year. In order to complete the digital migration ahead of the core bank conversion, we're utilizing an innovative proprietary approach known as a Digital Straddle. The Digital Straddle allows us to migrate clients to the new digital experience in waves, reducing migration risk as Kelly discussed earlier and avoiding a onetime migration early next year. We recently launched a successful internal pilot of our new digital experience and expect to migrate our clients in a series of waves during the third and fourth quarter. Let me now turn to slide 10, talk about loans. First quarter balance sheet dynamics reflected a combination of mild loan demand, ongoing government stimulus and elevated liquidity. Average loans decreased $8.2 billion compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to a $4.5 billion reduction in commercial balances and $3 billion of residential mortgage runoff. The decrease in commercial loan balance was primarily attributable to lower revolver utilization and continued pay-down of PPP loans, which outpaced new loan commitments. Approximately $3.3 billion of PPP loans were repaid during the quarter impacting average commercial balances by $1.8 billion. Revolver utilization remained low as clients continue to hold elevated liquidity and access to capital markets. In addition, the dealer floor plan portfolio continues to experience headwinds related to supply chain disruptions. Average consumer loans decreased $3.6 billion, as ongoing refinance activity impacted residential mortgage, home equity and direct loan balances. These declines though were partially offset by higher indirect auto balances, which benefited from strong production, especially in the prime segment. We made a conscious decision in support of our purpose to lean in on PPP loans and we've been the largest lender in many of our markets. And while revolver utilization is at an all-time lows, our commitments are steady. Also acknowledge that our prime mortgage portfolio is more susceptible to higher prepayments. We recognize these are headwinds but we're also optimistic that given vaccination rates, government stimulus and our own view of productivity and pipelines, all supported economic recovery and corresponding core loan growth. Let me switch to the next page and talk about deposits. Average deposits increased $7.9 billion sequentially and are up more than $28 billion from the first quarter of 2020 reflecting government stimulus and pandemic-related client behavior. Average balances increased across all deposit categories except time deposits. While the largest increases were in interest checking and money market and savings, the deposit mix remains favorable, as non-interest-bearing accounts represent one-third of total deposits. Truist continues to experience strong deposit growth while maximizing our value proposition to clients, outside of rate paid, as we continue to experience net new household growth. During the first quarter, average total deposits costs decreased two basis points to five basis points and average interest-bearing deposit costs declined four basis points to seven basis points. Due to new stimulus, we're up double-digits in total deposits since the quarter end. And with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to discuss the overall financial performance.\nDaryl Bible: Thank you, Bill and good morning, everybody. Continuing on Slide 12. Net interest income decreased $81 million linked quarter, due to fewer days, lower purchase accounting accretion and lower earning asset yields. Reported net interest margin was down seven basis points reflecting a four basis point impact from lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin decreased three basis points, as deposit inflows resulted in higher combined Fed balances and securities. Interest sensitivity decreased slightly as the investment portfolio grew in response to the elevated liquidity. Turning to Slide 13. Non-interest income decreased $88 million, despite record income from insurance and investment banking and trading. Insurance income increased $81 million linked quarter reflecting seasonality, $28 million from recent acquisitions and $19 million due to a timing change related to certain employee benefit accounts. Organic revenue grew 6.4% due to strong new business, stable retention and higher property and casualty rates. Investment banking and trading rose $32 million, benefiting from strength in high yield investment grade and equity originations, as well as a recovery in CVA. Residential mortgage income decreased $93 million, due to lower production margins and volumes. Commercial real estate income decreased $80 million, due to seasonality and strong fourth quarter transaction activity. Other income was down $18 million, as lower partnership income was partially offset by gains from our divestiture. Continuing on Slide 14. Expense discipline remained strong in the first quarter. Non-interest expense was down $223 million linked quarter, reflecting $167 million decrease in merger-related and restructuring charges. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased $57 million, primarily due to lower professional fees and non-service-related pension costs offset by personnel expense. Personnel expense increased $34 million, reflecting higher equity-based compensation higher incentive compensation, and payroll tax resets, partially offset by lower salaries and wages. Turning to slide 15. We are taking full advantage of our unique opportunity to build the best of both franchise. The best of both is harder to execute on a typical acquisition, but we are convinced that the client benefits and internal efficiencies justify the effort and expense. As we said in January, we continue to expect total combined merger costs of approximately $4 billion. This consists of merger-related and restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion and incremental operating expenses related to the merger of approximately $1.8 billion. These costs are not in the future run rate and will come out in 2022 after we complete the core bank conversion and decommission redundant systems. Since the merger was announced, we have incurred $1.3 billion of merger-related and restructuring charges, and $900 million incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Continuing on slide 16. Strong asset quality matrix remained relatively stable, reflecting diversification benefits from the merger and effective problem asset resolution. Non-performing assets were down $88 million or two basis points as a percentage of total loans, largely driven by decreases in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Net charge-offs came in 33 basis points, which was at the lower end of the guidance range. Linked-quarter increase was mostly driven by seasonality in indirect auto. The provision for credit losses was $48 million, including a reserve release of $190 million due to lower loan balances and improved economic outlook. The allowance for credit losses was relatively stable at 2.06% of loans and leases. Our exposure of COVID-sensitive industries was essentially flat at $27 billion. Turning to slide 17. Truist has strong capital and ended the first quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.1%. With respect to capital return, we paid a common dividend of $0.45 per share and had $506 million of share buybacks. We also redeemed $950 million of preferred stock, resulting in an after-tax charge of $26 million, or $0.02 per share that was not excluded from the adjusted results. We have $1.5 billion in repurchase authorization remaining under the share repurchase program the Board approved in December. We intend to maintain approximate 10% CET1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions, stock repurchases, and changes in risk-weighted assets. As a result, we anticipate second quarter repurchases of about $600 million. We continue to have strong liquidity, and are ready to meet the needs of our clients and communities. Continuing on slide 18. This slide shows excellent progress towards the net cost saves of $1.6 billion. Through the first quarter, we reduced sourceable spend 9.3%, and are closing in on our 10% target. In terms of retail banking, we closed 226 branches in the first quarter bringing the cumulative closures to 374. We are on track to close approximately 800 branches by the first quarter of 2022. We reduced our non-branch facilities by approximately 3.5 million square feet, and are making progress towards the overall target of approximately five million square feet. Average FTEs are down 9% since the merger announcement. We expect technology savings of $425 million by the end of 2022 compared to 2019. We continue to look at these expense buckets and are broadening to look at other across the board. We are highly committed to our $1.6 billion cost savings target. Continuing to slide 19. The waterfall on the left shows that, we measure core expenses and cost savings. Beginning with adjusted non-interest expense and then adjusting for the nonqualified plan and the insurance acquisition expenses, we arrived at a core expense of $3.065 billion. If you adjust for seasonality of high payroll taxes, equity compensation and variable commissions, core expenses would approach fourth quarter target of $2.940 [ph] billion. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 19.36% for the first quarter. We maintained our medium-term performance and cost saving targets for 2021 and 2022. Further moderation of the merger and economic risk may enable us to revisit our target CET1 ratio. Now I will provide guidance for the second quarter expressed in linked quarter changes. We expect taxable-equivalent revenue excluding security gains to be relatively flat. We expect reported net interest margin to be down high single-digits driven by a mid single-digit decrease in core margin and three to four basis points of purchase accounting accretion runoff. Net interest income should be relatively flat due to the growth of the balance sheet. Non-interest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization expected to be relatively flat. We anticipate net charge-offs in the range of 30 to 45 basis points and a tax rate between 19% to 20%. As you look out into 2021, our prudent economic conditions may allow for further reserve releases. Overall, we had a strong quarter including excellent expense management and strong asset quality. Now, let me hand it back to Bill for an update on IRM.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Daryl. And I'm going to take us to Page 20. I'm going to take this opportunity to share our progress on Integrated Relationship Management and share two examples of what we call natural fit businesses working together to benefit our clients. When Truist was formed, we said we'd create value by combining our distinctive client-focused banking experiences with greater investment in technology and a stronger mix of financial services offerings. As Kelly noted earlier, we called this approach T3 touch integrated with technology equals trust. We're confident in the strategy because it really builds on Truist's strengths. Those strengths include industry-leading client service and loyalty; an advice-based business model; differentiated offerings including Truist Securities, Truist Insurance Holdings and the Truist Leadership institute; and leading technology like our mobile banking app. Integrated Relationship Management is a framework for putting T3 into practice across Truist, through all of our lines of businesses and most importantly for all of our clients. We start with the client, understand their needs, and engage our business partners through our common technology-based referral and accountability process. As mentioned, we have natural synergies such as the relationship between Commercial Community Bank and Truist Securities. This business is by nature a little lumpy and episodic driven by client needs, but we're very pleased with our momentum. Referrals are up by a factor of three in one year and have more than doubled since the last quarter. We continue to train bankers and are increasing both the number and quality of referrals. As we share client wins, teammates gain confidence and motivation to fully leverage all the tools that we have for the benefit of their like clients. Moving to Slide 21 and discuss the effort of Truist Securities and Truist Insurance Holdings and the relationship with heritage SunTrust clients in particular. Referrals to insurance have increased more than 2.3 times compared to the first quarter of 2020 and more than 50% sequentially. We've aligned systems and trained around similar practice groups, which allows us to double down on industry expertise for our clients. I can really speak from experience if this was a real area of excitement from heritage SunTrust and this is really just in the early stages of growth. So Integrated Relationship Management is working. It's been embraced fully by our teammates. It's in support of our clients and a distinguishable benefit for our shareholders. Keep in mind, this is a long game, but you do see the beginning of this incremental opportunity in the overall insurance and investment banking results even in this quarter. So Kelly, let me turn that back over to you.\nKelly King: Thank you, Bill. I appreciate that. So on Slide 22, I just want to point out and reemphasize our value proposition. We believe it is a very strong value proposition driven by our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities.  We have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets some of the best in the world. We are uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns while investing in the future and you're seeing that happening already. We have very strong capital and liquidity position with very strong resilience in terms of our risk profile enhanced by the merger.  So we have a growing earnings stream with less volatility relative to many of our peers over the long-term. So if you think about the quarter in all and overall and wrapping up, I'd just say again, I think it was a very strong quarter. It's a very interesting and challenging times, but look things are getting better. COVID is getting better. It's too soon to declare this over, but hospitalization rates are down and infection rates are down and vaccines are getting out really, really fast. So we're encouraged by that. The economy is clearly improving.  We've said before and I would reemphasize, we believe as we head into the second half, we will have a snapback economy. This economy was not wounded before we headed into this, we simply shut it down for appropriate reasons. Now we're beginning to see the opportunities that we believe could happen, which is turning it back on as easy than it might have been under other types of economic crisis that we've seen.  So Truist is positioned really, really well. We have a great culture. We have great markets. We have a great team. We have a great purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities and it's creating really engaged teammates.  We have real benefits from the merger that are being realized every single day. You've heard some of those. We have very strong performance in T3 and IRM as Bill described and that's really powerful. The merger integration is on track. We are reducing risk every single day. It's all going really, really well. We believe we have the opportunity to accelerate into what I consider to be a very positive snapback economy. We fully believe our best days are ahead. Alan? \nAlan Greer: Okay. Thank you, Kelly. Katie, at this time if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. \nGerard Cassidy : Good morning, Kelly, Bill. How are you?\nKelly King: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy : Can you kind of share with us, if you look at the credit outlook for your company and the industry, we've seen an incredible reduction in the credit cycle because of the policies pursued by the Federal Reserve and the US government last year. Can you guys give us your thoughts on how you see credit cycles going forward? Are they permanently potentially flattened because of what we saw last year? Or is this just such an aberration that we shouldn't read into what we're seeing with this lowered flatter credit cycle? \nKelly King: I would say and Clarke can add some details on that, Gerard. I don't believe this eliminates ongoing long-term credit cycles. I mean, I think to believe that you would have to believe that we have somehow fixed the economy and fixed the nature of humans making decisions and humans getting greedy and humans indulging in excesses. I do not believe that has gone away nor will it go away.  Once we flush through this massive amounts of stimulus into the economy, we will undoubtedly see some excesses. It will likely lead to some corrections down the road that nobody is projecting now and I don't project it in the next two, three years, but there will be some excesses created out of all this excessive money into the system. So we have had a -- heading into the pandemic, we had about a 10-year kind of steady economy. Most people would say and including myself, we were probably heading into a correction.  Now we've had what will be two, three years of COVID experience. We haven't had a correction because of these excesses. That will flow in two, three years. So we'll end up with about a 15- or 16-year protracted period relatively stable ex-out the blip from COVID. But then we'll go back to fairly normal kind of economic variations in my view. Clarke, what do you think? \nClarke Starnes: I agree. The credit stress was resulting from the shutdown of the economy not underlying credit considerations that you would normally see. So we've been around a long time credit cycles will come and go. [Indiscernible] involved inherent risk is going to have a credit cycle in the future. So that's why you always have to stick to your long-term underwriting principles. And you can't ever forget there will be another credit cycle [side of retailing] [ph].\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nBill Rogers: And maybe just add to that\u2026\nGerard Cassidy: Go ahead, Bill.\nBill Rogers: Gerard, maybe just add to that is, keeping our diversified balance sheet is the key to that. So, we're not going to lose our discipline and [blink] [ph] because of this cycle. And we want to anticipate a highly diversified business and a strong capital base to fulfill our value proposition.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good, and then, as a follow-up your franchise obviously is located in some of the stronger economies in the U.S. particularly economies that are more open than some of the coastal economies in the North. Can you share with us the outlook for, if you look beyond the current quarter and look out into the second half of the year about loan growth and loan demand, I know there's excessive liquidity? You touched on it Kelly. What do you guys see the turning points where you could see an acceleration of loan growth possibly in the third or fourth quarters of this year?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Gerard, I'll take that. I think, first of all, what you noted is exactly right about our franchise. I mean, I think, whatever happens and whenever it happens, I think, we'll be disproportionately positively benefited. So I think we'll sort of be the first in that cycle. And we see that not only in case of markets being more open but just the migration. I mean the migration of companies, and the migration of individuals. I don't think that's quite showing up in the data yet, but that's going to show up, because we absolutely, absolutely feel that. That being said, if we start so to say the second quarter is the starting period for loan growth, I think it's reasonable to think that sort of core loan growth, let's exclude PPP from that, because we're a little over weighted in PPPs. So we've got paydowns related to that. If we look at core loan growth, I think we have reasons to be positive for the latter part of the year, in virtually all of our businesses. So maybe CRE being the loan stand -- example on the opposite side. But core C&I, and then the growth in mortgage and then businesses like LightStream and indirect auto and others that are more positively inclined. I think your general premise is right. And I think we're well positioned. And I think that's the latter half of the year phenomenon.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. The specific question is can you give an update on the annualized cost savings as a percentage of the ultimate target? It was $640 million annualized in the fourth quarter versus the target of $1.6 billion. And along with that, you're still sticking to $29 billion of expenses by the fourth quarter. That's down, despite an increase in volume-based expenses such as for insurance and capital markets. And why is that? And if that's the case why wouldn't you be updating your ultimate merger expense saving target?\nDaryl Bible: Yes, Mike. That's a great question. If you take our -- on the slide that we had in the deck and look at what our core expenses are the $3.065 billion. And if you back out the seasonality that we had in the first quarter, due to the payroll, tax resets and the equity that's about $50 million there, we're probably at $3.015 billion give or take a little bit there. We did have higher incentives. Higher incentives this quarter were really driven by our performance in revenues and just overall great performance throughout the company. So, I kind of carve that out. But from a core perspective I think, we continue to make good progress. We are totally committed to getting to the $2.940 billion that we talked about last quarter. We're on track to get there. If you noticed in our comments, we said, we're looking at these five buckets, but we're also broadening out and looking at other areas as well. And we are going to hit our targets for sure. And if we exceed those targets we will continue to make good investments in the company to continue to compete and win in the industry.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Before I use up my second question, so the $640 million annualized, have you updated that for the first quarter or no?\nDaryl Bible: We say, updated it. It's -- we really just gave targets for the fourth quarter. It's going to be lumpy. But it's hard to project a trajectory down every quarter just because of you have a real business that's dynamic and moving. But we made good progress in fourth quarter to first quarter. And we will get our target by the fourth quarter this year. \nMike Mayo: Okay. And the second question since insurance is such a standout and I had our firm's insurance analyst Elyse Greenspan to ask the follow-up. \nElyse Greenspan: Yes. So I was hoping to get some color within insurance on the organic growth on -- it is up to 6.4% in the quarter. On the last quarter call you guys had pointed to 5% for the first half of the year. So I guess what's coming in better than you had expected? And how do you see the rest of the year progressing from here? \nChris Henson: Sure Elyse. This is Chris Henson. We did have a very exciting organic growth number. The elements of it would be pricing retention and new business. I would say pricing was not of what I'd call a continued surprise. The balance increased around 7%. We think rates are generally going to be anticipated to continue increasing throughout 2021. Retention we did level off in retail. So we're just under 91%. We were having a little drift down. As you know we're in that time of the market where a lot of that risk gets shifted to the wholesale segment. Wholesale is actually up to 84.6%. So retention actually continued to perform just maybe a touch better. And we do continue to see that shift to wholesale. New business would be an area I would point to that might have been in a brighter spot than we would have seen a quarter ago. New business production was up 12.8% which is very solid. And what we saw in the quarter was every month that got better. February was better than January, March was better than February et cetera. And that's kind of what drove the 6.4% of organic. And I would also piggyback on the comment Bill made earlier, IRM is actually -- is real. It's having an impact. And when we say that they're linked pretty heavily to the Commercial Community Bank CIG wealth Retail Community Bank, we're actually spending time talking about that and making sure we have aligned with expectations in place and that's having a marginal impact as well. In terms of outlook, the second quarter we'd expect commissions to be up about 3%. We're moving out of the first quarter which is our second highest quarter of the year into our seasonally strongest which is Q2. And certainly, while there's still uncertainties the COVID impact, it's going to have on the economy etcetera we think the outlook is still very positive in this business because we think we're going to continue to see increased pricing. We haven't seen a lot of failures in business so we think we're going to continue to see stable exposure units. E&S volumes are still strong. So -- and given that we are diversified in both wholesale and retail it really helps us in this type of market. So we think pricing momentum will be -- continue to guide us for all the reasons we talked about: COVID cat losses etcetera. And in this quarter pricing being up in the 7% range it was flat with Q4. We did see an umbrella in excess of 14% DNO over 11.5% for example professional liability of 11%. But another area where we benefit disproportionately is commercial property. Commercial property was up 8.5%. We have a lot of that. That's very helpful to us. And of course there's all the coverage classes. About half of the coverage classes were up. And all account sizes were up in the 6.5% to 8.5% kind of range. So I would say for next quarter our outlook would be mid-single-digit organic growth. Even given the uncertainties there we feel very solid about that as we kind of move through. And we think there's upside in terms of the economy continued to benefit to drive even stronger new business. And I think we continue to mature as Bill pointed out with respect to our IRM process and that gives us a good positive growth as well. We did close one small acquisition in the quarter and we certainly expect to be open to do more of those throughout the balance of the year as well. So on balance we're really good about the prospects for the balance of 2021. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nDaryl Bible: Hey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Just the first question I just wanted to make sure I understood the expense guide for 2Q because I think you mentioned Daryl relatively flat Q-on-Q. And I wanted to understand if that was right and maybe some of the things that you're thinking about that keep it flat instead of maybe coming down a little bit.\nDaryl Bible: Yes, Betsy. In my prepared remarks, we did say that we thought expenses on the adjusted basis backing out the merger and restructuring incremental MOE would come in relatively flat. I think we continue to make good progress in the buckets that we're showing and we are starting to broaden out in other areas. We will have higher revenue and fees in certain areas just because of seasonal strength in the second quarter. But net-net we feel pretty good on how the quarter is going to come in and from an expense perspective. I think we're on a good trajectory and we're going to hit our targets.\nBetsy Graseck: And so from what I'm hearing from the prior conversation too is that the expense improvement acceleration is picking up as you move through the year.\nDaryl Bible: That would be the anticipation.\nBetsy Graseck: And then just separately on the revenue side. I know you haven't baked in the revenue synergies, but I just wanted to get a sense as to whether or not you could speak to what you're seeing so far in terms of picking up new accounts or expanding the product set of the accounts that you're with relative to what maybe your budgets or goals have been so far. I know COVID kind of put a wrench in that, but maybe you could speak to how you're migrating at this stage.\nBill Rogers: Yes. Betsy, it's Bill. I think as I said earlier, you see that in the core results. I mean, sort of the penetration that we're experiencing the referral volume that we're experiencing you probably see it most acutely in the results in investment banking and in insurance. But it's really sort of if you look at sort of the overall revenue line. It's really everywhere, I mean. So we've been careful about pointing out one specific revenue synergy against one specific thing because that's not the goal. The goal is to expand all of our relationships. The goal is to listen to our clients put a integrated system together have it the highly technology supported one platform with really good accountability and strong teammate by them. And that's the value proposition. So I think the real answer is just see it in the overall results. Again, I pointed out too that we're more acutely obvious, but literally in all of our businesses you see the advantages of what we're implementing as part of the Truist value proposition.\nChris Henson: Betsy, I'll tag on to that. Sorry, Betsy, I was just going to tag on just saying in the commercial community bank for example, we saw referral activity up 15% this past quarter, which is a really good number of household growth in all the commercial segments. So I think it's a function of what Bill was saying we're just beginning to see movement sort of across the board.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Yes. That was kind of my question in particular post. As we've been reopening, do you feel like that has been picking up? And then I can hear in your answer it seems like the answer is yes.\nBill Rogers: Yes, absolutely. Yes. That's the other part of your question, yes. That's to the -- I think we're again experiencing that a little disproportionately. We're probably leading the country in terms of reopening and reactivity. And we feel that in virtually all of our businesses.\nChris Henson: We came into the first quarter of last year with a lot of excitement. And then second quarter with COVID, we all just sort of hit a wall. But the excitement sort of perseveres through the balance of the year. We just seen I think to a degree just consistent improvement sort of month-by-month.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. \nDaryl Bible: Hi, Matt.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Can you guys talk a bit about your strategy of deploying liquidity in the securities? Last quarter you purchased a lot of securities a little bit less so this quarter. What's kind of just the philosophy and capacity as we look forward?\nDaryl Bible: Yes. Right now Matt what we are doing is we are investing our excess liquidity that we've gotten in from our deposits. But we're averaging about $20 billion at the Fed which we think is a comfortable cushion to basically handle any volatility we might get there. The investments we're making is a combination of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. treasuries. We are averaging up a little bit on the yields that we have on the portfolio that we have out there today from that perspective. So I think the way we think about it is, we're going to have liquidity for a fair amount of time. And we're going to have cash flows. And kind of dovetailing into what Bill said earlier, the best thing that could happen to us is loan growth starts to pick up second quarter into the second half of the year. And we basically runoff some securities that are in the mid-1% ranges and we reinvest them into loans in the 2% to 4% 5% or 6% range and basically keep the balance sheet about the same size and just improve our revenue and earnings overall. So I think that would be the strategy for us to do that. If, for whatever reason that the Fed starts to shrink their balance sheet and liquidity comes out, you got to remember, we have $8 billion to $10 billion of cash flows coming off this portfolio every quarter that we can absorb anything. So, I think, we're taking good balanced risk. Our target right now is to keep net interest income, even with the runoff of purchase accounting flat for the next several quarters. And, hopefully, that will pick up towards the end of the year, as we get meaningful loan growth. \nMatt O'Connor: Okay. Thanks. And then, I just wanted to follow up on the last question, so you got questions regarding revenue synergies. I understand, kind of, pushing at all the businesses and not trying to necessarily, kind of, track it separately. But as we think longer term and the opportunities become a little more apparent and, I guess, I'm thinking loan growth picks up and there's some loans that legacy BBT offered that SunTrust didn't and vice versa, it would seem like the numbers could start being a little more material. And I think what I see is, over time you might provide more details on the magnitude of the synergies. So far you talked about kind of capital market pricing some of that in the fourth quarter. But bringing it all together over time is that something you'd consider?\nKelly King: Matt, I think, we will definitely do that. We're trying to provide timely information on those marginally important issues. But as Bill and Chris illustrated, we really have a broad-based opportunity, not just loan, deposits, all types of fee income. Now we are really just scratching the surface. The reason we keep emphasizing this IRM concept is because, that is the most powerful concept and we think we have an edge on that, because it focuses on all of the clients' needs all of the time. We build a culture where everybody works together. We built systems to allow for information to be integrated across organizational boundaries. And so, yes, you're right. I think you bet, it can be positive in terms of expected revenue enhances as we go forward, as we begin to penetrate more of our clients' needs.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: My question is, as you think about the prospects for loan growth bouncing back for the rest of the year, could you remind us how many of your clients are either non-investment grade, or don't have a debt rating? I guess the big struggle investors have is the capital markets are wide open, private equity firms continue to be aggressive in private credit and sort of, wondering what that universe is of your clients that potentially would need a bank balance sheet in order to expand.\nBill Rogers: Yes. Erika, this is Bill. The key is to have a really balanced portfolio. So there we have a good number of clients who won't access the capital markets. That's sort of that core strength of that middle market community banking model and they'll use bank loans as their primary avenue for growth. Then you see the other side of that, but I don't think that's the only equation. If rates go up, certainly on the long end, you can see large corporates going back to bank loans. They are the most efficient way of borrowing. We've got a lot of revolvers out. Just a little bit of revolver utilization increase is a pretty significant loan driver for us. So I don't think we necessarily think about it as the non-investment grade, the investment grade in terms of a separation. We think about it in terms of the balanced portfolio and we drive it from the client needs. So, if the client wants capital markets and that's the most efficient way, we have great access and great capability and great products. For those that want to have a bank product, we've got a great portfolio of those tight middle-market clients and are able to serve them. So, I think our optimism is really predicated on just this concept of a balanced portfolio versus one versus the other. Does that make sense?\nErika Najarian: Yes, it does. And I think Bill that's a great point on loan rates rising and revolvers becoming more attractive. I think that has -- that point hasn't been made as vocally, so thank you for that. And the follow-up question is, clearly, consumers and corporates are awash with cash. Do you expect that those cash balances have to be drawn before corporates, especially re-lever? Or do you -- are your clients telling you that they're going to keep a little bit more cash on hand, given what they went through during the pandemic?\nBill Rogers: Erika, I think everybody is trying to figure out the answer to that question. You've got a consumer and business. I'll comment on business and Chris can comment on the consumer. I think, what you're going to see is that, businesses are going to end up maintaining more liquidity than you would expect, as they begin to weigh in on new credit facilities, whether it's capital markets or whether it's bank balance sheets. And the reason is because I think you're going to see leaders of businesses that -- were very unnerved with the Great Recession. And then just a few years later got very unnerved with the COVID experience. The end result of that is going to be psychologically a very reserved view. And that argues for maintaining liquidity even as you're borrowing. So, I personally expect that you're going to see borrowing increase faster than most people expect, as we head into the latter part of this year and still maintain liquidity.\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nChris Henson: Consumer what we're seeing -- Erika, for consumer, what we're seeing right now is checking balances are about 30% higher and savings balances are up 140%. Obviously, a lot of that's driven by stimulus. But for lending to occur, there's got to be demand. And I think, we are seeing spending now on nondiscretionary type things which -- I mean at discretionary type of thing excuse me. And I think when cash depletes, there will be more lending, but it is tough today for home equity type products as a result of all these payments.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. \nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to follow up on the fee income side, I think embedded within your kind of flat revenues and flattish NII, kind of flattish fees. And Chris had talked about the plus 3-ish percent outlook for insurance. So, just wanted to understand, given that there was a gain in there too this quarter, just what are some of the other moving parts of fees as you look out? Well Daryl, you had sounded very optimistic at the beginning of the year about the outlook for fees. And just wondering what you think continues to be the other positives and then some things that might be settling back out off of recent strengths? Thank you.\nDaryl Bible: Yes, Ken. From a fee perspective, I think insurance, as Chris said, will have its largest quarter of the year in the second quarter, so that will be strong. Second quarter activity is usually strong in the payments area in activity. So I think all of those will be relatively strong. I think, we're calling for tighter margins in our mortgage area. So that I think even though we'll have higher volumes, we might have lower revenues there potentially. And then if you look into the investment banking and trading areas, we did have a CVA adjustment this past quarter. For that to continue, we have to have rates continue going up. We don't really have a good prediction, if rates are going to go up or not next quarter or not. So we're just kind of saying that's relatively flat. They do have strong pipeline flow in the M&A area and other pieces. So net-net, I think they'll still be strong, but CVA was a benefit for us this past quarter. But I think overall Ken, we feel pretty good about fees. And right now, we're saying relatively flat and we'll just see how the quarter unveils and hopefully we can beat that performance.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Great. And secondly, you've teased out before this potential to relook at that 10% CET1. And obviously, getting through the rest of the pandemic would probably be priority one. But what are the other factors that you need to continue to evaluate that? And could it be a big delta? Or are you talking about just modest changes as you continue to tighten up on what this company looks like over the long term? Thanks.\nKelly King: Yes. So Ken you've heard us say that the relationship between capital and risk is what drives our capital decisions. Going into the merger and up to the current moment, we've judged that the risk externally were substantial. We adjusted the risk of making sure we do the merger right or material. And so as we look forward what we see is that the risk externally are mitigating, COVID is mitigating, economic risk are mitigating. So certainly it's not some huge substantial event that we don't anticipate. The external factors are mitigating meaningfully internally. As I described earlier the risks are reducing daily. And so it does set forward the opportunity for us to have some capital actions that can be attractive to our shareholders. It's hard to judge right now the materiality of that because you literally have to take it a day at a time. One thing we should have all learned is projecting out in this kind of environment six months or nine months now is just not rational, and so you have to kind of take it more carefully. But as we do, as we see risk began to continue to materially mitigate, we do have meaningful opportunity in terms of capital deployment.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Thank you, Kelly.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nKelly King: Morning.\nJohn Pancari: On the margin front, I know you guided to some incremental compression in the second quarter and then in the fourth quarter saw some -- a big greater pressure than expected I think. How should we think about a bottoming of the margin? When do you think that could materialize? Should we expect that for the third quarter? And maybe give us some thoughts around what could drive that. Thank you.\nDaryl Bible: Yes, John. So if you look at margin I'll start off with our core margin. Our core margin was 2.69, we're guiding that to be down mid-single digits. So I think we'll stay in the 2.60s. Given what we know, it's really a function -- this is like as hard as it's ever been in trying to forecast actually a margin number because of all this excess liquidity going on and what's happening with the loan portfolio and all that. That said, we expect to get more deposit growth as the stimulus plays out. That's going to continue to put pressure on core margin. No matter what we do with those funds right now until loan volume picks up, we're either going to put it at the fed or go to invest the dollars. So our margin -- core margin is coming down. We believe that we can probably stay in the 2.60s throughout most of this year hopefully. And if as loans pick up in the second half of the year, we might be in the higher range of 2.60s. But right now I would just say mid to lower 2.60s. And then if you just look at the GAAP, our reported margin we are running off the purchase accounting accretion. It's about three or four basis points a quarter, what it's been doing the last couple of quarters. That will continue. So we're at 3.01. And you adjust for core coming down and then you take three or four down that will come down probably end up in the 2.80s give or take by the end of the year depending on what happens with the accretion runoff. But that said and I think the important thing there is that we are focused on managing NII and we're guiding for at least flat if not better than flat NII as the year plays out.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then separately on the loan growth front you mentioned a couple of times now the likely inflection in loan growth in the -- ideally in the back half of the year it seems like. Maybe if you can help us think about that the pace of growth that could materialize in the back half. And more importantly what type of loan growth is fair to assume as we look into going into 2022? Are we talking about the low single-digit pace as being reasonable?\nBill Rogers: Yes. I think as Kelly noted earlier, I mean it's hard to project out. We had a lot of months here because there are a lot of binary events that are going on. But we just look at things like pipelines. We look at things like productions. We look at things like the impacts of those. So I do think if you look at overall and think about core and think about that base, I mean we're talking about single digit kind of growth through the latter part of the year. The things that could influence that more would be as I've mentioned earlier revolver utilization changes things like that. But I think if you look at, sort of, the core growth part I would think, sort of, averaging single-digits. And then, of course, for us you just have to remember, we have a little bit of that PPP headwind in the total loan growth. But we really think about sort of core second half of the year some type of single-digit opportunity.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Thanks, Bill. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our final question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning. Kelly and Bill, I wanted to follow-up on your ESG commentary in the release. How have your discussions evolved with different stakeholders? Are the investments you're making in ESG a source of differentiation? Or are they stable stakes? And how are you thinking about the financial impact of ESG?\nKelly King: Yes. So, we feel very good about the long-term financial impacts of ESG. It's clearly the right thing to do for our communities for the economy at large. To be honest, it's bumpy right now for all of us to figure out what the near-term economic impacts are, because we're all fairly new at this. But there's no doubt that the long-term economic impacts will be very positive, not to mention the quality of life and the future for our kids and our grandkids. And so, we are really committed to a very aggressive and broad-based ESG program. You're just seeing a lot of things we're doing like our social bond. Daryl has done a lot of things already in terms of bringing our environment. We have lots more plans as we go down the road. So, it's something that we all in the corporate community need to be highly invested in and Truist is. I think it's net accretive long-term. In the short-term, it could be a little bumpy.\nBill Rogers: Yes. I think as Kelly said, I mean we view it collectively as an opportunity versus a requirement. I think that's how we want to think about it. And I think our teammates have embraced that. And I think just -- they are things that will just make us a better company and a better society.\nBill Carcache: That's helpful. Thank you. And if I may as a follow-up, a separate question for Daryl. Could you give some additional thoughts around the variability on either side of around the $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion of merger costs on slide 15? With seven quarters to go through 2022, how do you think about the potential for these to come in either better or worse? Any perspective there would be great.\nDaryl Bible: Bill, I would tell you we're on track of getting about $4 billion. Last year, we did about $1.3 billion. And if you add the two numbers together, this year we'll probably be $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion as well this year as the numbers come through, and then we'll finish out and get the rest in 2022. So, I think we're just on track right now. Our main focus, to be honest with you, is to really do a great job on the conversions to make sure everybody has a really positive client experience. I mean that would be the best outcome of all, and what the cost should -- that we have in there should be able to enable that to happen.\nBill Carcache: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nAlan Greer: Okay. Thank you all for joining our call. This does complete our earnings call. We apologize to those in the queue that we didn't have time to get to your questions. We will reach out to you later today. Thank you and we hope you have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill and good morning, everybody. Continuing on Slide 12. Net interest income decreased $81 million linked quarter, due to fewer days, lower purchase accounting accretion and lower earning asset yields. Reported net interest margin was down seven basis points reflecting a four basis point impact from lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest margin decreased three basis points, as deposit inflows resulted in higher combined Fed balances and securities. Interest sensitivity decreased slightly as the investment portfolio grew in response to the elevated liquidity. Turning to Slide 13. Non-interest income decreased $88 million, despite record income from insurance and investment banking and trading. Insurance income increased $81 million linked quarter reflecting seasonality, $28 million from recent acquisitions and $19 million due to a timing change related to certain employee benefit accounts. Organic revenue grew 6.4% due to strong new business, stable retention and higher property and casualty rates. Investment banking and trading rose $32 million, benefiting from strength in high yield investment grade and equity originations, as well as a recovery in CVA. Residential mortgage income decreased $93 million, due to lower production margins and volumes. Commercial real estate income decreased $80 million, due to seasonality and strong fourth quarter transaction activity. Other income was down $18 million, as lower partnership income was partially offset by gains from our divestiture. Continuing on Slide 14. Expense discipline remained strong in the first quarter. Non-interest expense was down $223 million linked quarter, reflecting $167 million decrease in merger-related and restructuring charges. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased $57 million, primarily due to lower professional fees and non-service-related pension costs offset by personnel expense. Personnel expense increased $34 million, reflecting higher equity-based compensation higher incentive compensation, and payroll tax resets, partially offset by lower salaries and wages. Turning to slide 15. We are taking full advantage of our unique opportunity to build the best of both franchise. The best of both is harder to execute on a typical acquisition, but we are convinced that the client benefits and internal efficiencies justify the effort and expense. As we said in January, we continue to expect total combined merger costs of approximately $4 billion. This consists of merger-related and restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion and incremental operating expenses related to the merger of approximately $1.8 billion. These costs are not in the future run rate and will come out in 2022 after we complete the core bank conversion and decommission redundant systems. Since the merger was announced, we have incurred $1.3 billion of merger-related and restructuring charges, and $900 million incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Continuing on slide 16. Strong asset quality matrix remained relatively stable, reflecting diversification benefits from the merger and effective problem asset resolution. Non-performing assets were down $88 million or two basis points as a percentage of total loans, largely driven by decreases in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Net charge-offs came in 33 basis points, which was at the lower end of the guidance range. Linked-quarter increase was mostly driven by seasonality in indirect auto. The provision for credit losses was $48 million, including a reserve release of $190 million due to lower loan balances and improved economic outlook. The allowance for credit losses was relatively stable at 2.06% of loans and leases. Our exposure of COVID-sensitive industries was essentially flat at $27 billion. Turning to slide 17. Truist has strong capital and ended the first quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.1%. With respect to capital return, we paid a common dividend of $0.45 per share and had $506 million of share buybacks. We also redeemed $950 million of preferred stock, resulting in an after-tax charge of $26 million, or $0.02 per share that was not excluded from the adjusted results. We have $1.5 billion in repurchase authorization remaining under the share repurchase program the Board approved in December. We intend to maintain approximate 10% CET1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions, stock repurchases, and changes in risk-weighted assets. As a result, we anticipate second quarter repurchases of about $600 million. We continue to have strong liquidity, and are ready to meet the needs of our clients and communities. Continuing on slide 18. This slide shows excellent progress towards the net cost saves of $1.6 billion. Through the first quarter, we reduced sourceable spend 9.3%, and are closing in on our 10% target. In terms of retail banking, we closed 226 branches in the first quarter bringing the cumulative closures to 374. We are on track to close approximately 800 branches by the first quarter of 2022. We reduced our non-branch facilities by approximately 3.5 million square feet, and are making progress towards the overall target of approximately five million square feet. Average FTEs are down 9% since the merger announcement. We expect technology savings of $425 million by the end of 2022 compared to 2019. We continue to look at these expense buckets and are broadening to look at other across the board. We are highly committed to our $1.6 billion cost savings target. Continuing to slide 19. The waterfall on the left shows that, we measure core expenses and cost savings. Beginning with adjusted non-interest expense and then adjusting for the nonqualified plan and the insurance acquisition expenses, we arrived at a core expense of $3.065 billion. If you adjust for seasonality of high payroll taxes, equity compensation and variable commissions, core expenses would approach fourth quarter target of $2.940 [ph] billion. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 19.36% for the first quarter. We maintained our medium-term performance and cost saving targets for 2021 and 2022. Further moderation of the merger and economic risk may enable us to revisit our target CET1 ratio. Now I will provide guidance for the second quarter expressed in linked quarter changes. We expect taxable-equivalent revenue excluding security gains to be relatively flat. We expect reported net interest margin to be down high single-digits driven by a mid single-digit decrease in core margin and three to four basis points of purchase accounting accretion runoff. Net interest income should be relatively flat due to the growth of the balance sheet. Non-interest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization expected to be relatively flat. We anticipate net charge-offs in the range of 30 to 45 basis points and a tax rate between 19% to 20%. As you look out into 2021, our prudent economic conditions may allow for further reserve releases. Overall, we had a strong quarter including excellent expense management and strong asset quality. Now, let me hand it back to Bill for an update on IRM. Yes, Mike. That's a great question. If you take our -- on the slide that we had in the deck and look at what our core expenses are the $3.065 billion. And if you back out the seasonality that we had in the first quarter, due to the payroll, tax resets and the equity that's about $50 million there, we're probably at $3.015 billion give or take a little bit there. We did have higher incentives. Higher incentives this quarter were really driven by our performance in revenues and just overall great performance throughout the company. So, I kind of carve that out. But from a core perspective I think, we continue to make good progress. We are totally committed to getting to the $2.940 billion that we talked about last quarter. We're on track to get there. If you noticed in our comments, we said, we're looking at these five buckets, but we're also broadening out and looking at other areas as well. And we are going to hit our targets for sure. And if we exceed those targets we will continue to make good investments in the company to continue to compete and win in the industry. We say, updated it. It's -- we really just gave targets for the fourth quarter. It's going to be lumpy. But it's hard to project a trajectory down every quarter just because of you have a real business that's dynamic and moving. But we made good progress in fourth quarter to first quarter. And we will get our target by the fourth quarter this year. Hey, Betsy. Yes, Betsy. In my prepared remarks, we did say that we thought expenses on the adjusted basis backing out the merger and restructuring incremental MOE would come in relatively flat. I think we continue to make good progress in the buckets that we're showing and we are starting to broaden out in other areas. We will have higher revenue and fees in certain areas just because of seasonal strength in the second quarter. But net-net we feel pretty good on how the quarter is going to come in and from an expense perspective. I think we're on a good trajectory and we're going to hit our targets. That would be the anticipation. Hi, Matt. Yes. Right now Matt what we are doing is we are investing our excess liquidity that we've gotten in from our deposits. But we're averaging about $20 billion at the Fed which we think is a comfortable cushion to basically handle any volatility we might get there. The investments we're making is a combination of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. treasuries. We are averaging up a little bit on the yields that we have on the portfolio that we have out there today from that perspective. So I think the way we think about it is, we're going to have liquidity for a fair amount of time. And we're going to have cash flows. And kind of dovetailing into what Bill said earlier, the best thing that could happen to us is loan growth starts to pick up second quarter into the second half of the year. And we basically runoff some securities that are in the mid-1% ranges and we reinvest them into loans in the 2% to 4% 5% or 6% range and basically keep the balance sheet about the same size and just improve our revenue and earnings overall. So I think that would be the strategy for us to do that. If, for whatever reason that the Fed starts to shrink their balance sheet and liquidity comes out, you got to remember, we have $8 billion to $10 billion of cash flows coming off this portfolio every quarter that we can absorb anything. So, I think, we're taking good balanced risk. Our target right now is to keep net interest income, even with the runoff of purchase accounting flat for the next several quarters. And, hopefully, that will pick up towards the end of the year, as we get meaningful loan growth. Yes, Ken. From a fee perspective, I think insurance, as Chris said, will have its largest quarter of the year in the second quarter, so that will be strong. Second quarter activity is usually strong in the payments area in activity. So I think all of those will be relatively strong. I think, we're calling for tighter margins in our mortgage area. So that I think even though we'll have higher volumes, we might have lower revenues there potentially. And then if you look into the investment banking and trading areas, we did have a CVA adjustment this past quarter. For that to continue, we have to have rates continue going up. We don't really have a good prediction, if rates are going to go up or not next quarter or not. So we're just kind of saying that's relatively flat. They do have strong pipeline flow in the M&A area and other pieces. So net-net, I think they'll still be strong, but CVA was a benefit for us this past quarter. But I think overall Ken, we feel pretty good about fees. And right now, we're saying relatively flat and we'll just see how the quarter unveils and hopefully we can beat that performance. Yes, John. So if you look at margin I'll start off with our core margin. Our core margin was 2.69, we're guiding that to be down mid-single digits. So I think we'll stay in the 2.60s. Given what we know, it's really a function -- this is like as hard as it's ever been in trying to forecast actually a margin number because of all this excess liquidity going on and what's happening with the loan portfolio and all that. That said, we expect to get more deposit growth as the stimulus plays out. That's going to continue to put pressure on core margin. No matter what we do with those funds right now until loan volume picks up, we're either going to put it at the fed or go to invest the dollars. So our margin -- core margin is coming down. We believe that we can probably stay in the 2.60s throughout most of this year hopefully. And if as loans pick up in the second half of the year, we might be in the higher range of 2.60s. But right now I would just say mid to lower 2.60s. And then if you just look at the GAAP, our reported margin we are running off the purchase accounting accretion. It's about three or four basis points a quarter, what it's been doing the last couple of quarters. That will continue. So we're at 3.01. And you adjust for core coming down and then you take three or four down that will come down probably end up in the 2.80s give or take by the end of the year depending on what happens with the accretion runoff. But that said and I think the important thing there is that we are focused on managing NII and we're guiding for at least flat if not better than flat NII as the year plays out. Bill, I would tell you we're on track of getting about $4 billion. Last year, we did about $1.3 billion. And if you add the two numbers together, this year we'll probably be $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion as well this year as the numbers come through, and then we'll finish out and get the rest in 2022. So, I think we're just on track right now. Our main focus, to be honest with you, is to really do a great job on the conversions to make sure everybody has a really positive client experience. I mean that would be the best outcome of all, and what the cost should -- that we have in there should be able to enable that to happen."

So we've been around a long time credit cycles will come and go. [Indiscernible] involved inherent risk is going to have a credit cycle in the future. So that's why you always have to stick to your long-term underwriting principles. And you can't ever forget there will be another credit cycle [side of retailing] [ph]."

            "name": "Kelly King",
            "content": "Thanks Alan and good morning everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call. We had overall I consider a strong quarter with strong earnings and returns, very good expense control, strong fee income, especially in insurance and investment banking; excellent asset quality which Clarke will talk about, really good progress on merger integration, and excellent internal recognitions including an outstanding CRA rating for our community development efforts. If you're following along on slide four, we always like to focus on the most important which is our culture. As you've heard us say many times we continue to reiterate culture as the primary determinant of our long-term success. Our purpose really connects with our teammates. We've been really excited about this. Our teammates are driven to really help our clients. We really enjoy serving our communities and our shareholders. Even with COVID we've made great progress in activating our culture, created a cultural council which works every day with our EL team causing our culture to really come alive. So, we made excellent progress in terms of culture which is ultimately the driver. On slide five just a couple of points on some things that I think are good with regard to how we are serving our communities. We were very excited to be the first issuer of a social bond of the US regional banks $1.25 billion bond. It was well well-received 120 investors, very favorable pricing. We're very excited about that in terms of our ability to focus on affordable housing and other community needs. We became the lead investor for Greenwood which is very excited and innovative digital banking platform designed for Black and Latino consumers and business owners. We signed the Hispanic Promise a first-of-its-kind national pledge to prepare, hire, promote, retain, and celebrate Hispanics in the workplace. And we received 100% score in Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and we were named the Best Place to Work in 2021. We also continue to make great progress in terms of executing on our $60 billion community benefits agreement and we are already at 114% of our annual target. We were very proud to be recognized once again by Fortune as one of the world's most admired companies. On slide six just a few indicators for you about how well the merger is going. I just want to point out to you that the risk of executing our merger has already been reduced substantially and is going down daily as we do conversions and we're getting a lot of the actual merger work done. A huge amount of work has already been done on the core bank conversion. And you'll see in the bubble chart there that a number of conversion has already been done. For example Truist Securities conversion, wealth brokerage conversion. We did a huge amount of work in terms of grading all of the Truist jobs and that has all been executed. We're already in the process of testing protocols for our core bank conversion. A wealth trust conversion is well along occurring in just a few weeks. So, you see that we're making tremendous progress on it. I just want to emphasize the point that for those who think that the risk is going to remain high and won't subside until we do the final branch conversion that is not a good way to look at it. The risk is being mitigated daily as we do these various conversions and make progress in terms of preparing for the final conversion. We did close 226 branches in the first quarter which is part of our strategy. We have been very, very happy with our teammate reaction to that. They're very, very engaged. Recall that we promised all of our client-facing performing teammates that they would not lose their jobs and so it's going very, very well. And our clients are very supportive because remember most of these branches are very, very close to each other and so it's no inconvenience to our clients. We are very focused on meeting our expense targets, which Daryl will talk about and we believe we will be able to accomplish that. Just a few performance highlights on 7A. I think it was a very, very good quarter. We had strong adjusted net income of $1.6 billion or $1.18 per share adjusted both up 42% versus the first quarter of 2020. We had adjusted ROTCE of 19.36%. Recall that we said our mid-term target was in the low 20s so we are well on the way to achieving that already and we have huge cost savings yet to come. We recorded investment banking and trading income at a record level along with insurance. It was offset some by decreases in residential mortgage income and commercial real estate-related income. Strong expense discipline as our adjusted non-interest expense decreased $57 million sequentially and our merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $167 million. We significantly had lower provision for credit losses of $48 million versus $177 million in the fourth quarter so we had a reserve release of $190 million. Clarke can talk about that a little more if we have questions. NPAs decreased $88 million or 6.3%, which we were very happy about. We completed $506 million of share repurchases so we had a total payout for the quarter of about 83%. We did redeem $950 million of preferred stock during the quarter at an after-tax cost of $26 million or $0.02 per share, which was not excluded in terms of our adjustment to net income. So overall, if you look at slide 8 you'll see how the adjustments worked with the merger-related charges having a diluting impact of $0.08; incremental operating expenses related to the merger that are not in our ongoing recurring charges going forward was $0.10; and an acceleration for cash flow hedge underlying expense of $0.02. So overall it was a very strong quarter across a wide array of performance areas. Importantly, we continue to execute on our T3 concept, which is the concept of seamlessly integrating technology and touch so that we yield a high level of trust creating a very high value proposition, which is providing excellent client focus which is ultimately the most important factor in terms of judging our current and our future performance. Now let me turn it to Bill on some additional detail. Bill? Thank you, Bill. I appreciate that. So on Slide 22, I just want to point out and reemphasize our value proposition. We believe it is a very strong value proposition driven by our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities.  We have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets some of the best in the world. We are uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns while investing in the future and you're seeing that happening already. We have very strong capital and liquidity position with very strong resilience in terms of our risk profile enhanced by the merger.  So we have a growing earnings stream with less volatility relative to many of our peers over the long-term. So if you think about the quarter in all and overall and wrapping up, I'd just say again, I think it was a very strong quarter. It's a very interesting and challenging times, but look things are getting better. COVID is getting better. It's too soon to declare this over, but hospitalization rates are down and infection rates are down and vaccines are getting out really, really fast. So we're encouraged by that. The economy is clearly improving.  We've said before and I would reemphasize, we believe as we head into the second half, we will have a snapback economy. This economy was not wounded before we headed into this, we simply shut it down for appropriate reasons. Now we're beginning to see the opportunities that we believe could happen, which is turning it back on as easy than it might have been under other types of economic crisis that we've seen.  So Truist is positioned really, really well. We have a great culture. We have great markets. We have a great team. We have a great purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities and it's creating really engaged teammates.  We have real benefits from the merger that are being realized every single day. You've heard some of those. We have very strong performance in T3 and IRM as Bill described and that's really powerful. The merger integration is on track. We are reducing risk every single day. It's all going really, really well. We believe we have the opportunity to accelerate into what I consider to be a very positive snapback economy. We fully believe our best days are ahead. Alan? Hi, Gerard. I would say and Clarke can add some details on that, Gerard. I don't believe this eliminates ongoing long-term credit cycles. I mean, I think to believe that you would have to believe that we have somehow fixed the economy and fixed the nature of humans making decisions and humans getting greedy and humans indulging in excesses. I do not believe that has gone away nor will it go away.  Once we flush through this massive amounts of stimulus into the economy, we will undoubtedly see some excesses. It will likely lead to some corrections down the road that nobody is projecting now and I don't project it in the next two, three years, but there will be some excesses created out of all this excessive money into the system. So we have had a -- heading into the pandemic, we had about a 10-year kind of steady economy. Most people would say and including myself, we were probably heading into a correction.  Now we've had what will be two, three years of COVID experience. We haven't had a correction because of these excesses. That will flow in two, three years. So we'll end up with about a 15- or 16-year protracted period relatively stable ex-out the blip from COVID. But then we'll go back to fairly normal kind of economic variations in my view. Clarke, what do you think? Matt, I think, we will definitely do that. We're trying to provide timely information on those marginally important issues. But as Bill and Chris illustrated, we really have a broad-based opportunity, not just loan, deposits, all types of fee income. Now we are really just scratching the surface. The reason we keep emphasizing this IRM concept is because, that is the most powerful concept and we think we have an edge on that, because it focuses on all of the clients' needs all of the time. We build a culture where everybody works together. We built systems to allow for information to be integrated across organizational boundaries. And so, yes, you're right. I think you bet, it can be positive in terms of expected revenue enhances as we go forward, as we begin to penetrate more of our clients' needs. Yes. So Ken you've heard us say that the relationship between capital and risk is what drives our capital decisions. Going into the merger and up to the current moment, we've judged that the risk externally were substantial. We adjusted the risk of making sure we do the merger right or material. And so as we look forward what we see is that the risk externally are mitigating, COVID is mitigating, economic risk are mitigating. So certainly it's not some huge substantial event that we don't anticipate. The external factors are mitigating meaningfully internally. As I described earlier the risks are reducing daily. And so it does set forward the opportunity for us to have some capital actions that can be attractive to our shareholders. It's hard to judge right now the materiality of that because you literally have to take it a day at a time. One thing we should have all learned is projecting out in this kind of environment six months or nine months now is just not rational, and so you have to kind of take it more carefully. But as we do, as we see risk began to continue to materially mitigate, we do have meaningful opportunity in terms of capital deployment. Morning. Yes. So, we feel very good about the long-term financial impacts of ESG. It's clearly the right thing to do for our communities for the economy at large. To be honest, it's bumpy right now for all of us to figure out what the near-term economic impacts are, because we're all fairly new at this. But there's no doubt that the long-term economic impacts will be very positive, not to mention the quality of life and the future for our kids and our grandkids. And so, we are really committed to a very aggressive and broad-based ESG program. You're just seeing a lot of things we're doing like our social bond. Daryl has done a lot of things already in terms of bringing our environment. We have lots more plans as we go down the road. So, it's something that we all in the corporate community need to be highly invested in and Truist is. I think it's net accretive long-term. In the short-term, it could be a little bumpy."

            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Great. Kelly, thank you and good morning, everyone. As you can see from page 9, our clients continue to adopt digital at a rapid pace. Since last March, the population of active mobile app users has increased 11% to more than four million users. That marks an important milestone along our digital journey as a company. We're absolutely committed to meeting our clients where they are. And increasingly, these interactions are happening in the digital space. Our digital commerce data bear this out, as digital client needs have met -- digital client needs met have improved 44% since the first quarter of 2020 and represent more than one-third of total bank production of core bank products this percentage is even higher when you include LightStream and Mortgage. As we accompany clients along their digital journey we often interact with them across multiple digital products and services. Mobile Check Deposits and Zelle are two examples both of which were up significantly from a year ago and this just creates additional opportunities to deepen those relationships. Importantly, the increase in digital transaction activity allows our teammates to spend less time on manual execution and more time assessing and meeting client needs enabled by our integrated relationship management. We're also excited about the new Truist digital experience that is rolling out to our clients later this year. In order to complete the digital migration ahead of the core bank conversion, we're utilizing an innovative proprietary approach known as a Digital Straddle. The Digital Straddle allows us to migrate clients to the new digital experience in waves, reducing migration risk as Kelly discussed earlier and avoiding a onetime migration early next year. We recently launched a successful internal pilot of our new digital experience and expect to migrate our clients in a series of waves during the third and fourth quarter. Let me now turn to slide 10, talk about loans. First quarter balance sheet dynamics reflected a combination of mild loan demand, ongoing government stimulus and elevated liquidity. Average loans decreased $8.2 billion compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to a $4.5 billion reduction in commercial balances and $3 billion of residential mortgage runoff. The decrease in commercial loan balance was primarily attributable to lower revolver utilization and continued pay-down of PPP loans, which outpaced new loan commitments. Approximately $3.3 billion of PPP loans were repaid during the quarter impacting average commercial balances by $1.8 billion. Revolver utilization remained low as clients continue to hold elevated liquidity and access to capital markets. In addition, the dealer floor plan portfolio continues to experience headwinds related to supply chain disruptions. Average consumer loans decreased $3.6 billion, as ongoing refinance activity impacted residential mortgage, home equity and direct loan balances. These declines though were partially offset by higher indirect auto balances, which benefited from strong production, especially in the prime segment. We made a conscious decision in support of our purpose to lean in on PPP loans and we've been the largest lender in many of our markets. And while revolver utilization is at an all-time lows, our commitments are steady. Also acknowledge that our prime mortgage portfolio is more susceptible to higher prepayments. We recognize these are headwinds but we're also optimistic that given vaccination rates, government stimulus and our own view of productivity and pipelines, all supported economic recovery and corresponding core loan growth. Let me switch to the next page and talk about deposits. Average deposits increased $7.9 billion sequentially and are up more than $28 billion from the first quarter of 2020 reflecting government stimulus and pandemic-related client behavior. Average balances increased across all deposit categories except time deposits. While the largest increases were in interest checking and money market and savings, the deposit mix remains favorable, as non-interest-bearing accounts represent one-third of total deposits. Truist continues to experience strong deposit growth while maximizing our value proposition to clients, outside of rate paid, as we continue to experience net new household growth. During the first quarter, average total deposits costs decreased two basis points to five basis points and average interest-bearing deposit costs declined four basis points to seven basis points. Due to new stimulus, we're up double-digits in total deposits since the quarter end. And with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to discuss the overall financial performance. Thanks, Daryl. And I'm going to take us to Page 20. I'm going to take this opportunity to share our progress on Integrated Relationship Management and share two examples of what we call natural fit businesses working together to benefit our clients. When Truist was formed, we said we'd create value by combining our distinctive client-focused banking experiences with greater investment in technology and a stronger mix of financial services offerings. As Kelly noted earlier, we called this approach T3 touch integrated with technology equals trust. We're confident in the strategy because it really builds on Truist's strengths. Those strengths include industry-leading client service and loyalty; an advice-based business model; differentiated offerings including Truist Securities, Truist Insurance Holdings and the Truist Leadership institute; and leading technology like our mobile banking app. Integrated Relationship Management is a framework for putting T3 into practice across Truist, through all of our lines of businesses and most importantly for all of our clients. We start with the client, understand their needs, and engage our business partners through our common technology-based referral and accountability process. As mentioned, we have natural synergies such as the relationship between Commercial Community Bank and Truist Securities. This business is by nature a little lumpy and episodic driven by client needs, but we're very pleased with our momentum. Referrals are up by a factor of three in one year and have more than doubled since the last quarter. We continue to train bankers and are increasing both the number and quality of referrals. As we share client wins, teammates gain confidence and motivation to fully leverage all the tools that we have for the benefit of their like clients. Moving to Slide 21 and discuss the effort of Truist Securities and Truist Insurance Holdings and the relationship with heritage SunTrust clients in particular. Referrals to insurance have increased more than 2.3 times compared to the first quarter of 2020 and more than 50% sequentially. We've aligned systems and trained around similar practice groups, which allows us to double down on industry expertise for our clients. I can really speak from experience if this was a real area of excitement from heritage SunTrust and this is really just in the early stages of growth. So Integrated Relationship Management is working. It's been embraced fully by our teammates. It's in support of our clients and a distinguishable benefit for our shareholders. Keep in mind, this is a long game, but you do see the beginning of this incremental opportunity in the overall insurance and investment banking results even in this quarter. So Kelly, let me turn that back over to you. And maybe just add to that... Gerard, maybe just add to that is, keeping our diversified balance sheet is the key to that. So, we're not going to lose our discipline and [blink] [ph] because of this cycle. And we want to anticipate a highly diversified business and a strong capital base to fulfill our value proposition. Yes. Gerard, I'll take that. I think, first of all, what you noted is exactly right about our franchise. I mean, I think, whatever happens and whenever it happens, I think, we'll be disproportionately positively benefited. So I think we'll sort of be the first in that cycle. And we see that not only in case of markets being more open but just the migration. I mean the migration of companies, and the migration of individuals. I don't think that's quite showing up in the data yet, but that's going to show up, because we absolutely, absolutely feel that. That being said, if we start so to say the second quarter is the starting period for loan growth, I think it's reasonable to think that sort of core loan growth, let's exclude PPP from that, because we're a little over weighted in PPPs. So we've got paydowns related to that. If we look at core loan growth, I think we have reasons to be positive for the latter part of the year, in virtually all of our businesses. So maybe CRE being the loan stand -- example on the opposite side. But core C&I, and then the growth in mortgage and then businesses like LightStream and indirect auto and others that are more positively inclined. I think your general premise is right. And I think we're well positioned. And I think that's the latter half of the year phenomenon. Yes. Betsy, it's Bill. I think as I said earlier, you see that in the core results. I mean, sort of the penetration that we're experiencing the referral volume that we're experiencing you probably see it most acutely in the results in investment banking and in insurance. But it's really sort of if you look at sort of the overall revenue line. It's really everywhere, I mean. So we've been careful about pointing out one specific revenue synergy against one specific thing because that's not the goal. The goal is to expand all of our relationships. The goal is to listen to our clients put a integrated system together have it the highly technology supported one platform with really good accountability and strong teammate by them. And that's the value proposition. So I think the real answer is just see it in the overall results. Again, I pointed out too that we're more acutely obvious, but literally in all of our businesses you see the advantages of what we're implementing as part of the Truist value proposition. Yes, absolutely. Yes. That's the other part of your question, yes. That's to the -- I think we're again experiencing that a little disproportionately. We're probably leading the country in terms of reopening and reactivity. And we feel that in virtually all of our businesses. Good morning. Yes. Erika, this is Bill. The key is to have a really balanced portfolio. So there we have a good number of clients who won't access the capital markets. That's sort of that core strength of that middle market community banking model and they'll use bank loans as their primary avenue for growth. Then you see the other side of that, but I don't think that's the only equation. If rates go up, certainly on the long end, you can see large corporates going back to bank loans. They are the most efficient way of borrowing. We've got a lot of revolvers out. Just a little bit of revolver utilization increase is a pretty significant loan driver for us. So I don't think we necessarily think about it as the non-investment grade, the investment grade in terms of a separation. We think about it in terms of the balanced portfolio and we drive it from the client needs. So, if the client wants capital markets and that's the most efficient way, we have great access and great capability and great products. For those that want to have a bank product, we've got a great portfolio of those tight middle-market clients and are able to serve them. So, I think our optimism is really predicated on just this concept of a balanced portfolio versus one versus the other. Does that make sense? Erika, I think everybody is trying to figure out the answer to that question. You've got a consumer and business. I'll comment on business and Chris can comment on the consumer. I think, what you're going to see is that, businesses are going to end up maintaining more liquidity than you would expect, as they begin to weigh in on new credit facilities, whether it's capital markets or whether it's bank balance sheets. And the reason is because I think you're going to see leaders of businesses that -- were very unnerved with the Great Recession. And then just a few years later got very unnerved with the COVID experience. The end result of that is going to be psychologically a very reserved view. And that argues for maintaining liquidity even as you're borrowing. So, I personally expect that you're going to see borrowing increase faster than most people expect, as we head into the latter part of this year and still maintain liquidity. Yes. I think as Kelly noted earlier, I mean it's hard to project out. We had a lot of months here because there are a lot of binary events that are going on. But we just look at things like pipelines. We look at things like productions. We look at things like the impacts of those. So I do think if you look at overall and think about core and think about that base, I mean we're talking about single digit kind of growth through the latter part of the year. The things that could influence that more would be as I've mentioned earlier revolver utilization changes things like that. But I think if you look at, sort of, the core growth part I would think, sort of, averaging single-digits. And then, of course, for us you just have to remember, we have a little bit of that PPP headwind in the total loan growth. But we really think about sort of core second half of the year some type of single-digit opportunity. Yes. I think as Kelly said, I mean we view it collectively as an opportunity versus a requirement. I think that's how we want to think about it. And I think our teammates have embraced that. And I think just -- they are things that will just make us a better company and a better society."

            "name": "Chris Henson",
            "content": "Sure Elyse. This is Chris Henson. We did have a very exciting organic growth number. The elements of it would be pricing retention and new business. I would say pricing was not of what I'd call a continued surprise. The balance increased around 7%. We think rates are generally going to be anticipated to continue increasing throughout 2021. Retention we did level off in retail. So we're just under 91%. We were having a little drift down. As you know we're in that time of the market where a lot of that risk gets shifted to the wholesale segment. Wholesale is actually up to 84.6%. So retention actually continued to perform just maybe a touch better. And we do continue to see that shift to wholesale. New business would be an area I would point to that might have been in a brighter spot than we would have seen a quarter ago. New business production was up 12.8% which is very solid. And what we saw in the quarter was every month that got better. February was better than January, March was better than February et cetera. And that's kind of what drove the 6.4% of organic. And I would also piggyback on the comment Bill made earlier, IRM is actually -- is real. It's having an impact. And when we say that they're linked pretty heavily to the Commercial Community Bank CIG wealth Retail Community Bank, we're actually spending time talking about that and making sure we have aligned with expectations in place and that's having a marginal impact as well. In terms of outlook, the second quarter we'd expect commissions to be up about 3%. We're moving out of the first quarter which is our second highest quarter of the year into our seasonally strongest which is Q2. And certainly, while there's still uncertainties the COVID impact, it's going to have on the economy etcetera we think the outlook is still very positive in this business because we think we're going to continue to see increased pricing. We haven't seen a lot of failures in business so we think we're going to continue to see stable exposure units. E&S volumes are still strong. So -- and given that we are diversified in both wholesale and retail it really helps us in this type of market. So we think pricing momentum will be -- continue to guide us for all the reasons we talked about: COVID cat losses etcetera. And in this quarter pricing being up in the 7% range it was flat with Q4. We did see an umbrella in excess of 14% DNO over 11.5% for example professional liability of 11%. But another area where we benefit disproportionately is commercial property. Commercial property was up 8.5%. We have a lot of that. That's very helpful to us. And of course there's all the coverage classes. About half of the coverage classes were up. And all account sizes were up in the 6.5% to 8.5% kind of range. So I would say for next quarter our outlook would be mid-single-digit organic growth. Even given the uncertainties there we feel very solid about that as we kind of move through. And we think there's upside in terms of the economy continued to benefit to drive even stronger new business. And I think we continue to mature as Bill pointed out with respect to our IRM process and that gives us a good positive growth as well. We did close one small acquisition in the quarter and we certainly expect to be open to do more of those throughout the balance of the year as well. So on balance we're really good about the prospects for the balance of 2021. Betsy, I'll tag on to that. Sorry, Betsy, I was just going to tag on just saying in the commercial community bank for example, we saw referral activity up 15% this past quarter, which is a really good number of household growth in all the commercial segments. So I think it's a function of what Bill was saying we're just beginning to see movement sort of across the board. We came into the first quarter of last year with a lot of excitement. And then second quarter with COVID, we all just sort of hit a wall. But the excitement sort of perseveres through the balance of the year. We just seen I think to a degree just consistent improvement sort of month-by-month. Consumer what we're seeing -- Erika, for consumer, what we're seeing right now is checking balances are about 30% higher and savings balances are up 140%. Obviously, a lot of that's driven by stimulus. But for lending to occur, there's got to be demand. And I think, we are seeing spending now on nondiscretionary type things which -- I mean at discretionary type of thing excuse me. And I think when cash depletes, there will be more lending, but it is tough today for home equity type products as a result of all these payments."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.\nAnkur Vyas: Thank you, Jess and good morning everyone. Welcome to Truist\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers, and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning\u2019s call, they will discuss Truist\u2019s fourth quarter results and share their perspectives on our continued activation of Truist\u2019s purpose, current business conditions and our outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures.

In addition, Truist is not responsible and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everybody and Happy New Year. Thank you for joining our call today. Truist delivered a strong finish to a pivotal and purposeful year. We completed our final integration and decommissioning activities and incurred the final set of merger-related costs. Adjusted PPNR grew a strong 12% sequentially, ahead of our guidance and helped us deliver on our commitment for positive operating leverage for the full year. We will cover the details on the quarter\u2019s results throughout the presentation and we will start with our purpose, the foundation of our company on Slide 4. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Our purpose is the foundation for our success as a company that drives performance and defines how we do business everyday. Slide 5 highlights many examples of how we activated our purpose in 2022. For our clients, our measurement is to provide distinctive, secure and successful experiences through touch and technology. We achieved a major milestone along that journey with the launch of Truist One Banking, our differentiated product suite that reimagines everyday banking and includes two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. These accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and we are very encouraged by the positive reception they have received from new and existing clients alike. Based on August through December data, which reflects Truist One, branch checking production increased 10% from a year ago period and we achieved this result despite having around 400 fewer branches. The Truist One suite now also includes our new cash reserve deposit base credit line up to $750, which launched in mid-December and expands our commitment to our clients and communities. Our ability to innovate at the intersection of touch and technology was greatly enhanced by the opening of our new innovation and technology center, which brings our cross-functional teams together with clients and large tech companies to reimagine banking experiences for everyone. We have already realized the benefits of the ITC as Truist One Banking and the new digital and hybrid investment capabilities launched throughout the year were all co-created client with clients and our client journey rooms. We also continued to deliver on our mission for our teammates. In October, we took a bold step to improve the lives of our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 an hour. In the 3 months since this took effect, we have experienced improved teammate recruitment, retention, lower turnover expenses, better execution and an all-around better client experience. We also enhanced our total rewards program to include an employee stock purchase program to further align our teammates\u2019 interest with those of our shareholders. As a company that champions diversity, equity and inclusion, we achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles a year early with aspirations for further progress. Finally, Truist has made a significant impact on the communities we serve by meeting and in some categories, exceeding our $60 billion community benefits plan. Our first inspirational commitment is Truist and one that has served as a framework for similar plans across the industry. The execution of this plan was a testament to our purpose of building better lives and communities by elevating low and moderate income and minority communities through material support for affordable housing, non-profit, small business and community development lending. In summary, we are delivering on our purpose and the significance of what our teammates have accomplished is just outstanding. We will continue to raise the bar and I look forward to the year ahead as we actualize our purpose, advance integrated relationship management, positively impact clients and communities through continued investment in touch and technology and make Truist an even better place to work. Now turning to Slide 7, selected items for the quarter totaled $170 million pre-tax and included our final charges related to the MOE. Now that our integration activities are complete, MOE costs will exit our run-rate going forward. This is a positive development for shareholders that underscores our pivot to execution and will simplify our narrative, enhance earnings quality and improve capital generation. Turning to our fourth quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. Truist delivered strong fourth quarter earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.20 per share on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.7 billion or $1.30 per share, up 5% sequentially as strong PPNR growth was partially offset by higher provision expense. Adjusted ROTCE was 30% and even excluding AOCI, was 20%. Both data points are very strong. Net interest income grew 7% to $4 billion, a new high for Truist, supported by strong loan growth and significant margin expansion resulted from higher short-term rates and well-controlled deposit costs. Fee income rebounded 6%, primarily due to insurance seasonality of full quarter of benefit mall results and investment banking. Adjusted expenses increased sequentially, mostly as expected as the impacts of higher minimum wage, acquisitions and targeted investments were partially offset by the final leg of some of our cost saving efforts. Together, these factors drove a 12% increase in adjusted PPNR exceeding our guidance. This performance also resulted in 370 basis points of adjusted operating leverage relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, our strongest operating leverage results for the year. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 54.2%, our best quarterly performance at Truist thus far. Asset quality remains strong and the sequential increase in provision expense primarily reflects moderately slower economic assumptions. We also deployed 10 basis points of capital as a result of strong organic loan growth and the BankDirect acquisition. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile and we remain confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios. Turning to our full year highlights on Slide 9. GAAP EPS was relatively stable year-over-year as significantly lower merger-related costs were offset by higher and more normal provision levels. Adjusted EPS declined 10% year-over-year, a solid 4.4% adjusted PPNR growth, was more than offset by the $1.6 billion increase in the loan loss provision expense. Importantly, however, we delivered 60 basis points of adjusted and 680 basis points of GAAP operating leverage for the full year, which was a primary metric to which we hold ourselves accountable to in 2022. This was our first year of operating leverage as Truist and it establishes a firm foundation, from which we can accelerate as we head into 2023. Turning to Slide 10, digital engagement rose steadily through 2022 as a result of changing client preferences and our improved agility as Truist. We experienced strong growth in digital transactions and Zelle, in particular, as transaction volume increased 42% since the beginning of the year. Zelle continues to represent an increasing percentage of our overall transaction mix and highlights the importance of continuing to invest in money movement capabilities. Our agility and responsiveness have improved tremendously since we have migrated to one digital platform built in the cloud, resulting in better client experiences. We delivered 3x as many production releases across retail, business and wealth in 2022 as we did in 2021. And as a result, our mobile app was rated at an average of 4.7 stars on Android and iOS at year end, up materially from a year ago. We introduced many new digital capabilities and solutions to clients in 2022 from Truist One Banking, Truist Assist and expanded digital investment capabilities, some of which are highlighted on the right side of the slide. In 2023, our goal is to more fully activate those capabilities with our clients to improve acquisition, retention and reduce cost. In addition to enhance digital capabilities for our clients, our digital and technology team successfully completed the largest bank merger in 15 years, decommissioned three data centers, successfully piloted a new deposit product on a next-gen real-time cloud-based core, enhanced credit decisioning and underwriting across certain consumer lending platforms and upgraded our contact center technology stack and completed a 5G network and branch WiFi pilot program. We have a great digital and technology team and they have been battle tested and have demonstrated incredible agility in responding to client needs during the integration period while also keeping their eyes on the future. Turning to loans and leases on Slide 11, average loan balances increased a strong $11.3 billion or 3.6% sequentially, approximately 20% of which came from the BankDirect acquisition. The improved loan growth we have experienced in recent quarters reflects our shift to execution and Truist\u2019s greater competitiveness for clients due to our size and capabilities as well as broader industry trends. C&I grew $7.2 billion or 4.7% overall and increased 3.2%, excluding BankDirect, as balances increased across most CIB industry verticals and product groups and CCB. As in recent quarters, growth continues to be strong within our Asset Finance Group as we continue to build that business with more talent, product capabilities and larger balance sheet. Macro trends such as supply chain management, infrastructure spending, inflation and choppy capital markets are also supporting growth here. CIB delivered growth across most industry verticals due to a combination of new client acquisition, uptiering our position with existing clients, acquisition activity and business-as-usual liquidity management. Commercial Community Bank C&I balances grew 3.7%, reflecting the strength of our markets and our team\u2019s focus on execution. Residential mortgage balances increased $3 billion or 5% sequentially due to previous correspondent channel production and lower prepayments. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances decreased on an end-of-period basis, primarily reflecting continued runoff in our student loan portfolio as well as our decision to pivot away from lower return portfolios such as prime auto. At the same time, we continue to invest in higher return consumer finance businesses, such as Service Finance, LightStream and Sheffield. Service Finance continues to grow and ended the year with over $3 billion worth of loans, ahead of high expectations at the time of the acquisition. Going forward, loan growth will moderate from the robust levels in 2022 as clients respond to the impact of higher rates, high inflation and a slowing economy. In addition, we also expect growth in residential mortgage and prime auto to continue to slow as we focus our capital on higher return opportunities. Truist remains well positioned to advise clients across a range of economic scenarios given our broad capability, talented teammates and increased capacity post-integration. Now turning to deposits on Slide 12. Average deposit balances decreased 1.6% sequentially as effects of tighter monetary policy, inflation and higher rate alternatives continue to weigh on balances. Deposit costs remained well controlled, reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise and our strategy to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. During the fourth quarter, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 52 basis points, contributing to a cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta of 27%, thus far. As the interest rate environment evolves, we will continue to take a balanced approach to maintaining and managing deposit growth and rate paid giving our broad access to alternative forms of funding. Our continued rollout of Truist One and ongoing investments in treasury and payments will be key areas of focus going forward as we look to acquire new and deepen existing relationships and maximize high-quality deposit growth. Now with that, let me turn it over to Mike.\nMike Maguire: Great. Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. I am going to begin on Slide 13. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income rose a very strong 7% to $4 billion, primarily due to ongoing margin expansion and strong loan growth. Deposit costs were well controlled and reflect the strength of our deposit franchise. Purchase accounting accretion decreased $19 million and is expected to continue to gradually diminish. Reported net interest margin increased 13 basis points and core net interest margin improved 15 basis points as a result of higher short-term interest rates alongside well-controlled deposit costs. Overall, we maintain a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, maintaining modest upside to higher short-term interest rates while having some downside protection when and if interest rates begin to decline. Looking to Slide 14, fee income rebounded during the quarter, increasing $125 million or 6% sequentially. The improvement was largely attributable to seasonality and insurance and the BenefitMall acquisition as well as higher investment banking and lending-related fee income. Insurance income increased $41 million, largely due to seasonality and a full quarter of BenefitMall results. Organic revenue for the full year grew 7% driven by a firm pricing environment, new business and strong retention. Investment banking and trading income increased $35 million as higher investment banking fees and strong core trading results in the quarter were partially offset by negative impacts from CVA/DVA. For the full year, investment banking income declined 37%, which we believe compares favorably to overall industry fee performance as the partnership between CIB and other lines of business continues to grow and earn momentum builds. Strategic hiring within CIB over the past 2 years has also led to improved lead table standards. Fee income declined 4% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by declines in market-sensitive businesses such as investment banking, wealth and mortgage and partially offset by organic and inorganic growth in insurance. Overdraft fees also declined from approximately $150 million in 4Q \u201821 to approximately $120 million in 4Q \u201822 as a result of the actions we took last year to eliminate a host of overdraft-related fees and the continued introduction of Truist One Banking to new existing clients. We expect overdraft fees to decline another 40% as we move from year end 2022 to year end 2024. While fee income remains below its potential, we are optimistic that our investments in key areas such as insurance, investment banking and wealth will payoff as markets normalize and our IRM execution continues to progress. Turning to Slide 15, reported non-interest expense increased $109 million or 3% sequentially. Merger and restructuring costs rose $18 million linked quarter and exceeded our October guide by $70 million due to higher-than-expected restructuring charges related to planned facility and branch reductions that will occur in 2023. These were business-as-usual decisions unrelated to the MOE and have solid financial returns. As Bill indicated, we will have no more restructuring charges or incremental operating expenses related to the MOE going forward. We would anticipate restructuring costs related to prior acquisition activity and other BAU expense normal rationalization efforts. It is difficult to forecast these with accuracy, but we would anticipate approximately $100 million to $125 million for 2023. Adjusted non-interest expense increased $68 million or 2% primarily due to the effects of our non-qualified plan. Excluding changes associated with the non-qualified plan, adjusted expense rose 0.6% sequentially, fairly consistent with our outlook from October. Personnel expense increased $84 million, half of which was from changes in the non-qualified plan and half of which was from the recent increase in our minimum wage. These increases were partially offset by a $35 million decrease in marketing expense and a $28 million reduction in other expense. The decline in other expense was driven by lower operational losses, which have decreased for two consecutive quarters, as recent investments in talent, technology, and process have begun to mitigate our fraud-related costs. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, adjusted non-interest expense grew by 8% as a result of the increase in minimum wage, investments in revenue-generating businesses, technology and acquisitions, higher call center staffing to support our clients post merger and a normalizing T&E spend. For the full year, adjusted expenses were $13.1 billion, up modestly from the $12.8 billion baseline in 2019. This performance is strong, reflecting the achievement of the $1.6 billion net cost save target. Overall, we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longer-term investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage. Below the line, our fourth quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of 16.7%, down from 18.2% in the third quarter, primarily due to annual true-ups for state income tax returns. Moving to Slide 16. Asset quality is strong, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio. Net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 34 basis points largely due to seasonality in indirect auto and lower recoveries. The allowance increased $172 million, reflecting strong loan growth and the ALLL ratio was stable at 1.34% as the effects of a moderately slower economic outlook were offset by high quality organic loan growth and the BankDirect acquisition. Excluding the BankDirect portfolio, which has extremely low losses through cycles, the ALLL ratio would have increased approximately 2 basis points. Continuing to Slide 17. Our CET1 ratio decreased from 9.1% to 9.0% as we deployed capital to support strong organic loan growth and close the BankDirect acquisition. We also continue to pay a strong dividend at $0.52 per share. Overall, our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile. We expect organic capital generation to improve in 2023 due to the elimination of MOE-related costs and more focused loan growth, all of which will provide additional flexibility and opportunities for Truist. Finally, our liquidity position remains strong with an average LCR of 112% and access to multiple funding sources. Our securities portfolio remains high quality at 97% government guaranteed and continues to produce approximately $3 billion of cash flow per quarter, which has supported our loan growth. Turning to Slide 18 where I\u2019ll provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. Looking into 1Q \u201823, we expect revenues to decline 2% to 3% relative to 4Q 2022, primarily driven by 2 fewer days impacting net interest income in addition to typical seasonal patterns in investment banking, card and payments and service charges, amongst other factors. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 1% to 2% as higher pension expense and FDIC premiums, along with seasonally higher personnel expenses are partially offset by ongoing cost discipline. For the full year 2023, we expect revenues to increase 7% to 9%, driven largely by strong net interest income growth and modestly improving fees. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 5% to 7% as a result of higher pension expense, higher FDIC premiums, the full annual impact of our minimum wage increase and acquisitions that closed throughout 2022. These four factors drive about 4% of our year-over-year increase. Given these factors, we are targeting adjusted operating leverage to be 200 basis points or greater, which would be more than 3x our pace in 2022. We also expect the net charge-off ratio to be between 35 and 50 basis points in 2023, given our expectations for continued normalization across the loan portfolio. Lastly, excluding discrete items, we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 19%, which translates to approximately 21% if you model it on a taxable equivalent basis. Now I\u2019ll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\nBill Rogers: Great. Thanks Mike. Continuing on Slide 19, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a year that was strategic and financial turning point for Truist. The pivot from integrating to operating is real, it\u2019s palpable and it can be evidenced across a number of dimensions. Loan production in the fourth quarter was near the highest it\u2019s been at Truist. This is despite some intentional reductions in certain consumer categories. Commercial Community Bank loan and deposit production in both the fourth quarter and full year was the strongest we\u2019ve had at Truist. Importantly, left lead relationships within CCB were up 36% in 2022, reflecting our increased strategic relevance and advisory capabilities with clients. Branch deposit and checking unit production in the fourth quarter increased 24% and 8%, respectively, compared to the year-ago quarter as teammates became more confident with processes and systems, but also improved solutions and capabilities. Our wealth line of business has had three consecutive quarters of adding net new advisers, and organic asset flows continue to be positive. Integrated relationship management activity across the company gained momentum throughout the year as a result of more focus, increased alignment and improved reporting as we ended the year with a 16% increase in qualified referral activity, excluding mortgage relative to 2021. Average client satisfaction scores for retail and small business banking are ascending and in the fourth quarter reached their highest levels of for the year in key areas that include our branches, call centers, retail digital experiences and small business. Our digital app ratings ended the year as one of the leaders in our peer group after starting near the bottom. The financial benefits of this momentum can be seen with the fourth quarter operating leverage being the strongest of the year and adjusted PPNR building each quarter. So to conclude on Slide 20, our fourth quarter results reaffirm that Truist is on the right path, and I\u2019m highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential to summarize our investment thesis. Our goal financially has produced strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. 2023 will be our first full year as Truist with zero integration activity, and our priorities are very clear: Core execution to actualize Truist and our purpose, harvesting IRM opportunities, continuing to digitize and automate our processes and operations and maintaining a strong profitability profile. We will also raise the bar on ourselves, focusing on the KPIs that drive total shareholder return and ensuring executive compensation targets reflects our potential, not just our business mix. While economic uncertainty remains high, Truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix, conservative credit culture, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, strong profitability profile and our strong risk-adjusted capital position and most notably, our significant performance momentum as we continue to shift from integration to executional excellence and purposeful growth. Ankur, let me turn it back over to you and begin the Q&A.\nAnkur Vyas: Thanks, Bill. Jess, at this time, if you would explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Can you hear me?\nBill Rogers: Yes, we got you.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Great. So it looks like \u2013 I\u2019m going to push the Corvette analogy. It looks like you\u2019re guiding for your Corvette of a franchise to go from first to second gear or maybe second or third, but you\u2019re guiding for twice as much revenue growth. You\u2019re guiding for 3x more operating leverage. But I and others are going to be unsure if you\u2019re going to be able to get that given your headcount\u2019s up 3% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter, you have NII pressures from deposits, and you have capital market headwinds. So I guess the question is, what\u2019s your degree of confidence with this 2023 guidance given some of the pressures and the internal expenses? And along with that, your merger saves, are they all in now? Or do you still get some payout effect that you benefit in the first quarter? I know you disconnected three data centers. Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yes. Yes, Mike, let me start with the last one first. Yes, they are all done. So we\u2019re \u2013 excuse me, entering the year with positive aspect of not sort of having those adjustments every quarter to talk about. And then as it relates to the confidence in our guidance, there is a lot of market uncertainty. So we have to accept that. I mean there is \u2013 things could change the inflation, what are clients going to be doing, but we know a lot of our own internal momentum. We talked about \u2013 I mean, your analogy of first, second or third or fourth. I don\u2019t know how any gears a Corvette has, but we continue to grind through that. So we have our own momentum that we\u2019re creating. And you saw that in some of the production numbers. I think you see that in some of the deposit betas. You see that in terms of our ability to, I think, outperform both in the asset and liability performance of our company as well as in the stability of some of the fee businesses. We\u2019ve got a great insurance business. We\u2019ve got great momentum within our investment banking business. It isn\u2019t just market-driven. I mean these are also relationships that we\u2019re developing with our commercial core businesses. So we\u2019re expanding our capabilities and our prowess. So while there are headwinds and we accept those and understand those, we have enough of our own tailwinds. I sort of call it, the Truist tailwind. That\u2019s just our increased performance, our increased capacity. And when offset those Mike, that\u2019s what gives me the confidence in the guidance is I can feel enough tailwinds to know that we can offset some of the headwinds that we may be facing.\nMike Mayo: And then a follow-up, you mentioned good insurance, maybe this is for you, Bill and Mike. You have an insurance operation where publicly comparable peers trade at like 3x the valuation of Truist. So lot of press, no comment from you guys. All you did present involving about this business. How do you think about monetizing some of that unrealized value that tracks value so that shareholders might benefit more? Or is this just part of your firm forever and you would never consider a move like that?\nBill Rogers: Yes, Mike, I mean, I think, one, I respect the question, but I think you\u2019ve got to respect that as it relates to specific market rumors or speculation, I just can\u2019t comment on that. But I can comment on the fact that we really like the insurance business. And we\u2019ve been in the insurance business for a long time. Just celebrated its 100th year anniversary. So that was sort of cool. We\u2019ve been supporting the insurance business from acquisitions. So they have been able to grow both, I think, very competitively from organic and inorganic basis, but it\u2019s also a consolidating business. We want to make sure that we\u2019re always providing the right level of support for that insurance business to continue to grow and continue to be really valuable contribution for our shareholders.\nMike Mayo: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering if you can provide us a little breakdown detail between \u2013 inside your revenue growth guide for the year, just generally speaking, what are you expecting for NII versus fees? And what rate curve are you using in your NII forecast?\nMike Maguire: Ken, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll take that one. I guess starting with the last question on the rate curve. Our outlook is that we will see two rate hikes in the first quarter, 25 a piece in February and March and see a policy rate stable until November, where we would expect a cut, which obviously, at the end of the year, probably doesn\u2019t have much of an impact on our NII perspective. Breaking revenue for the year into two components. From an NII perspective, the way I\u2019d think about it is we obviously had really strong growth in 2022. The second half, in particular, also had very nice margin expansion. So we have a really nice exit velocity from an NII perspective. We believe we have a little bit of asset sensitivity left. So we do have the opportunity to realize some of the upside of the hikes in the first quarter and we will have, as Bill mentioned, slowing loan growth. But those two factors combined, we think, give us a stable outlook for Q1 NII. And then for the rest of the year, that we believe we will stay relatively stable, some pressure on the NIMs offset by some modest amount of loan growth. On a year-over-year basis, just given the average loan growth that we would expect that will be, we think, a very nice growth. And frankly, we will drive the majority of the growth potential in the revenue guide. From a fee perspective, I think a couple of puts and a few takes. We expect to continue to have good performance from the insurance business, which is growing nicely on an organic basis as well as realizing the full benefit of the acquisitions that we completed in 2022. Our investment banking business, we believe, has some potential to benefit from improvements in market conditions, probably more likely in the second half than the first half. And then I think we will have a little bit of pressure. We would expect there to be pressure on the on the residential mortgage business as well as the service charges and overdraft fees on deposits.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Great. And then a follow-up on deposits, 27% cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta through the fourth quarter. You guys were in the mid-30s last time. I don\u2019t think yet you\u2019ve given us an idea of what you think the cumulative could be this cycle, any views on that at this point in terms of the direction and the endpoint? Thank you.\nMike Maguire: Yes, Ken. I\u2019ll take that one again. Look, I\u2019ve been very pleased by how the betas have performed so far. They have outperformed our expectations on a pretty consistent basis. We obviously are seeing some acceleration of rate pursuing behaviors and seeing pressures on balances as well, uncharted territory in many respects. We think we will get through the last cycle, perhaps even high 30s, approaching and even hitting 40% by the time we\u2019re to the last hike.\nBill Rogers: And again, it\u2019s Bill. The only thing I\u2019d add is just the strength of our deposit franchise. So you said I asked about our relative deposit beta performance. But we\u2019re really experiencing what we hope we would experience as Truist. We\u2019re sitting in great markets. We\u2019ve got a 21% average share, our competitors\u2019 mainly large banks. We\u2019ve introduced some great new product capability in Truist One. Our branch production\u2019s up. Our teammates are really doing a great job, the ubiquity of presence, the ability to amortize your marketing and be more effective. So our just strength of our overall deposit franchise is starting to manifest itself and show itself of what we thought we could create and create at Truist.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you talk about your capital priorities and remind us what your near-term capital targets, please?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Matt, our priorities remain the same in terms of the top four priorities. The first is to continue to invest in our business. And we\u2019ve seen a lot of opportunity to do that. I mean you\u2019ve seen the asset growth in our business and RWA growth, and we feel really good about the opportunities to invest in that. The second is to have a secure and growing dividend base. That\u2019s important to our \u2013 both our institutional and our retail shareholders. So that\u2019s a critical. And then the third is M&A opportunities, inorganic opportunities. And you\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve been active. They have been \u2013 some have been smaller by nature, but we\u2019ve seen opportunities to enhance our businesses mostly in the insurance business, but also on the technology side and some capability side and some talent side that we\u2019ve added in those areas. And then the fourth is the \u2013 is share repurchase. And for us, that just hasn\u2019t been as big a priority because we\u2019ve done a lot in the first three of those priorities. And as it relates to target, I mean, we\u2019ve been sort of careful to say we really \u2013 we like where we\u2019re operating right now. So we think we have got the capacity to do the things we need to do. We think given our risk profile, given our stress adjusted risk profile, we think we\u2019re in a really strong position from a capital perspective. But also, as Mike noted in his comments, we accrete. If you think about our earnings profile, but also the fact that our MOE expenses come off, we are sort of in a unique position to accrete capital. So, we will accrete about 25 basis points worth of capital. We have been using some of that for those first two, three priorities that we talked about. So, I think on balance, we will probably see capital increase, but we are comfortable that we have got enough capital to execute our strategies and support our businesses.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then so hypothetically, if you say won the lottery for $5 billion, what would you do with that capital? I don\u2019t think you are going to change the organic growth. The dividend is kind of tapped by regulation, roughly, the last two buckets of M&A and buybacks. And if you walk into that $5 billion, what would you do with it?\nBill Rogers: I don\u2019t want to answer a hypothetical lottery question because we are not lottery ticket buyers. That\u2019s not part of our strategy. I think we have got that\u2019s really based on, can we support our businesses long-term. And can we provide the capital they need to grow. And we are going to use all of our strategies and all of our capabilities to ensure that we are supporting businesses and their growth.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John McDonald at Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn McDonald: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how you see credit unfolding for Truist this year and what you have baked into the charge-off guidance that you gave for this year?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Clarke, will you take that?\nClarke Starnes: John, this is Clarke. I will take that one. As you saw, we had 34 basis points in losses in Q4. That reflected primarily seasonality \u2013 normal seasonality in our consumer segments and a little bit of normalization. And as Mike mentioned, we had lower recoveries in our wholesale areas. So, that\u2019s what the delta was from Q3 to Q4. And then what we are seeing is the consumer segments are normalizing. And also just to remind you all that the whole industry has had anemic wholesale and CRE losses over the last couple of years. So, we are pretty similar to that. So therefore, we would expect losses to return towards the lower range of our long-term loss range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points as we go through \u201823, and it just depends upon how the economy performs. And that\u2019s why you see that reflected in our guidance of 35 bps to 50 bps.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thanks Clarke and then for Mike. Mike, on the expense outlook for adjusted expense growth, mid-single digits, how much of that is kind of pulling through acquisitions you added at the end of last year? And how much of that is kind of core expense growth and investments? Thanks.\nMike Maguire: Sure. In \u201823, I believe the annualized M&A impact is $127-or-so million. So, that\u2019s about 1% of that growth. You recall in the guide, we talked about these four components that were \u2013 where we have quite a bit of visibility into and frankly, not much flexibility, and that\u2019s the pension, the M&A impact, the annualized impact of minimum wage and the FDIC expense. And those components in the aggregate are about 4%. Hope that helps.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Got it. Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala at Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just one follow-up, Bill, on the capital allocation question. One, just given \u2013 I mean there is obviously a lot of speculation when you talk to investors around the insurance business. Like if you can talk to, given the multiple difference between insurance companies trading at 20x PE, do you still think it makes sense in terms of deploying capital to do more acquisitions on the insurance front as opposed to buying back stock? And on the other hand, I would love to hear how you would think about maybe moving away from that business, but giving up a very defensible revenue stream?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Ebrahim, again, I am not going to comment on sort of where we are from a speculative standpoint, other than to say, we love the insurance business. We want the insurance business to grow. We have done, I am staring at John, probably 100 acquisitions over time. So, we have got a really good framework in assisting that business to grow. But as I mentioned in my earlier comments, it is a consolidated business. So, we want to make sure that we have got all the flexibility and capability to create capital and support all of our businesses and their growth.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And I guess just taking a step back with the merger integration done, the cost behind you. Remind us in terms of like what we have not heard so far on the call is the scale benefits as we think about go forward in terms of picking up bigger deals on the lending side, on the fee revenue side? Just remind us some of the revenue synergies we should expect from the Truist franchise on a go-forward basis and why you can outperform just the peers within the market or within your asset size set?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Great question. And one of them I talked about just a minute ago was the deposit franchise. So, the scale, and the ubiquity, and the size, and the prowess that we have in our markets, I think is a distinct advantage and you see that. The other component of that is the markets that we are in. So, not only is it scale, but at scale in the right places. So, we have markets that I think will sustain sort of any economic environment with higher beta to the upside and a lower beta to the downside, so, in markets where we have a lot of in-migration versus out-migration and business development and growth. So, that\u2019s one component. You mentioned the capital markets side, and I have talked about the community bank, the prowess that we have seen there, 36% increase in left leads and those type things. That comes from scale. That comes from an ability to be more relevant to our clients, to have discussions with them that we weren\u2019t having before, to be more strategic and to be in that left lead spot versus that right lead spot. And we all know the economics of that. I mean the economics are multiples of where you are in the spectrum. So, our relevance is not only related to our scale, but also related to our product and capabilities. We have tried to sort of put a number on that. And I would say sort of back-of-the-envelope kind of math, I mean it\u2019s at least 10% of some of the growth that we have seen in our investment banking business, we could attribute to being more scale-oriented, again, not taking outsized positions, but taking positions that are on the left versus the right and the economics that come along with that. And then everything to do with all the operations and efficiency, so, everything to do with the base that we operate from. We just had more opportunity to create more efficiency. So, when we do something that has previously had tens of millions of dollars of impact. Today, it can have $50 million and $60 million of impact because you are doing it across a bigger base and a bigger capability. The ability to negotiate better contracts with our providers and our partners and we saw a lot of that in the merger. Our ability to go in and be more relevant and more important to them, get terms that we think better reflect that. Mike, what else am I forgetting in that list because it\u2019s a long list, I mean it\u2019s a great question and one we probably ought to talk more about.\nMike Maguire: Yes. I think it\u2019s been moving more relevant on capabilities, more relevant on size. You are seeing it in the results, whether it would be the ability to manage expenses.\nBill Rogers: The financial markets, our pricing on debt deals.\nMike Maguire: Yes, exactly right.\nBill Rogers: So, the list is pretty long.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Scouten at Piper Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAnkur Vyas: Stephen, are you there. Maybe, Jess, we go to the next person. See if Stephen can get back in after.\nOperator: Absolutely. We will do that. We will go back to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning Bill and good morning Mike. Can you guys share with us, you have got some good guidance on the operating leverage for 2023 being, I think Mike, you said about 3x the level of what you achieved in 2022. But I noticed that in the third quarter and fourth quarters, the operating leverage was higher than what you are hoping to achieve in \u201823. Can you share with us why there seems to be some slowdown in that operating leverage relative to the fourth quarter or third quarters of 2022?\nMike Maguire: Yes. Sure, Gerard. As we look into \u201823, I think a couple of factors. One, we \u2013 obviously, 2022 was a year where we had outsized, particularly in the second half, loan growth and net interest margin expansion, which obviously was a great tailwind on the revenue side. As we look into \u201823, we expect to continue to have nice growth from a year-over-year perspective, but we are expecting that NII trend to really stabilize. And frankly, we are going to begin to experience some pressure on the NIM side probably in the second quarter. From an expense perspective, we also mentioned, there are a few just structural expenses that are in the plan for \u201823 that when combined, add up to about 4% year-over-year change. We obviously intend to make investments beyond those four categories in our clients and our teammates and in other strategic investment priorities. But that structural expense growth is there. So, again, we feel good about that sort of 2% with upside operating leverage guide and feel good about our \u2013 frankly, our revenue guide as well. So, hopefully, that\u2019s helpful to you.\nGerard Cassidy: Good. No, I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, many of you \u2013 or many of your peers and yourselves are obviously building up loan loss reserves. The outlooks that people are using, are calling for a weaker economy, but we don\u2019t seem to be seeing that yet in any of the numbers. And if you look at the spreads in the high-yield market, they haven\u2019t blown out. One of your competitors or peers, as they pointed out that the spreads in commercial loans still are pretty tight. So, I don\u2019t know, Bill, when you talk to your customers, what are they seeing that maybe we might not see as much of a downturn as everybody is kind of forecasting right now later this year?\nBill Rogers: Yes. I mean I think you pointed out, I mean the data are confusing. There is just no doubt about that. I mean you see some positives and you see some negatives. If you look at \u2013 just think about the last few days, retail sales were not really very strong, sort of a poor Christmas selling season. You have seen inflation being a bigger part of what people do, and supply chain seems to sort of be reconciling itself. So, I think it\u2019s more of a perspective, just \u2013 there has to be a higher impact from higher inflation. And whether that\u2019s reduced hiring from our clients, whether that\u2019s reduced capital investment, and all those type things. And in fairness, it\u2019s a little more prospective. So, when we talk to our clients and we look at our portfolios today, things are great. I mean as Clarke mentioned, our commercial portfolio looks fantastic. Our clients are in really good shape. But rents will come due, things will \u2013 payments will come due, things will change over time. So, I think it\u2019s just a little more of trying to understand where the economy is puck\u2019s going versus where it is today, because I think today, it actually looks pretty strong. Clarke, what would you add to that?\nClarke Starnes: Well, I would just say, to your point, Bill, clients\u2019 balance sheets, their liquidity, their financial positions are very good going into this. Obviously, depending on what happens in the economy, the impact of the higher rates, input costs, all of these things, we are monitoring very closely with our clients. Gerard, we are looking at things like CRE and the term risk and things like office. So, I think we are just looking out what could be some of those impacts from the \u2013 if the economy does slow and obviously, that\u2019s reflected in everyone\u2019s provisioning models. But to your point, the actual performance to-date and the near-term outlook is still strong.\nBill Rogers: Consumer side, I mean on the consumer side, it is normalizing and in some cases, normalized to where we are right now. So, you do start to see some of that. We have done a lot of work looking at sort of our lower-income borrowers and some of the challenges that they may be facing from inflation. Maybe they are not facing it today, but that\u2019s starting to build as they start to withdraw a little more deposits. So, it is more of a prospective thing than a current thing and we are all trying to find the right calibration of where things might land. And we don\u2019t want to undershoot that runway. I mean we want to be conservative. We want to be appropriate and think through all the risk that could exist in the portfolio.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nBill Rogers: Great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nBill Rogers: Hi Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. I just want to understand a little bit more. I know we touched in a couple of different ways, but you have got the revenue outlook for 2023, up 7% to 9%. And what I am hearing is loan growth slowing slightly from the 11% level you have now, but really not that much and that the fees \u2013 fee growth will be lower due to some of the things you have mentioned around mortgage. But that loan growth is likely to be a little bit above that adjusted revenue number with the pressure coming a little bit in fees and then also NIM pulling back in the back half of the year. Is that a fair summary?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Betsy, I think I would say it maybe a little bit differently. And I think Mike was trying to make this point. I mean we are sort of \u2013 if you look at sort of NII for the fourth quarter, and we are assuming that sort of stable through the year. So, that\u2019s the big driver. I mean if you think about what\u2019s the big bus and the revenue guidance, it\u2019s NII being stable. And that\u2019s not loan growth at the kind of revenue numbers. I mean the loan growth is going to pull back a little bit. Some of that\u2019s going to be intentional on our part. A lot of it\u2019s going to be return-oriented, just making sure that we have got really, really great relevance with our clients. And in some cases, the fee business is we expect to be up. We expect insurance to be up. We expect it to continue in its sort of high-single digit organic growth. We still have some inorganic momentum from some of the acquisitions we have gotten. We expect investment banking to actually return and increase its revenue growth. That will probably be a little more back-end weighted in fairness, but as we see where markets come out. But the big driver is sort of the NII fourth quarter where we are and that moving forward on a stabilized basis. That\u2019s the biggest driver.\nBetsy Graseck: And I know in the press release, you talked a bit about having \u2013 managing your deposit costs well and tightly, etcetera. Can you give us a sense as to how you think about the trajectory of that line item as we go through \u201823?\nBill Rogers: Yes. I will do it at a high level. I mean it will be \u2013 continue to be slightly down. So, I mean I think that\u2019s \u2013 that trend will continue. I think on a relative basis, we are showing deposit betas that are more reflective of our opportunity. And as the costs continue to grow, I mean deposit betas will increase. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment sort of specifically how we are thinking about that.\nMike Maguire: Yes. We mentioned in an earlier question that we see betas increasing. Whether they reach the 40% level or not, we will see. I would say the other trend, Betsy, which is consistent with what others are expecting and what\u2019s consistent with our expectation is we are still seeing a remixing from DDA and interest-bearing so that makes sense. And we are still well above where we were sort of pre-stimulus. We were in the high-20s, 28%, 29%. We peaked during the sort of height of stimulus in the 35.5%, 36%. We are back at like 34% right now and going to 33% and probably approaching 30% over time. And I think, Bill, you hit it right. I mean I think we are seeing some deposit balance pressure in the aggregate and we would expect that to continue in 2023, perhaps moderate a bit.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Got it.\nMike Maguire: That\u2019s great.\nAnkur Vyas: Alright. Thanks Betsy. Jess, it looks like there is not anyone left in the queue, so that completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you all for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Jess, you can now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation.

            "content": "Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everybody and Happy New Year. Thank you for joining our call today. Truist delivered a strong finish to a pivotal and purposeful year. We completed our final integration and decommissioning activities and incurred the final set of merger-related costs. Adjusted PPNR grew a strong 12% sequentially, ahead of our guidance and helped us deliver on our commitment for positive operating leverage for the full year. We will cover the details on the quarter's results throughout the presentation and we will start with our purpose, the foundation of our company on Slide 4. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Our purpose is the foundation for our success as a company that drives performance and defines how we do business everyday. Slide 5 highlights many examples of how we activated our purpose in 2022. For our clients, our measurement is to provide distinctive, secure and successful experiences through touch and technology. We achieved a major milestone along that journey with the launch of Truist One Banking, our differentiated product suite that reimagines everyday banking and includes two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. These accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and we are very encouraged by the positive reception they have received from new and existing clients alike. Based on August through December data, which reflects Truist One, branch checking production increased 10% from a year ago period and we achieved this result despite having around 400 fewer branches. The Truist One suite now also includes our new cash reserve deposit base credit line up to $750, which launched in mid-December and expands our commitment to our clients and communities. Our ability to innovate at the intersection of touch and technology was greatly enhanced by the opening of our new innovation and technology center, which brings our cross-functional teams together with clients and large tech companies to reimagine banking experiences for everyone. We have already realized the benefits of the ITC as Truist One Banking and the new digital and hybrid investment capabilities launched throughout the year were all co-created client with clients and our client journey rooms. We also continued to deliver on our mission for our teammates. In October, we took a bold step to improve the lives of our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 an hour. In the 3 months since this took effect, we have experienced improved teammate recruitment, retention, lower turnover expenses, better execution and an all-around better client experience. We also enhanced our total rewards program to include an employee stock purchase program to further align our teammates' interest with those of our shareholders. As a company that champions diversity, equity and inclusion, we achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles a year early with aspirations for further progress. Finally, Truist has made a significant impact on the communities we serve by meeting and in some categories, exceeding our $60 billion community benefits plan. Our first inspirational commitment is Truist and one that has served as a framework for similar plans across the industry. The execution of this plan was a testament to our purpose of building better lives and communities by elevating low and moderate income and minority communities through material support for affordable housing, non-profit, small business and community development lending. In summary, we are delivering on our purpose and the significance of what our teammates have accomplished is just outstanding. We will continue to raise the bar and I look forward to the year ahead as we actualize our purpose, advance integrated relationship management, positively impact clients and communities through continued investment in touch and technology and make Truist an even better place to work. Now turning to Slide 7, selected items for the quarter totaled $170 million pre-tax and included our final charges related to the MOE. Now that our integration activities are complete, MOE costs will exit our run-rate going forward. This is a positive development for shareholders that underscores our pivot to execution and will simplify our narrative, enhance earnings quality and improve capital generation. Turning to our fourth quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. Truist delivered strong fourth quarter earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.20 per share on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.7 billion or $1.30 per share, up 5% sequentially as strong PPNR growth was partially offset by higher provision expense. Adjusted ROTCE was 30% and even excluding AOCI, was 20%. Both data points are very strong. Net interest income grew 7% to $4 billion, a new high for Truist, supported by strong loan growth and significant margin expansion resulted from higher short-term rates and well-controlled deposit costs. Fee income rebounded 6%, primarily due to insurance seasonality of full quarter of benefit mall results and investment banking. Adjusted expenses increased sequentially, mostly as expected as the impacts of higher minimum wage, acquisitions and targeted investments were partially offset by the final leg of some of our cost saving efforts. Together, these factors drove a 12% increase in adjusted PPNR exceeding our guidance. This performance also resulted in 370 basis points of adjusted operating leverage relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, our strongest operating leverage results for the year. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 54.2%, our best quarterly performance at Truist thus far. Asset quality remains strong and the sequential increase in provision expense primarily reflects moderately slower economic assumptions. We also deployed 10 basis points of capital as a result of strong organic loan growth and the BankDirect acquisition. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile and we remain confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios. Turning to our full year highlights on Slide 9. GAAP EPS was relatively stable year-over-year as significantly lower merger-related costs were offset by higher and more normal provision levels. Adjusted EPS declined 10% year-over-year, a solid 4.4% adjusted PPNR growth, was more than offset by the $1.6 billion increase in the loan loss provision expense. Importantly, however, we delivered 60 basis points of adjusted and 680 basis points of GAAP operating leverage for the full year, which was a primary metric to which we hold ourselves accountable to in 2022. This was our first year of operating leverage as Truist and it establishes a firm foundation, from which we can accelerate as we head into 2023. Turning to Slide 10, digital engagement rose steadily through 2022 as a result of changing client preferences and our improved agility as Truist. We experienced strong growth in digital transactions and Zelle, in particular, as transaction volume increased 42% since the beginning of the year. Zelle continues to represent an increasing percentage of our overall transaction mix and highlights the importance of continuing to invest in money movement capabilities. Our agility and responsiveness have improved tremendously since we have migrated to one digital platform built in the cloud, resulting in better client experiences. We delivered 3x as many production releases across retail, business and wealth in 2022 as we did in 2021. And as a result, our mobile app was rated at an average of 4.7 stars on Android and iOS at year end, up materially from a year ago. We introduced many new digital capabilities and solutions to clients in 2022 from Truist One Banking, Truist Assist and expanded digital investment capabilities, some of which are highlighted on the right side of the slide. In 2023, our goal is to more fully activate those capabilities with our clients to improve acquisition, retention and reduce cost. In addition to enhance digital capabilities for our clients, our digital and technology team successfully completed the largest bank merger in 15 years, decommissioned three data centers, successfully piloted a new deposit product on a next-gen real-time cloud-based core, enhanced credit decisioning and underwriting across certain consumer lending platforms and upgraded our contact center technology stack and completed a 5G network and branch WiFi pilot program. We have a great digital and technology team and they have been battle tested and have demonstrated incredible agility in responding to client needs during the integration period while also keeping their eyes on the future. Turning to loans and leases on Slide 11, average loan balances increased a strong $11.3 billion or 3.6% sequentially, approximately 20% of which came from the BankDirect acquisition. The improved loan growth we have experienced in recent quarters reflects our shift to execution and Truist's greater competitiveness for clients due to our size and capabilities as well as broader industry trends. C&I grew $7.2 billion or 4.7% overall and increased 3.2%, excluding BankDirect, as balances increased across most CIB industry verticals and product groups and CCB. As in recent quarters, growth continues to be strong within our Asset Finance Group as we continue to build that business with more talent, product capabilities and larger balance sheet. Macro trends such as supply chain management, infrastructure spending, inflation and choppy capital markets are also supporting growth here. CIB delivered growth across most industry verticals due to a combination of new client acquisition, uptiering our position with existing clients, acquisition activity and business-as-usual liquidity management. Commercial Community Bank C&I balances grew 3.7%, reflecting the strength of our markets and our team's focus on execution. Residential mortgage balances increased $3 billion or 5% sequentially due to previous correspondent channel production and lower prepayments. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances decreased on an end-of-period basis, primarily reflecting continued runoff in our student loan portfolio as well as our decision to pivot away from lower return portfolios such as prime auto. At the same time, we continue to invest in higher return consumer finance businesses, such as Service Finance, LightStream and Sheffield. Service Finance continues to grow and ended the year with over $3 billion worth of loans, ahead of high expectations at the time of the acquisition. Going forward, loan growth will moderate from the robust levels in 2022 as clients respond to the impact of higher rates, high inflation and a slowing economy. In addition, we also expect growth in residential mortgage and prime auto to continue to slow as we focus our capital on higher return opportunities. Truist remains well positioned to advise clients across a range of economic scenarios given our broad capability, talented teammates and increased capacity post-integration. Now turning to deposits on Slide 12. Average deposit balances decreased 1.6% sequentially as effects of tighter monetary policy, inflation and higher rate alternatives continue to weigh on balances. Deposit costs remained well controlled, reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise and our strategy to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. During the fourth quarter, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 52 basis points, contributing to a cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta of 27%, thus far. As the interest rate environment evolves, we will continue to take a balanced approach to maintaining and managing deposit growth and rate paid giving our broad access to alternative forms of funding. Our continued rollout of Truist One and ongoing investments in treasury and payments will be key areas of focus going forward as we look to acquire new and deepen existing relationships and maximize high-quality deposit growth. Now with that, let me turn it over to Mike. Great. Thanks Mike. Continuing on Slide 19, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a year that was strategic and financial turning point for Truist. The pivot from integrating to operating is real, it's palpable and it can be evidenced across a number of dimensions. Loan production in the fourth quarter was near the highest it's been at Truist. This is despite some intentional reductions in certain consumer categories. Commercial Community Bank loan and deposit production in both the fourth quarter and full year was the strongest we've had at Truist. Importantly, left lead relationships within CCB were up 36% in 2022, reflecting our increased strategic relevance and advisory capabilities with clients. Branch deposit and checking unit production in the fourth quarter increased 24% and 8%, respectively, compared to the year-ago quarter as teammates became more confident with processes and systems, but also improved solutions and capabilities. Our wealth line of business has had three consecutive quarters of adding net new advisers, and organic asset flows continue to be positive. Integrated relationship management activity across the company gained momentum throughout the year as a result of more focus, increased alignment and improved reporting as we ended the year with a 16% increase in qualified referral activity, excluding mortgage relative to 2021. Average client satisfaction scores for retail and small business banking are ascending and in the fourth quarter reached their highest levels of for the year in key areas that include our branches, call centers, retail digital experiences and small business. Our digital app ratings ended the year as one of the leaders in our peer group after starting near the bottom. The financial benefits of this momentum can be seen with the fourth quarter operating leverage being the strongest of the year and adjusted PPNR building each quarter. So to conclude on Slide 20, our fourth quarter results reaffirm that Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential to summarize our investment thesis. Our goal financially has produced strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. 2023 will be our first full year as Truist with zero integration activity, and our priorities are very clear: Core execution to actualize Truist and our purpose, harvesting IRM opportunities, continuing to digitize and automate our processes and operations and maintaining a strong profitability profile. We will also raise the bar on ourselves, focusing on the KPIs that drive total shareholder return and ensuring executive compensation targets reflects our potential, not just our business mix. While economic uncertainty remains high, Truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix, conservative credit culture, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, strong profitability profile and our strong risk-adjusted capital position and most notably, our significant performance momentum as we continue to shift from integration to executional excellence and purposeful growth. Ankur, let me turn it back over to you and begin the Q&A. Yes, we got you. Yes. Yes, Mike, let me start with the last one first. Yes, they are all done. So we're \u2013 excuse me, entering the year with positive aspect of not sort of having those adjustments every quarter to talk about. And then as it relates to the confidence in our guidance, there is a lot of market uncertainty. So we have to accept that. I mean there is \u2013 things could change the inflation, what are clients going to be doing, but we know a lot of our own internal momentum. We talked about \u2013 I mean, your analogy of first, second or third or fourth. I don't know how any gears a Corvette has, but we continue to grind through that. So we have our own momentum that we're creating. And you saw that in some of the production numbers. I think you see that in some of the deposit betas. You see that in terms of our ability to, I think, outperform both in the asset and liability performance of our company as well as in the stability of some of the fee businesses. We've got a great insurance business. We've got great momentum within our investment banking business. It isn't just market-driven. I mean these are also relationships that we're developing with our commercial core businesses. So we're expanding our capabilities and our prowess. So while there are headwinds and we accept those and understand those, we have enough of our own tailwinds. I sort of call it, the Truist tailwind. That's just our increased performance, our increased capacity. And when offset those Mike, that's what gives me the confidence in the guidance is I can feel enough tailwinds to know that we can offset some of the headwinds that we may be facing. Yes, Mike, I mean, I think, one, I respect the question, but I think you've got to respect that as it relates to specific market rumors or speculation, I just can't comment on that. But I can comment on the fact that we really like the insurance business. And we've been in the insurance business for a long time. Just celebrated its 100th year anniversary. So that was sort of cool. We've been supporting the insurance business from acquisitions. So they have been able to grow both, I think, very competitively from organic and inorganic basis, but it's also a consolidating business. We want to make sure that we're always providing the right level of support for that insurance business to continue to grow and continue to be really valuable contribution for our shareholders. And again, it's Bill. The only thing I'd add is just the strength of our deposit franchise. So you said I asked about our relative deposit beta performance. But we're really experiencing what we hope we would experience as Truist. We're sitting in great markets. We've got a 21% average share, our competitors' mainly large banks. We've introduced some great new product capability in Truist One. Our branch production's up. Our teammates are really doing a great job, the ubiquity of presence, the ability to amortize your marketing and be more effective. So our just strength of our overall deposit franchise is starting to manifest itself and show itself of what we thought we could create and create at Truist. Yes. Matt, our priorities remain the same in terms of the top four priorities. The first is to continue to invest in our business. And we've seen a lot of opportunity to do that. I mean you've seen the asset growth in our business and RWA growth, and we feel really good about the opportunities to invest in that. The second is to have a secure and growing dividend base. That's important to our \u2013 both our institutional and our retail shareholders. So that's a critical. And then the third is M&A opportunities, inorganic opportunities. And you've seen we've been active. They have been \u2013 some have been smaller by nature, but we've seen opportunities to enhance our businesses mostly in the insurance business, but also on the technology side and some capability side and some talent side that we've added in those areas. And then the fourth is the \u2013 is share repurchase. And for us, that just hasn't been as big a priority because we've done a lot in the first three of those priorities. And as it relates to target, I mean, we've been sort of careful to say we really \u2013 we like where we're operating right now. So we think we have got the capacity to do the things we need to do. We think given our risk profile, given our stress adjusted risk profile, we think we're in a really strong position from a capital perspective. But also, as Mike noted in his comments, we accrete. If you think about our earnings profile, but also the fact that our MOE expenses come off, we are sort of in a unique position to accrete capital. So, we will accrete about 25 basis points worth of capital. We have been using some of that for those first two, three priorities that we talked about. So, I think on balance, we will probably see capital increase, but we are comfortable that we have got enough capital to execute our strategies and support our businesses. I don't want to answer a hypothetical lottery question because we are not lottery ticket buyers. That's not part of our strategy. I think we have got that's really based on, can we support our businesses long-term. And can we provide the capital they need to grow. And we are going to use all of our strategies and all of our capabilities to ensure that we are supporting businesses and their growth. Thanks Matt. Yes. Clarke, will you take that? Good morning. Yes. Ebrahim, again, I am not going to comment on sort of where we are from a speculative standpoint, other than to say, we love the insurance business. We want the insurance business to grow. We have done, I am staring at John, probably 100 acquisitions over time. So, we have got a really good framework in assisting that business to grow. But as I mentioned in my earlier comments, it is a consolidated business. So, we want to make sure that we have got all the flexibility and capability to create capital and support all of our businesses and their growth. Yes. Great question. And one of them I talked about just a minute ago was the deposit franchise. So, the scale, and the ubiquity, and the size, and the prowess that we have in our markets, I think is a distinct advantage and you see that. The other component of that is the markets that we are in. So, not only is it scale, but at scale in the right places. So, we have markets that I think will sustain sort of any economic environment with higher beta to the upside and a lower beta to the downside, so, in markets where we have a lot of in-migration versus out-migration and business development and growth. So, that's one component. You mentioned the capital markets side, and I have talked about the community bank, the prowess that we have seen there, 36% increase in left leads and those type things. That comes from scale. That comes from an ability to be more relevant to our clients, to have discussions with them that we weren't having before, to be more strategic and to be in that left lead spot versus that right lead spot. And we all know the economics of that. I mean the economics are multiples of where you are in the spectrum. So, our relevance is not only related to our scale, but also related to our product and capabilities. We have tried to sort of put a number on that. And I would say sort of back-of-the-envelope kind of math, I mean it's at least 10% of some of the growth that we have seen in our investment banking business, we could attribute to being more scale-oriented, again, not taking outsized positions, but taking positions that are on the left versus the right and the economics that come along with that. And then everything to do with all the operations and efficiency, so, everything to do with the base that we operate from. We just had more opportunity to create more efficiency. So, when we do something that has previously had tens of millions of dollars of impact. Today, it can have $50 million and $60 million of impact because you are doing it across a bigger base and a bigger capability. The ability to negotiate better contracts with our providers and our partners and we saw a lot of that in the merger. Our ability to go in and be more relevant and more important to them, get terms that we think better reflect that. Mike, what else am I forgetting in that list because it's a long list, I mean it's a great question and one we probably ought to talk more about. The financial markets, our pricing on debt deals. So, the list is pretty long. Yes. I mean I think you pointed out, I mean the data are confusing. There is just no doubt about that. I mean you see some positives and you see some negatives. If you look at \u2013 just think about the last few days, retail sales were not really very strong, sort of a poor Christmas selling season. You have seen inflation being a bigger part of what people do, and supply chain seems to sort of be reconciling itself. So, I think it's more of a perspective, just \u2013 there has to be a higher impact from higher inflation. And whether that's reduced hiring from our clients, whether that's reduced capital investment, and all those type things. And in fairness, it's a little more prospective. So, when we talk to our clients and we look at our portfolios today, things are great. I mean as Clarke mentioned, our commercial portfolio looks fantastic. Our clients are in really good shape. But rents will come due, things will \u2013 payments will come due, things will change over time. So, I think it's just a little more of trying to understand where the economy is puck's going versus where it is today, because I think today, it actually looks pretty strong. Clarke, what would you add to that? Consumer side, I mean on the consumer side, it is normalizing and in some cases, normalized to where we are right now. So, you do start to see some of that. We have done a lot of work looking at sort of our lower-income borrowers and some of the challenges that they may be facing from inflation. Maybe they are not facing it today, but that's starting to build as they start to withdraw a little more deposits. So, it is more of a prospective thing than a current thing and we are all trying to find the right calibration of where things might land. And we don't want to undershoot that runway. I mean we want to be conservative. We want to be appropriate and think through all the risk that could exist in the portfolio. Great. Hi Betsy. Yes. Betsy, I think I would say it maybe a little bit differently. And I think Mike was trying to make this point. I mean we are sort of \u2013 if you look at sort of NII for the fourth quarter, and we are assuming that sort of stable through the year. So, that's the big driver. I mean if you think about what's the big bus and the revenue guidance, it's NII being stable. And that's not loan growth at the kind of revenue numbers. I mean the loan growth is going to pull back a little bit. Some of that's going to be intentional on our part. A lot of it's going to be return-oriented, just making sure that we have got really, really great relevance with our clients. And in some cases, the fee business is we expect to be up. We expect insurance to be up. We expect it to continue in its sort of high-single digit organic growth. We still have some inorganic momentum from some of the acquisitions we have gotten. We expect investment banking to actually return and increase its revenue growth. That will probably be a little more back-end weighted in fairness, but as we see where markets come out. But the big driver is sort of the NII fourth quarter where we are and that moving forward on a stabilized basis. That's the biggest driver. Yes. I will do it at a high level. I mean it will be \u2013 continue to be slightly down. So, I mean I think that's \u2013 that trend will continue. I think on a relative basis, we are showing deposit betas that are more reflective of our opportunity. And as the costs continue to grow, I mean deposit betas will increase. Mike, I don't know if you want to comment sort of specifically how we are thinking about that."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mike Maguire",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. I am going to begin on Slide 13. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income rose a very strong 7% to $4 billion, primarily due to ongoing margin expansion and strong loan growth. Deposit costs were well controlled and reflect the strength of our deposit franchise. Purchase accounting accretion decreased $19 million and is expected to continue to gradually diminish. Reported net interest margin increased 13 basis points and core net interest margin improved 15 basis points as a result of higher short-term interest rates alongside well-controlled deposit costs. Overall, we maintain a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, maintaining modest upside to higher short-term interest rates while having some downside protection when and if interest rates begin to decline. Looking to Slide 14, fee income rebounded during the quarter, increasing $125 million or 6% sequentially. The improvement was largely attributable to seasonality and insurance and the BenefitMall acquisition as well as higher investment banking and lending-related fee income. Insurance income increased $41 million, largely due to seasonality and a full quarter of BenefitMall results. Organic revenue for the full year grew 7% driven by a firm pricing environment, new business and strong retention. Investment banking and trading income increased $35 million as higher investment banking fees and strong core trading results in the quarter were partially offset by negative impacts from CVA/DVA. For the full year, investment banking income declined 37%, which we believe compares favorably to overall industry fee performance as the partnership between CIB and other lines of business continues to grow and earn momentum builds. Strategic hiring within CIB over the past 2 years has also led to improved lead table standards. Fee income declined 4% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by declines in market-sensitive businesses such as investment banking, wealth and mortgage and partially offset by organic and inorganic growth in insurance. Overdraft fees also declined from approximately $150 million in 4Q \u201821 to approximately $120 million in 4Q \u201822 as a result of the actions we took last year to eliminate a host of overdraft-related fees and the continued introduction of Truist One Banking to new existing clients. We expect overdraft fees to decline another 40% as we move from year end 2022 to year end 2024. While fee income remains below its potential, we are optimistic that our investments in key areas such as insurance, investment banking and wealth will payoff as markets normalize and our IRM execution continues to progress. Turning to Slide 15, reported non-interest expense increased $109 million or 3% sequentially. Merger and restructuring costs rose $18 million linked quarter and exceeded our October guide by $70 million due to higher-than-expected restructuring charges related to planned facility and branch reductions that will occur in 2023. These were business-as-usual decisions unrelated to the MOE and have solid financial returns. As Bill indicated, we will have no more restructuring charges or incremental operating expenses related to the MOE going forward. We would anticipate restructuring costs related to prior acquisition activity and other BAU expense normal rationalization efforts. It is difficult to forecast these with accuracy, but we would anticipate approximately $100 million to $125 million for 2023. Adjusted non-interest expense increased $68 million or 2% primarily due to the effects of our non-qualified plan. Excluding changes associated with the non-qualified plan, adjusted expense rose 0.6% sequentially, fairly consistent with our outlook from October. Personnel expense increased $84 million, half of which was from changes in the non-qualified plan and half of which was from the recent increase in our minimum wage. These increases were partially offset by a $35 million decrease in marketing expense and a $28 million reduction in other expense. The decline in other expense was driven by lower operational losses, which have decreased for two consecutive quarters, as recent investments in talent, technology, and process have begun to mitigate our fraud-related costs. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, adjusted non-interest expense grew by 8% as a result of the increase in minimum wage, investments in revenue-generating businesses, technology and acquisitions, higher call center staffing to support our clients post merger and a normalizing T&E spend. For the full year, adjusted expenses were $13.1 billion, up modestly from the $12.8 billion baseline in 2019. This performance is strong, reflecting the achievement of the $1.6 billion net cost save target. Overall, we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longer-term investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage. Below the line, our fourth quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of 16.7%, down from 18.2% in the third quarter, primarily due to annual true-ups for state income tax returns. Moving to Slide 16. Asset quality is strong, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio. Net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 34 basis points largely due to seasonality in indirect auto and lower recoveries. The allowance increased $172 million, reflecting strong loan growth and the ALLL ratio was stable at 1.34% as the effects of a moderately slower economic outlook were offset by high quality organic loan growth and the BankDirect acquisition. Excluding the BankDirect portfolio, which has extremely low losses through cycles, the ALLL ratio would have increased approximately 2 basis points. Continuing to Slide 17. Our CET1 ratio decreased from 9.1% to 9.0% as we deployed capital to support strong organic loan growth and close the BankDirect acquisition. We also continue to pay a strong dividend at $0.52 per share. Overall, our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile. We expect organic capital generation to improve in 2023 due to the elimination of MOE-related costs and more focused loan growth, all of which will provide additional flexibility and opportunities for Truist. Finally, our liquidity position remains strong with an average LCR of 112% and access to multiple funding sources. Our securities portfolio remains high quality at 97% government guaranteed and continues to produce approximately $3 billion of cash flow per quarter, which has supported our loan growth. Turning to Slide 18 where I'll provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. Looking into 1Q \u201823, we expect revenues to decline 2% to 3% relative to 4Q 2022, primarily driven by 2 fewer days impacting net interest income in addition to typical seasonal patterns in investment banking, card and payments and service charges, amongst other factors. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 1% to 2% as higher pension expense and FDIC premiums, along with seasonally higher personnel expenses are partially offset by ongoing cost discipline. For the full year 2023, we expect revenues to increase 7% to 9%, driven largely by strong net interest income growth and modestly improving fees. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 5% to 7% as a result of higher pension expense, higher FDIC premiums, the full annual impact of our minimum wage increase and acquisitions that closed throughout 2022. These four factors drive about 4% of our year-over-year increase. Given these factors, we are targeting adjusted operating leverage to be 200 basis points or greater, which would be more than 3x our pace in 2022. We also expect the net charge-off ratio to be between 35 and 50 basis points in 2023, given our expectations for continued normalization across the loan portfolio. Lastly, excluding discrete items, we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 19%, which translates to approximately 21% if you model it on a taxable equivalent basis. Now I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Ken, it's Mike. I'll take that one. I guess starting with the last question on the rate curve. Our outlook is that we will see two rate hikes in the first quarter, 25 a piece in February and March and see a policy rate stable until November, where we would expect a cut, which obviously, at the end of the year, probably doesn't have much of an impact on our NII perspective. Breaking revenue for the year into two components. From an NII perspective, the way I'd think about it is we obviously had really strong growth in 2022. The second half, in particular, also had very nice margin expansion. So we have a really nice exit velocity from an NII perspective. We believe we have a little bit of asset sensitivity left. So we do have the opportunity to realize some of the upside of the hikes in the first quarter and we will have, as Bill mentioned, slowing loan growth. But those two factors combined, we think, give us a stable outlook for Q1 NII. And then for the rest of the year, that we believe we will stay relatively stable, some pressure on the NIMs offset by some modest amount of loan growth. On a year-over-year basis, just given the average loan growth that we would expect that will be, we think, a very nice growth. And frankly, we will drive the majority of the growth potential in the revenue guide. From a fee perspective, I think a couple of puts and a few takes. We expect to continue to have good performance from the insurance business, which is growing nicely on an organic basis as well as realizing the full benefit of the acquisitions that we completed in 2022. Our investment banking business, we believe, has some potential to benefit from improvements in market conditions, probably more likely in the second half than the first half. And then I think we will have a little bit of pressure. We would expect there to be pressure on the on the residential mortgage business as well as the service charges and overdraft fees on deposits. Yes, Ken. I'll take that one again. Look, I've been very pleased by how the betas have performed so far. They have outperformed our expectations on a pretty consistent basis. We obviously are seeing some acceleration of rate pursuing behaviors and seeing pressures on balances as well, uncharted territory in many respects. We think we will get through the last cycle, perhaps even high 30s, approaching and even hitting 40% by the time we're to the last hike. Sure. In \u201823, I believe the annualized M&A impact is $127-or-so million. So, that's about 1% of that growth. You recall in the guide, we talked about these four components that were \u2013 where we have quite a bit of visibility into and frankly, not much flexibility, and that's the pension, the M&A impact, the annualized impact of minimum wage and the FDIC expense. And those components in the aggregate are about 4%. Hope that helps. Yes. I think it's been moving more relevant on capabilities, more relevant on size. You are seeing it in the results, whether it would be the ability to manage expenses. Yes, exactly right. Yes. Sure, Gerard. As we look into \u201823, I think a couple of factors. One, we \u2013 obviously, 2022 was a year where we had outsized, particularly in the second half, loan growth and net interest margin expansion, which obviously was a great tailwind on the revenue side. As we look into \u201823, we expect to continue to have nice growth from a year-over-year perspective, but we are expecting that NII trend to really stabilize. And frankly, we are going to begin to experience some pressure on the NIM side probably in the second quarter. From an expense perspective, we also mentioned, there are a few just structural expenses that are in the plan for \u201823 that when combined, add up to about 4% year-over-year change. We obviously intend to make investments beyond those four categories in our clients and our teammates and in other strategic investment priorities. But that structural expense growth is there. So, again, we feel good about that sort of 2% with upside operating leverage guide and feel good about our \u2013 frankly, our revenue guide as well. So, hopefully, that's helpful to you. Yes. We mentioned in an earlier question that we see betas increasing. Whether they reach the 40% level or not, we will see. I would say the other trend, Betsy, which is consistent with what others are expecting and what's consistent with our expectation is we are still seeing a remixing from DDA and interest-bearing so that makes sense. And we are still well above where we were sort of pre-stimulus. We were in the high-20s, 28%, 29%. We peaked during the sort of height of stimulus in the 35.5%, 36%. We are back at like 34% right now and going to 33% and probably approaching 30% over time. And I think, Bill, you hit it right. I mean I think we are seeing some deposit balance pressure in the aggregate and we would expect that to continue in 2023, perhaps moderate a bit. That's great."

            "content": "John, this is Clarke. I will take that one. As you saw, we had 34 basis points in losses in Q4. That reflected primarily seasonality \u2013 normal seasonality in our consumer segments and a little bit of normalization. And as Mike mentioned, we had lower recoveries in our wholesale areas. So, that's what the delta was from Q3 to Q4. And then what we are seeing is the consumer segments are normalizing. And also just to remind you all that the whole industry has had anemic wholesale and CRE losses over the last couple of years. So, we are pretty similar to that. So therefore, we would expect losses to return towards the lower range of our long-term loss range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points as we go through \u201823, and it just depends upon how the economy performs. And that's why you see that reflected in our guidance of 35 bps to 50 bps. Well, I would just say, to your point, Bill, clients' balance sheets, their liquidity, their financial positions are very good going into this. Obviously, depending on what happens in the economy, the impact of the higher rates, input costs, all of these things, we are monitoring very closely with our clients. Gerard, we are looking at things like CRE and the term risk and things like office. So, I think we are just looking out what could be some of those impacts from the \u2013 if the economy does slow and obviously, that's reflected in everyone's provisioning models. But to your point, the actual performance to-date and the near-term outlook is still strong."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations with Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead.\nAnkur Vyas: Thank you, Jake, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's third quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third quarter results and share their perspectives on our efforts to transition from an integration focus to an operating focus, current business conditions and our continued activation of Truist's purpose. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call. The accompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information, are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. In addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter reflected strong progress in many areas overall. However, financial performance was mixed, reflecting continued challenging market conditions. Strong spread income resulted from significant margin expansion that exceeded our guidance and strong broad-based loan growth. Credit quality remains excellent. At the same time, capital markets revenue did not rebound as anticipated, and in fact, declined link quarter. Strategically, we continue to realize the benefits of shifting from integrating to operating, which I'll share more on later. I acknowledge that operating losses continue to be too high. However, other expense growth reflects targeted investments in talented technology in key areas of long-term sustainable growth. Merger calls diminished again, and our remaining decommissioning activities are mostly complete and be finalized by year-end. We'll share details on each of these themes throughout the call. And turning to our purpose on Slide 4, Truist is a purpose-driven company that's dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities. This commitment to purpose and our value of care could not have been more apparent in how our teammates responded to each other and their clients and the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. I experienced this firsthand when I visited with our teams in Southwest Florida soon after the storm subsided. Clients expressed their significant appreciation that we opened our branches to care for them during this time loss. The many truckloads of food, water supplies and other critical items that we sent to the region made a real difference. And the $1.25 million donation from the Truist Foundation will continue to provide support to affected areas in Florida. Have begun, and Truist is committed to supporting these communities in the short term, but also helping them be more resilient in the long term. And this is one of the many ways we're living our purpose, as you can see on Slide 5. In order to inspire, it's often necessary to be bold and to be first, and that's exactly what we did on October 1. We made a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 per hour. The new minimum wage benefits approximately 14,000 teammates, about 80% of whom are in client-facing roles. We strongly believe this action will drive purposeful growth and offset the estimated $200 million increase in annual personnel expense through improved teammate recruitment and retention, lower turnover expense, better execution and an all-around better client experience. In fact, we're already starting to see the benefits of the higher minimum wage. Teller turnover in August and September was down about 25% compared to the first seven months of the year. Our branch vacancy rates have been cut in half since July. We also advanced our commitment to inspire with the launch of Truist One Banking in July. Truist One is our differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking, including two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. The flagship Truist One checking account has zero overdraft fees and the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple $100 negative balance buffer. We also introduced the Truist Confidence Account, which provides consumers access to mainstream banking services and no overdraft fees. These accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and have been embraced by new and existing clients. Since their launch, overall branch deposit production has increased 13% in August and September compared to the prior year despite having 16% fewer branches. We're also in the process of rolling out our cash reserve deposit base credit line up to $750. We began a pilot earlier this month and expect the cash reserve feature to be available across our footprint later this quarter. Now turning to Slide 7. Merger costs totaled $152 million, down 30% sequentially and 58% year-over-year as our integration activities wind down. The final merger costs expected in the fourth quarter are primarily related to our decommissioning efforts, which, as I mentioned, will conclude by year-end. The completion of merger activities is a monumental move forward that will reflect a seamless client experience, simplify our narrative, enhance our earnings quality, improve capital and help us realize industry-leading returns. Turning to our third quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.15 per share on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.7 billion or $1.24 per share, up 3% sequentially as 5% adjusted PPNR growth was partially offset by higher provision as a result of our higher consumer net charge-offs. Net interest income grew 10% to a post-merger high, benefiting from higher short-term rates and well-controlled deposit costs, all of which drove significant margin expansion as well as strong broad-based loan growth. Despite solid forward progress, the pace of PPNR growth was weaker than we had anticipated, primarily due to ongoing pressure in investment banking, as well as unfavorable valuation marks taken at quarter end. Adjusted expenses increased 2.6% link quarter mostly as expected; however, operational losses remain elevated. While we made a purposeful decision to proactively refund our clients for fraud losses, our overall goal is to reduce them significantly to improve our results and the client experience. This is an industry-wide phenomenon. Part of our technology spend is directly related to this effort. These investments include efforts to enhance identity authentication and fraud detection, among others. Adjusted operating leverage was a strong 260 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting strong net interest income growth, combined with modest expense growth. This momentum has helped us close the gap towards our goal of positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Asset quality remains excellent, notwithstanding normalizing trends and a seasonal uptick and net charge-offs within our consumer portfolios. We deployed 10 basis points of capital to support strong loan growth and complete the Benefitmall acquisition, which expands our capabilities and fills a strategic gap in our wholesale insurance business. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile, and we're confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios. Now turning to Slide 9. Digital activity continues to increase from the first quarter levels, reflecting strong momentum post-integration. This progress reflects our significantly improved agility and responsiveness from being on one digital platform. Year-to-date, we've delivered 3x more production releases across business, retail and wealth than in all of 2021. Client satisfaction with their digital experience has also improved rapidly each quarter. Consistent with our pivot from integrating to operating, our technology and digital teams are allocating more of their time, energy and resources to transformation and innovation. To that end, we recently launched Truist Assist to our retail and wealth clients through our mobile and online banking platforms. Truist Assist is our AI-enhanced virtual assistant that leverages natural language processing and natural language understanding to interact and respond to client questions. Through September 30, Truist Assist had been deployed to our personal banking clients and had been utilized by 114,000 unique clients to handle 147,000 interactions that otherwise might have occurred in a branch or contact center. We're also expanding LightStream, both by enhancing the sophistication of its underwriting models through artificial intelligence, and by piloting a new savings product to broaden its capability set. In addition, the recent acquisition of the Arena platform from software start-up Zaloni will help accelerate our data journey through the development of a stronger integrated data infrastructure solution deployed in a hybrid cloud environment. As a result, our data quality, analytics and speed to market will all significantly improve. Overall, I'm highly optimistic about the potential of our increased investments and capabilities to enhance performance and client experience. Turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Loan growth was strong and broad-based for the second consecutive quarter. Average balances grew $13 billion or 4.3% sequentially in part due to our shift from integrating to operating. C&I remains strong as average balances grew $7 billion or 4.5%. C&I loans grew across most CIB industry verticals and product groups, reflecting higher revolver utilization, the current shift to banks from the bond market and our increased competitiveness for new and existing clients. Revolver utilization increased just over 100 basis points to approximately 31%, the highest level since the second quarter of 2020. In our commercial community bank, C&I balances, excluding PPP and dealer floor plan increased 1.3%, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. We achieved growth across almost all of our CCB regions. Residential mortgage balances increased $4 billion or 8.2%, reflecting previous correspondent mortgage production and slower prepayment speeds. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances increased 3.1%, a strong growth in Prime Auto, Service Finance, LightStream, recreational lending and Sheffield, more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios. Production in our consumer finance business is up 20% year-over-year, reflecting good business development momentum with Service Finance, abating inventory shortages within Sheffield and RAC and improved automated decisioning capabilities across the board, which ultimately improves consistency, efficiency and creates better client experiences. Near term, our loan growth outlook remains healthy as our pipelines are relatively strong and teammates continue to shift their capacity from integrating to operating and take advantage of new tools in their toolkit. Over the medium term, loan growth may moderate as clients absorb and digest the impact of higher rates, higher inflation and slowing growth. We also expect growth in residential mortgage and Prime Auto to slow going forward as we shift our capital towards higher return opportunities. Truist continues to remain well-positioned to advise clients across a broad range of economic scenarios, given our capabilities, talented teammates and increased capacity post integration. Now turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposits decreased $3.7 billion or just under 1% in the third quarter driven by tightening monetary policy, reduced savings in response to higher inflation and seasonal patterns. Deposit costs were very well-controlled, reflecting Truist's strong retail and commercial franchise and our enviable market share position. In addition, our lines of business and corporate treasury teams continued to deliver excellent execution against a thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. As a result, interest-bearing cumulative deposit betas have been 21% thus far, well below our modeled assumptions. As the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid, particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding. Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to acknowledge and thank Daryl Bible. He has built a best-in-class finance function. He played a key essential role in the success of our merger, and he's really been incredibly supportive in helping Mike transition into the CFO role. Many of you in the investment community know Daryl well, and appreciate his knowledge and transparency, which will continue to be hallmarks of Truist going forward. I'm also excited to introduce Mike Maguire as our new CFO. Most recently, Mike led Truist Consumer Finance and Payments businesses including LightStream, Service Finance, Sheffield and Auto Finance. He was also responsible for our Enterprise Payment Strategy Group and Wholesale Payments businesses, including Treasury Solutions, Merchant Services and Commercial Card. Mike is a strategic thinker, a purpose-driven leader with an exceptional depth of experience across our enterprise and a deep understanding of how technology is shaping our operating environment. He's truly an industry thought leader in the fintech space. We'll certainly draw on this experience as Mike assumes his new role during this time of exciting transformation. So Mike, with that, I'm going to turn it over to you.\nMike Maguire: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would also like to thank Daryl for his guidance and his support throughout my transition into the CFO role. I'm excited about the opportunity, and I'm confident that the transition will be seamless for all of our stakeholders. I also want to thank my teammates in the finance organization for welcoming me and for their support. We have a really talented team, and I look forward to working with all of them. For our analysts and investors, I'll be on the road soon, and hope to meet as many of you as possible. This is really a great opportunity, and I'm excited about helping take Truist to new heights. So moving to Slide 12, for the quarter, net interest income increased 10% sequentially to $3.8 billion as higher short-term interest rates and strong loan growth more than offset lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest income was up a strong 14%. Deposit costs remain well-controlled, reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise. Lower purchase accounting accretion was the result of elevated accretion in previous periods due to conversion activity and slowing prepays in the current period. Reported net interest margin increased 23 basis points, while core net interest margin increased 30 basis points, driven by similar trends as net interest income. Moving to Slide 13, fee income decreased $146 million or 6.5% sequentially. Insurance income decreased $100 million primarily due to seasonally lower property and casualty commissions. Investment banking and trading income decreased $33 million as lower fees from structured real estate, investment grade and high-yield bonds and syndicated and leveraged finance were partially offset by increased M&A fees. Wider credit spreads, tightening liquidity and general macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty are all contributing to slower activity levels. Despite these current headwinds, we continue to make strong strategic progress within Corporate and Investment Banking. Capital Markets revenue from non-corporate and investment banking clients is up 25% year-over-year as our commercial community bank, commercial real estate and wealth teammates continue to learn how to successfully partner with CIB to deliver strategic advice to our clients. Our lead table position has improved across most products, including equity capital markets, high yield, investment grade and syndicated and leveraged finance. Given the strategic progress, we intend to continue to take advantage of the challenging environment to invest in Truist Securities by selectively adding talent to drive long-term share gains as we've successfully done during previous market disruptions. Other income, excluding impacts from our non-qualified plan, decreased $17 million link quarter, primarily due to valuation-related marks. Compared to a year ago, other income decreased $81 million as a result of lower investment income and valuation marks on SBIC-related and other strategic investments. Turning to Slide 14, adjusted non-interest expense increased $83 million or 2.6% sequentially, reflecting forward-focused investments in talent and technology, as well as elevated operational losses. Professional fees and outside processing expense increased $34 million on an adjusted basis as we advanced critical projects, including investments in cybersecurity, contact center modernization, fraud detection and the build-out of our in-house payments capabilities. Other expense increased $28 million, primarily due to higher operational losses. Personnel expense increased $23 million on an adjusted basis, reflecting strategic and purposeful additions in technology, commercial community banking, CIB, consumer finance and wealth, as well as the BenefitMall acquisition. Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest expense only increased 2%. This modest increase was driven by higher operational losses and investment spend, which were partially offset by merger-related cost savings in software and net occupancy expense. Overall, we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longer-term investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage. As an example, we believe recent technology investments to enhance identity authentication, fraud detection, among other factors, will mitigate operational losses. Also, with the conversion behind us, we have additional flexibility to rationalize certain businesses such as mortgage, where capacity exceeds demand. Lastly, we have our final leg of data center-related technology savings that is expected to materialize throughout the fourth quarter. Below the line, our third quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of 18.2% down from 19.5% in the second quarter primarily due to discrete tax benefits arising from final true-ups to our 2021 tax return. We continue to expect a normal effective tax rate to be 20% which translates to 21% on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Moving to Slide 15, asset quality continues to be excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio. Leading credit indicators remain strong. Non-performing loans decreased 1 basis point and loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 7 basis points. Net charge-offs remained benign at 27 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily due to normalizing trends and seasonality in certain consumer portfolios. Our total allowance increased $18 million to support our loan growth and the ALLL ratio decreased 4 basis points due to strong portfolio performance and growth in higher-quality loans, partially offset by a moderately slower economic outlook. Moving on to Slide 16, our CET1 ratio decreased from 9.2% to 9.1% as we deployed capital to support strong loan growth and to complete the BenefitMall acquisition. We also increased the dividend 8% to $0.52 per share beginning in the third quarter, reflecting our confidence in our improving earnings trajectory. Overall, our capital position remains strong in light of our risk and profitability profile, and we maintain a strong liquidity position with access to multiple sources of funding for incremental loan growth. Turning now to Slide 17, I'll next outline the strategic rationale and financial impact of two recently announced insurance acquisitions. First, BenefitMall closed on September 1, providing a scaled entry into wholesale employee benefits and filling one of the remaining strategic gaps in our capability set. BenefitMall is expected to add $160 million of annual revenue at an initial EBITDA margin in the mid-20% that will build to the mid-30% over time as synergies are realized. The transaction also has potential earn benefits within Truist Insurance by supporting our brokers at McGriff, our retail insurance business and also outside Truist Insurance with our corporate and commercial clients. We also recently announced the acquisition of BankDirect Capital Finance. Strategically, BankDirect effectively doubles our premium finance business, broadens our capabilities to include life insurance and expands our West Coast presence. Pro forma, we estimate Truist Insurance Holdings will be the number two premium finance player in the market after this deal closes later this quarter. BankDirect brings with it a $3.2 billion loan portfolio with strong projected growth, attractive profitability, limited credit risk and short duration. While both acquisitions are expected to be dilutive initially, we believe they are strategic and financially attractive over the long run. So, I'll now provide new guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid double-digit basis point increase in both our core and reported net interest margin due to benefits from the recent rate hikes and a projected 75 basis point hike in November. Fees will rebound sequentially, driven by insurance income improving due to seasonality, solid organic growth and the full impact of the BenefitMall acquisition. The extent to which investment banking fees improve will be dictated by levels of capital markets activity. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase approximately 1% as the increase to minimum wage, investments and revenue-producing businesses and technology and acquisitions are partially offset by the impacts of cost savings. Putting these pieces all together, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow approximately 10% with some upside based on the realization of investment banking pipelines. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter expectations, we are on track to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year. We remain consistent with our expectations that the net charge-off ratio will be between 25 and 35 basis points for the full year due to our performance year-to-date and normalizing trends across our loan portfolio. With that, I will turn it back to Bill to conclude.\nBill Rogers: Great. Thank you, Mike. Continuing to our strategic shift on Slide 18. Earlier this year, I expressed my view that the first quarter was a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Our third quarter results build upon the second quarter progress even as market conditions diminished overall PPNR trajectory, progress is real and it's palpable. We've made significant progress in our digital and technology areas as evidenced by improving mobile app ratings and enhanced client experience within treasury and payments and many other new features and capabilities that strengthen the financial confidence of our clients. Speed to answer in our care centers is now well below our initial service level agreements and more investment will improve the efficiency as well. Loan production in the third quarter was highest it's been at Truist, up 8% compared to the second quarter. Branch loan and deposit production are up a solid 14% and 20% like quarter, respectively, as teammates become more confident with processes and systems, but also improve solutions and capabilities. IRM referrals to our wealth businesses increased 17% sequentially and the amount of income generated from IRM referrals by our commercial community bank was the second highest ever both highlighting the power of our advice-driven and client-centric model. Our brand awareness was up almost 400 basis points in the third quarter while our peers were flat to down. And our brand consideration which measures whether consumers are giving Truist a serious thought was 210 basis points and ranks us fifth highest in our markets, having only been alive for that brand for three years. Almost all of our client satisfaction scores are ascending and in many cases, at their highest levels since we become Truist. The financial benefits of this momentum are being realized and will be increasingly visible as market conditions normalize and merger-related expense noise abates. To conclude, Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis on Slide 19. Strategically, we have shifted from execution to execution, transformation and growth. We're investing in digital and technology as we reduce cost, including operational losses. We're simplifying our processes and operations, and we're acting on our purpose each and every day with a singular goal of improving our client experience. We're also intensely focused on capturing the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as it's squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients. These shifts in activities do not require incremental risk appetite or capital, just execution and focus, both of which lie within our sphere of control. Externally, while we believe the economy is generally healthy, persistent high inflation and a rapid tightening of monetary policy, combined with geopolitical tensions, have reduced visibility and increased uncertainty as we move into 2023. Truist is nevertheless well-positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice-oriented model for clients, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, and our strong capital position relative to our risk profile and our significant performance momentum as we continue the shift from integration to execution and growth. Ankur, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.\nAnkur Vyas: Thanks, Bill. Jake, at this time, if you don't mind, will you please explain how our listeners can will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will begin with Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Bill, you mentioned that you guys had positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis of 260 basis points. Can you give us some color what you're thinking about -- and when you look at adjusted positive operating leverage for the next 12 months, what do you think that could come in at?\nBill Rogers: Yes. I think well obviously for the balance of the year, we talked about this as well, but I think we'll have positive operating leverage for the year. As we look into 2023, obviously, there are a lot of puts and takes. There's a lot of uncertainty headed into that. But positive operating leverage is going to be a core tenet of what we do. So if we look at the revenue potential in terms of the loan growth and deposit production we've had, being able to capitalize on those opportunities with those clients as we move forward, so even if the economy slows down a bit, we still have a lot of momentum in that area. We've got great strength in our insurance business. We've got great strength in our overall capital markets business. Wealth has been building its capability. So, we've got a lot of engines and tailwind from that side. And then, we've got a lot of tailwind on the cost sides. So, we'll complete the bulk of the merger cost saves at the end of this year. But heading into next year is really where we get to leverage all those. If you think about the concept of you put two things together, now you make those two things more efficient. So those opportunities for digitization and automation, we're consolidating our card platform. All the things that will continue on in terms of cost saves. So, I'm just -- I am not giving you specific guidance on operating leverage for the year other than to say that will be a core tenet and component of how we plan for the future.\nGerard Cassidy: And then as a follow-up question, you pointed out that the deposit beta was 21% on a cumulative basis and then 14% without the brokered CDs. And that was below your models. Two things, can you tell us what your model would have suggested the deposit beta would have been? And then second, using the forward curve, where do you think you end up with a final cumulative deposit beta?\nMike Maguire: This is Mike, I'm happy to take that one. So, you're right, we've been very pleased by the performance of the deposit portfolio so far at 21%. I think we said earlier this year, we expected betas to be closer to 30% as we get to the second half of the year. We still expect that to be the case by year-end. In terms of a terminal beta, very, very hard to tell, we've seen probably some lag given the rate at which rates have increased. And so, we do expect there to be some catch-up, but whether or not it will be to the tune of the previous cycle in the mid-30s or beyond, we'll observe that together.\nOperator: We'll move to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Just want to ask a question on funding and deposits. You guys are showing fairly good resiliency as is the industry. Just give a little more context of what you're expecting to see in terms of mix shift and also your thoughts. It looked like you did add a bunch of wholesale borrowings relative to your incremental cost of funding through deposits. So just think -- help us think about how you're thinking about liability structure and deposit growth.\nMike Maguire: Ken, it's Mike, I'll start here as well. So again, we have been very pleased from the deposit perspective with only a sequential decrease of 1%. And so very pleased by how the balances are hanging in there. We are expecting, I think, over the near term, to continue to have some pressure on deposits, as well as some pressure on mix. We did see some shift from DDA into interest-bearing. That's been a moderate shift so far, and we're still well above levels that we experienced pre-COVID. But we are beginning to see that shift take place. In terms of short-term borrowings, you're right, we are accessing brokered markets. We are accessing short-term markets and do expect that to continue over the intermediate term. But don't expect that to shift significantly. As we think about funding, loan growth for one has been very, very high. So far year-to-date, we do expect loan growth to moderate somewhat, which should alleviate some of that gap. But between the deposit balance levels, between leveraging some of the securities portfolio running off to the tune of $10 billion to $15 billion per year, accessing some of the wholesale markets, which is a pretty wide array of tools and even thinking about the capital markets, we feel really good about our funding capability.\nBill Rogers: And Ken, maybe just to add to that in terms of the first part of the question, too, is just the strength of our deposit franchise. It's pretty granular, 42% under $250,000. We've got really good market share. But what we're seeing, I talked about this in my prepared comments, our production's really strong. Truist One has been really successful. Our teammates have really responded, clients and both new clients and existing clients have really responded, investments in treasury and payments. So, we're leaning into this in terms of our own capabilities from the deposit production side. And then for the fourth quarter, remember, the third quarter has got some seasonality in things like public funds, for example, where that's a strong area for us. So, I think we'll be sort of stable in the fourth quarter. And then Mike talked, I think, eloquently about the funding side.\nKen Usdin: And just one quick follow-up, just can you just give us a sense of where you're reinvesting the cash flows that are going back into the securities portfolio versus what's rolling off?\nMike Maguire: Yes, I mean the cash flow that's coming off is being invested in the loan portfolio. There's de minimis investing to support our CRA efforts, but the bulk of the cash flow is being invested in loans.\nBill Rogers: The great news is we have something to deploy it towards, which is perfect.\nMike Maguire: Yes.\nOperator: Moving on to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Bill, you saw -- I saw a nice sequential growth and it's likely to continue to grow into 4Q given your outlook plus the asset balance -- as a sense of balance sheet. So I guess, based on your comments on to Gerard of betas in the mid-30s or maybe a little bit higher, do you think you can continue to grow NII as a -- on a sequential basis as we look ahead over the next few quarters, adjusted for seasonal impacts? And maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes involved in that.\nBill Rogers: Michael, I'll let you start, and I'll talk about that as well.\nMike Maguire: Yes, Ryan, you're right. I mean, look, we've got a really good trajectory going into Q4 with the NIM, as we mentioned in our guide, expected to increase 15 or so basis points. Look, as long as rates continue to increase, we expect to continue to see some NIM expansion. At some point, I think we all expect to achieve this terminal policy rate and whether it's higher longer or begins to decline, we'll see. From an NII perspective, we'll obviously benefit from that NIM expansion over that period. And then I think as NIMs begin to feel some pressure, we feel good again today. We've got really nice earning asset growth. We expect that to moderate, but should offset any impact over the intermediate term of the decline in NIM. We see '23 from a rates perspective as a relatively stable period.\nBill Rogers: To Mike's point, a lot of it also depend on loan growth and what we see going into next year, really positive momentum through this quarter, which I think will continue into the fourth quarter. It all for -- it's a little murkier as we head into next year, but I like the momentum and the production and the pipelines and the relevance and the competitiveness of our franchise right now from that standpoint.\nRyan Nash: Bill, maybe a bigger picture question for me. So, I think at a recent conference, you highlighted that you expected expenses to grow in '23, which makes sense given you've done a handful of deals as pressure from inflation. However, when we think back on the drivers of the merger, we were talking about best-in-class growth, improving returns. And I know we've now made the shift to offense. But when I speak to investors, I get the sense I feel we're not quite there yet. So while I know you're not giving '23 guidance. What do we need to see for this to begin to come through, whether it's operating leverage or better-than-peer expense growth? And just how are you measuring the success of all these efforts?\nBill Rogers: Yes, I think overall, I mean, we've talked about this. It's the measurement of can we grow revenue long term over time and PPNR faster and relative to our market opportunities. And I think that opportunity sits squarely in front of us. I think if I look at the things that contribute to that in the areas of production, like loan production, AUM production, deposit production, I'd argue, actually, we're sort of getting to sort of a peak kind of performance in those areas. As it relates to the expense side, and this stuff just doesn't go quarter-to-quarter. You just -- they're going to have different levels of investment. We've made a conscious decision. And while I'll acknowledge, I'm cranky on the operating losses side. So operational losses, I think we've got some opportunity there. I see some improvements coming, but that has been longer and taken longer than I had anticipated, but we're consciously investing in some areas. So we're consciously investing in investment banking and wealth and insurance. And you know us well. I mean we've got a good track record here. When times are a little bumpy and the opportunity is there, we've taken advantage of it, and that's proven to be really, really smart investments on our standpoint. So, we're sort of unabashed about that, and that has a quarter-to-quarter implication to it. And I just have to absorb it and take it because I'm confident that we're doing the things that will create better opportunity for us and allow us to gain share over time. So long answer to a short direct question, I think we can grow disproportionately over time. It just won't look like that quarter-to-quarter. And I think look at the production, look at the capabilities that we're creating today, and I'm confident in manifesting those towards the future.\nOperator: And Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley has the next question.\nBetsy Graseck: It's Betsy. I wanted to just dig into a couple of things, one is on loan growth. It's been really strong. And I heard the comments around how you're funding it and how you're thinking about driving that from here. I wanted to get a little bit of an understanding on how you're thinking about the quality of the book relative to its ability to absorb this interest rate hike. So obviously, we've had about 300 basis points so far. We're going to get at least another 150-plus over the next quarter or so. And how are you assessing your borrower's ability to pay you back? Are we all too worried about credit risk? I know you gave the guide for the full year NCOs, which I'm wondering why not having -- have brought that down given the performance you've had to date. So just a few questions on credit from that perspective.\nBill Rogers: Yes, I'll start, Betsy, if it can also turn it over to Clarke, he's itching to get in and talk about credit quality and the quality of the portfolio and what we put on the books. We've not diminished our commitment to credit quality. We're taking our clients through the appropriate stress testing process. I mean we're underwriting at new rates and new environments. So, I think our production just reflects our just competitiveness. I mean our ability to win more size and relevance with our clients. And then you see that reflected right now in our reserve, particularly on the wholesale side. The quality actually is -- might argue might be improving. So Clarke, why don't you embellish that, if you would?\nClarke Starnes: Yes, thanks, Bill, and I agree with you. We're very careful in our underwriting right now. So we're looking obviously at rate shock and the ability to absorb that. We're looking at other things like pricing power and their margins, given supply and input costs and inflation, looking at clients' investment decisions, how they're deploying capital, their liquidity, their balance sheet and just overall strength. So, we feel really good about the core underwriting. In fact, I would tell you for the quarter, about 95% of our C&I production was investment grade or near investment grade credit, so really high quality there. And as far as our NCO guidance for the full year, we feel really good about where we are. But remember, we normalize as we go into the fourth quarter from a consumer standpoint and we have the seasonal impact. So that's really truly the consumer side that may increase losses on.\nBetsy Graseck: And then just digging in a little bit on the commercial side on this theme, can you remind us how you are thinking about your Shared National Credit exposure, what that is, leverage lending? I know legacy SunTrust had a bigger skew in their business model to that, but with the combined organization, it's been reduced a bit as a percentage of total. So just give us a sense as to how big those books are today, how they're trending, and how much capacity you have to lean in with the bigger balance with the bigger balance with the bigger balance with the bigger balance sheet you've got now.\nBill Rogers: Yes, Clarke, why don't you take that?\nClarke Starnes: Yes, maybe I'll start it, Bill. First, from an SNC standpoint, we're in really good shape. We just went through the exam and had great results. I feel very good about that. We have about $59 billion in outstandings in our SNC book. So it's about 19% of our balances, and that's been fairly steady or so. So, it's a very diversified book. We feel really good about that. As far as our leveraged finance book, just remember, that's about 7% of our total book; however, over half of that is 55% investment-grade clients. So really 3% would be more in the sponsored or non-investment grade side. That book's performing extremely well today. So minimal NPLs, we've had about 9 basis points of losses and are criticized are in good shape. So while there's been disruption and challenges in the market, our overall performance has been very, very good.\nBill Rogers: I think you characterized it right that as part of the benefits of the merger is the diversification of that portfolio by definition of the denominator. So, we haven't grown it in proportion to the increase in the size of our business, and it's well-diversified. Leverage portfolio is well diversified. Exposures are not significant to any one person. And it's about 50% sponsors and about 50% on us. So this is a business that supports our client base, and it's categorized as leverage, but it's really supporting the growth in our client base and consistent with our strategy of helping our clients with their business life cycles. I mean I think -- so it's a little bit different and a little more focused on an on-us component.\nOperator: Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo will have our next question.\nMike Mayo: I'll continue my analogy with your franchise as a core. I mean, you're clearly in the country's sweet spot for population growth. I mean I keep meeting more of investing clients that have moved to New York to Florida permanently, entire firms. And -- so you're certainly in the sweet spot. You did mention momentum and certainly NII and loan growth and how you're going from defense to offense. So I get it. But then I hear, Bill, your target for positive operating leverage of over 0%. It just seems like with a target like that, you're aiming for the Charlotte Motor Speedway instead of Indianapolis 500, right? It seems like -- and this is at a time when your peers are showing much greater positive operating leverage and they don't have this unique in-market merger with these incredible synergies that are possible. So I know you're not giving too much guidance for next year right now, but can you just talk about whatever headwinds may be going away? You talk about the operational losses. It seems like you're doing a lot for your customers. You're making them whole more than others perhaps. You're doing a lot for your employees. You're raising what they get paid, but I'm just thinking about the shareholders here. And so what are some of the headwinds that may or may not go away? And what are some of the tailwinds that you think we'll see more of?\nBill Rogers: Yes, thanks, Mike. And we'll continue to keep the corvette network going, I guess. But if we define speed as related to how are you doing against your markets, I look at the loan deposit AUM, the production side. And I'd say we're actually at a really good high rate of speed. And I'd say we're at our speed that reflects the opportunity that sits in our market. So if we define it that way, if we define the opportunity, which I 100% agree with is to have improved positive operating leverage overtime and increased revenue and PPNR growth. We also have to invest to make that happen. So we like you to see the same things that you're seeing in our markets, and we've got to make sure that we invest in those. And again, I wish it sort of balanced out quarter-to-quarter. It just doesn't. So the opportunities for us to invest right now, and I think gain share long term in areas I mentioned before, like investment banking, like insurance, like wealth, we're just going to do that. And I think that's going to have a good long-term impact for us. You've seen this before, you've seen this movie and you know how well it ends for us. So we know how to do this. So I'm very confident on that side. And then the part about the operational losses and the commitments that we made to our clients, those are also good long-term decisions. I mean, look, we were in the middle of a merger. We gave the benefit of the doubt to a client. Whenever there was a benefit of a doubt, I think long term, that's going to create sustainable long-term relationships and the same thing with teammates. Increasing minimum wage is fantastic for shareholders. I cited some of the stats that we're seeing already an improved turnover and improved vacancy rates. I didn't mention the care center. We're seeing that as well. So long term, that's going to have a tremendous benefit for our shareholders, as well as our teammates. So I'm confident. I think we're materializing the things that we want to have. It's just not coming in quarter-to-quarter as I'd like. It's not as matched as I'd like. There are some pesky things that I think will come down, and I'm already seeing that at the end of the quarter and the first of this quarter in terms of operational losses. So, we can have a cleaner more focused, easier to understand and easier to have the production and those things result in the kind of PPNR growth that I think we're able to do long term.\nMike Mayo: So a follow-up, even if I can see the speed part, I guess, the cost of gas is quite high, and maybe, Mike, from your perspective, coming into the CFO spot, things that you might be able to do to control the expenses, as Bill was alluding to.\nMike Maguire: Yes, Mike, good morning and happy to react to that. I mean, I think, first and foremost, still, at this point, absorbing and coming in and meeting the team, getting a sense for where we are. Look, Bill made some great points. I don't come to the table with some predefined view or silver bullet as it relates to these things. The headwinds that Bill talked about, minimum wage, inflation, some of the investments that we're prioritizing, they're important. But then again, we have some great tailwinds as well, whether it'd be realizing the benefits of the savings. I think there's some benefit from an automation perspective, some work we're doing that's in more nascent phase, and then just overall productivity. I mean, look, if we -- I think we've got a great track record in terms of being able to manage expense. If and when that becomes a more important priority based on market conditions, but no, I think Bill said it well, Mike.\nOperator: Now, we'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess one follow-up first for Clarke on the reserves, and Clarke, apologies if I missed it, but can you remind us what's the base case of the weighted unemployment rate that's baked into your reserving at the end of the quarter? And I guess, as we think about sort of what the next 12 months could look like, what are the other one or two big inputs that could change the reserving outlook other than unemployment?\nClarke Starnes: That's a great question. In our base case, which we wait at 40%, we have unemployment going up to 4% and then going higher into the mid-4s as we go into '23 and beyond. So clearly, a little more pessimistic on as we ran the reserves this quarter. I would say for us, other big drivers would be a housing HPI would be another input there in our models, and you've already mentioned GDP. So from our standpoint, the big driver for us would be the scenario weighting and the scenario outlook would have the biggest impact on our reserves, obviously, versus other things like our mix of production and our overall portfolio performance. But right now, I think the scenario outlook would be the biggest driver.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And I guess just one follow-up, Bill, for you. As we look at the next stage, I mean, obviously, BB&T, SunTrust history of acquisitions, a lot of your peers might be struggling in terms of deposit, deposit pricing, given what the fed might be doing. Talk to us in terms of as we look forward to the next year or two, appetite for bank M&A extending the franchise and how you think about that?\nBill Rogers: Yes. I mean right now, we have the best franchise to invest in and it's called Truist. And that's where our focus is and that's where our opportunity is. And ability to expand and create more capacity within our existing markets is really our primary focus right now.\nOperator: We'll move on to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Can you guys talk about the openness to maybe some restructuring of the securities portfolio? I mean obviously, rates have gone up a lot and the yields on your current book are a lot lower. So it would cost a lot to restructure a big part of it, but there might be some opportunities here and there as you think about the strong capital generation and what to use the capital for?\nMike Maguire: Matt, it's Mike, good morning and happy to react to that. As of this moment, there are no plans to restructure the securities portfolio. I think I mentioned that we do view the portfolio as a tool for funding loan growth. As that continues, it's creating cash flow of approximately $10 million to $15 million per year.\nBill Rogers: Yes, and Matt, I mean, today, we -- today, we're redeploying it into the growth in our business, and you acknowledge that would be very expensive. And what we try to do is look at that securities portfolio over time. And so we're going to take that cash flow. And right now, we've got great opportunities to reinvest it and not take a capital hit for the securities portfolio. I'd rather use that capital to invest in our business.\nMatt O'Connor: And then just separately, you had mentioned earlier some mix shift out of auto and mortgage. Can you frame how much you expect that to be over time? And then maybe you mentioned it, but just where is the mix shift going if it's out of mortgage and auto? What are you leaning into?\nBill Rogers: Yes, Matt, it's just basically sort of an overall return focus and make sure that we're maximizing our capital. As we see some of the returns in the mortgage business and the auto business being a little more stretched. We want to make sure we're serving our clients, and we're doing a great job in doing that. But by the same token, we're seeing the other opportunities in our commercial portfolio and our consumer portfolio. So we just want to get the right balance and a return focus versus we've never been sort of the growth for growth's sake. We want to be return-oriented. We want to maximize the return on the capital that we're investing in the portfolio.\nAnkur Vyas: Jake, I think we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: And that final question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian: I just I had one follow-up question, Bill. You got asked this several times, but I just wanted to make sure your shareholders understood what you were saying. You've been asked a lot about delivering operating leverage. At the same time, dislocation creates opportunity. And is this also a sort of once-in-a-cycle help from rates, right, in terms of operating leverage, helping the denominator? So is the message here really that you are going to always try to deliver positive operating leverage as a way of Truist Life, but you're seeing opportunities to invest today? And as we think about the tougher part of the cycle, whether we fall into a recession next year, and we don't have rate hikes helping. Your investments today are going to help Truist deliver above-average PPNR over a longer period of time other than just now when you're getting a lot of help from rates?\nBill Rogers: I think that's really well stated, and I wish I had stated it as well as your question. So no, I think that's exactly right. And as I mentioned, I mean positive operating leverage will be a hallmark of what we do. So that is -- that's core and focus of what we do. We just can't be wed to that quarter-to-quarter when we see an opportunity. So we're going to have positive operating leverage this year. It will be a little less than we'd hoped for six months ago, but we're investing that I think is going to create not only better operating leverage, but more importantly, strong PPNR growth for the future. And we just have to make sure that we're, for the benefit of our shareholders, thinking long term and thinking about this incredible opportunity that sits in front of us and maximizing our ability to capitalize on it. So I think you stated actually quite well.\nErika Najarian: And my last question is for Clarke. Thank you so much for sharing that data on your ACL. And just in terms of how CECL works, if we do hit a 4% unemployment rate, which is your base case, does that mean that you have to then wait worse scenarios in that 4%? In other words, do you say, okay, we hit 4%, that's our base case. We don't have to build reserves further, or does the model say, oh we're at 4%, it could get worse, so we now need to build for something worse than 4%?\nClarke Starnes: Great question. I would say, keep in mind that we run multiple scenarios. So we have our base case, which I described, but we also run a much more severe set of downside scenarios. And as we look forward, those scenarios get worse as well as even if the baseline deteriorates some additionally. So we weigh all of that, and we look at it each quarter. And so, even if the baseline is at one place, the downside scenarios may be more and would be more severe. So, we're going to look at all of that and decide how we weigh all of those factors and determine the allowance. And so yes, I mean, the downside scenario could push it even further even if the baseline is going up.\nAnkur Vyas: All right, thank you, Erica. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Jake, you may now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Very well. Once again, everyone, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter reflected strong progress in many areas overall. However, financial performance was mixed, reflecting continued challenging market conditions. Strong spread income resulted from significant margin expansion that exceeded our guidance and strong broad-based loan growth. Credit quality remains excellent. At the same time, capital markets revenue did not rebound as anticipated, and in fact, declined link quarter. Strategically, we continue to realize the benefits of shifting from integrating to operating, which I'll share more on later. I acknowledge that operating losses continue to be too high. However, other expense growth reflects targeted investments in talented technology in key areas of long-term sustainable growth. Merger calls diminished again, and our remaining decommissioning activities are mostly complete and be finalized by year-end. We'll share details on each of these themes throughout the call. And turning to our purpose on Slide 4, Truist is a purpose-driven company that's dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities. This commitment to purpose and our value of care could not have been more apparent in how our teammates responded to each other and their clients and the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. I experienced this firsthand when I visited with our teams in Southwest Florida soon after the storm subsided. Clients expressed their significant appreciation that we opened our branches to care for them during this time loss. The many truckloads of food, water supplies and other critical items that we sent to the region made a real difference. And the $1.25 million donation from the Truist Foundation will continue to provide support to affected areas in Florida. Have begun, and Truist is committed to supporting these communities in the short term, but also helping them be more resilient in the long term. And this is one of the many ways we're living our purpose, as you can see on Slide 5. In order to inspire, it's often necessary to be bold and to be first, and that's exactly what we did on October 1. We made a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 per hour. The new minimum wage benefits approximately 14,000 teammates, about 80% of whom are in client-facing roles. We strongly believe this action will drive purposeful growth and offset the estimated $200 million increase in annual personnel expense through improved teammate recruitment and retention, lower turnover expense, better execution and an all-around better client experience. In fact, we're already starting to see the benefits of the higher minimum wage. Teller turnover in August and September was down about 25% compared to the first seven months of the year. Our branch vacancy rates have been cut in half since July. We also advanced our commitment to inspire with the launch of Truist One Banking in July. Truist One is our differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking, including two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. The flagship Truist One checking account has zero overdraft fees and the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple $100 negative balance buffer. We also introduced the Truist Confidence Account, which provides consumers access to mainstream banking services and no overdraft fees. These accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and have been embraced by new and existing clients. Since their launch, overall branch deposit production has increased 13% in August and September compared to the prior year despite having 16% fewer branches. We're also in the process of rolling out our cash reserve deposit base credit line up to $750. We began a pilot earlier this month and expect the cash reserve feature to be available across our footprint later this quarter. Now turning to Slide 7. Merger costs totaled $152 million, down 30% sequentially and 58% year-over-year as our integration activities wind down. The final merger costs expected in the fourth quarter are primarily related to our decommissioning efforts, which, as I mentioned, will conclude by year-end. The completion of merger activities is a monumental move forward that will reflect a seamless client experience, simplify our narrative, enhance our earnings quality, improve capital and help us realize industry-leading returns. Turning to our third quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.15 per share on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.7 billion or $1.24 per share, up 3% sequentially as 5% adjusted PPNR growth was partially offset by higher provision as a result of our higher consumer net charge-offs. Net interest income grew 10% to a post-merger high, benefiting from higher short-term rates and well-controlled deposit costs, all of which drove significant margin expansion as well as strong broad-based loan growth. Despite solid forward progress, the pace of PPNR growth was weaker than we had anticipated, primarily due to ongoing pressure in investment banking, as well as unfavorable valuation marks taken at quarter end. Adjusted expenses increased 2.6% link quarter mostly as expected; however, operational losses remain elevated. While we made a purposeful decision to proactively refund our clients for fraud losses, our overall goal is to reduce them significantly to improve our results and the client experience. This is an industry-wide phenomenon. Part of our technology spend is directly related to this effort. These investments include efforts to enhance identity authentication and fraud detection, among others. Adjusted operating leverage was a strong 260 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting strong net interest income growth, combined with modest expense growth. This momentum has helped us close the gap towards our goal of positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Asset quality remains excellent, notwithstanding normalizing trends and a seasonal uptick and net charge-offs within our consumer portfolios. We deployed 10 basis points of capital to support strong loan growth and complete the Benefitmall acquisition, which expands our capabilities and fills a strategic gap in our wholesale insurance business. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile, and we're confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios. Now turning to Slide 9. Digital activity continues to increase from the first quarter levels, reflecting strong momentum post-integration. This progress reflects our significantly improved agility and responsiveness from being on one digital platform. Year-to-date, we've delivered 3x more production releases across business, retail and wealth than in all of 2021. Client satisfaction with their digital experience has also improved rapidly each quarter. Consistent with our pivot from integrating to operating, our technology and digital teams are allocating more of their time, energy and resources to transformation and innovation. To that end, we recently launched Truist Assist to our retail and wealth clients through our mobile and online banking platforms. Truist Assist is our AI-enhanced virtual assistant that leverages natural language processing and natural language understanding to interact and respond to client questions. Through September 30, Truist Assist had been deployed to our personal banking clients and had been utilized by 114,000 unique clients to handle 147,000 interactions that otherwise might have occurred in a branch or contact center. We're also expanding LightStream, both by enhancing the sophistication of its underwriting models through artificial intelligence, and by piloting a new savings product to broaden its capability set. In addition, the recent acquisition of the Arena platform from software start-up Zaloni will help accelerate our data journey through the development of a stronger integrated data infrastructure solution deployed in a hybrid cloud environment. As a result, our data quality, analytics and speed to market will all significantly improve. Overall, I'm highly optimistic about the potential of our increased investments and capabilities to enhance performance and client experience. Turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Loan growth was strong and broad-based for the second consecutive quarter. Average balances grew $13 billion or 4.3% sequentially in part due to our shift from integrating to operating. C&I remains strong as average balances grew $7 billion or 4.5%. C&I loans grew across most CIB industry verticals and product groups, reflecting higher revolver utilization, the current shift to banks from the bond market and our increased competitiveness for new and existing clients. Revolver utilization increased just over 100 basis points to approximately 31%, the highest level since the second quarter of 2020. In our commercial community bank, C&I balances, excluding PPP and dealer floor plan increased 1.3%, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. We achieved growth across almost all of our CCB regions. Residential mortgage balances increased $4 billion or 8.2%, reflecting previous correspondent mortgage production and slower prepayment speeds. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances increased 3.1%, a strong growth in Prime Auto, Service Finance, LightStream, recreational lending and Sheffield, more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios. Production in our consumer finance business is up 20% year-over-year, reflecting good business development momentum with Service Finance, abating inventory shortages within Sheffield and RAC and improved automated decisioning capabilities across the board, which ultimately improves consistency, efficiency and creates better client experiences. Near term, our loan growth outlook remains healthy as our pipelines are relatively strong and teammates continue to shift their capacity from integrating to operating and take advantage of new tools in their toolkit. Over the medium term, loan growth may moderate as clients absorb and digest the impact of higher rates, higher inflation and slowing growth. We also expect growth in residential mortgage and Prime Auto to slow going forward as we shift our capital towards higher return opportunities. Truist continues to remain well-positioned to advise clients across a broad range of economic scenarios, given our capabilities, talented teammates and increased capacity post integration. Now turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposits decreased $3.7 billion or just under 1% in the third quarter driven by tightening monetary policy, reduced savings in response to higher inflation and seasonal patterns. Deposit costs were very well-controlled, reflecting Truist's strong retail and commercial franchise and our enviable market share position. In addition, our lines of business and corporate treasury teams continued to deliver excellent execution against a thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. As a result, interest-bearing cumulative deposit betas have been 21% thus far, well below our modeled assumptions. As the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid, particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding. Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to acknowledge and thank Daryl Bible. He has built a best-in-class finance function. He played a key essential role in the success of our merger, and he's really been incredibly supportive in helping Mike transition into the CFO role. Many of you in the investment community know Daryl well, and appreciate his knowledge and transparency, which will continue to be hallmarks of Truist going forward. I'm also excited to introduce Mike Maguire as our new CFO. Most recently, Mike led Truist Consumer Finance and Payments businesses including LightStream, Service Finance, Sheffield and Auto Finance. He was also responsible for our Enterprise Payment Strategy Group and Wholesale Payments businesses, including Treasury Solutions, Merchant Services and Commercial Card. Mike is a strategic thinker, a purpose-driven leader with an exceptional depth of experience across our enterprise and a deep understanding of how technology is shaping our operating environment. He's truly an industry thought leader in the fintech space. We'll certainly draw on this experience as Mike assumes his new role during this time of exciting transformation. So Mike, with that, I'm going to turn it over to you. Great. Thank you, Mike. Continuing to our strategic shift on Slide 18. Earlier this year, I expressed my view that the first quarter was a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Our third quarter results build upon the second quarter progress even as market conditions diminished overall PPNR trajectory, progress is real and it's palpable. We've made significant progress in our digital and technology areas as evidenced by improving mobile app ratings and enhanced client experience within treasury and payments and many other new features and capabilities that strengthen the financial confidence of our clients. Speed to answer in our care centers is now well below our initial service level agreements and more investment will improve the efficiency as well. Loan production in the third quarter was highest it's been at Truist, up 8% compared to the second quarter. Branch loan and deposit production are up a solid 14% and 20% like quarter, respectively, as teammates become more confident with processes and systems, but also improve solutions and capabilities. IRM referrals to our wealth businesses increased 17% sequentially and the amount of income generated from IRM referrals by our commercial community bank was the second highest ever both highlighting the power of our advice-driven and client-centric model. Our brand awareness was up almost 400 basis points in the third quarter while our peers were flat to down. And our brand consideration which measures whether consumers are giving Truist a serious thought was 210 basis points and ranks us fifth highest in our markets, having only been alive for that brand for three years. Almost all of our client satisfaction scores are ascending and in many cases, at their highest levels since we become Truist. The financial benefits of this momentum are being realized and will be increasingly visible as market conditions normalize and merger-related expense noise abates. To conclude, Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis on Slide 19. Strategically, we have shifted from execution to execution, transformation and growth. We're investing in digital and technology as we reduce cost, including operational losses. We're simplifying our processes and operations, and we're acting on our purpose each and every day with a singular goal of improving our client experience. We're also intensely focused on capturing the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as it's squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients. These shifts in activities do not require incremental risk appetite or capital, just execution and focus, both of which lie within our sphere of control. Externally, while we believe the economy is generally healthy, persistent high inflation and a rapid tightening of monetary policy, combined with geopolitical tensions, have reduced visibility and increased uncertainty as we move into 2023. Truist is nevertheless well-positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice-oriented model for clients, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, and our strong capital position relative to our risk profile and our significant performance momentum as we continue the shift from integration to execution and growth. Ankur, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. Yes. I think well obviously for the balance of the year, we talked about this as well, but I think we'll have positive operating leverage for the year. As we look into 2023, obviously, there are a lot of puts and takes. There's a lot of uncertainty headed into that. But positive operating leverage is going to be a core tenet of what we do. So if we look at the revenue potential in terms of the loan growth and deposit production we've had, being able to capitalize on those opportunities with those clients as we move forward, so even if the economy slows down a bit, we still have a lot of momentum in that area. We've got great strength in our insurance business. We've got great strength in our overall capital markets business. Wealth has been building its capability. So, we've got a lot of engines and tailwind from that side. And then, we've got a lot of tailwind on the cost sides. So, we'll complete the bulk of the merger cost saves at the end of this year. But heading into next year is really where we get to leverage all those. If you think about the concept of you put two things together, now you make those two things more efficient. So those opportunities for digitization and automation, we're consolidating our card platform. All the things that will continue on in terms of cost saves. So, I'm just -- I am not giving you specific guidance on operating leverage for the year other than to say that will be a core tenet and component of how we plan for the future. And Ken, maybe just to add to that in terms of the first part of the question, too, is just the strength of our deposit franchise. It's pretty granular, 42% under $250,000. We've got really good market share. But what we're seeing, I talked about this in my prepared comments, our production's really strong. Truist One has been really successful. Our teammates have really responded, clients and both new clients and existing clients have really responded, investments in treasury and payments. So, we're leaning into this in terms of our own capabilities from the deposit production side. And then for the fourth quarter, remember, the third quarter has got some seasonality in things like public funds, for example, where that's a strong area for us. So, I think we'll be sort of stable in the fourth quarter. And then Mike talked, I think, eloquently about the funding side. The great news is we have something to deploy it towards, which is perfect. Michael, I'll let you start, and I'll talk about that as well. To Mike's point, a lot of it also depend on loan growth and what we see going into next year, really positive momentum through this quarter, which I think will continue into the fourth quarter. It all for -- it's a little murkier as we head into next year, but I like the momentum and the production and the pipelines and the relevance and the competitiveness of our franchise right now from that standpoint. Yes, I think overall, I mean, we've talked about this. It's the measurement of can we grow revenue long term over time and PPNR faster and relative to our market opportunities. And I think that opportunity sits squarely in front of us. I think if I look at the things that contribute to that in the areas of production, like loan production, AUM production, deposit production, I'd argue, actually, we're sort of getting to sort of a peak kind of performance in those areas. As it relates to the expense side, and this stuff just doesn't go quarter-to-quarter. You just -- they're going to have different levels of investment. We've made a conscious decision. And while I'll acknowledge, I'm cranky on the operating losses side. So operational losses, I think we've got some opportunity there. I see some improvements coming, but that has been longer and taken longer than I had anticipated, but we're consciously investing in some areas. So we're consciously investing in investment banking and wealth and insurance. And you know us well. I mean we've got a good track record here. When times are a little bumpy and the opportunity is there, we've taken advantage of it, and that's proven to be really, really smart investments on our standpoint. So, we're sort of unabashed about that, and that has a quarter-to-quarter implication to it. And I just have to absorb it and take it because I'm confident that we're doing the things that will create better opportunity for us and allow us to gain share over time. So long answer to a short direct question, I think we can grow disproportionately over time. It just won't look like that quarter-to-quarter. And I think look at the production, look at the capabilities that we're creating today, and I'm confident in manifesting those towards the future. Yes, I'll start, Betsy, if it can also turn it over to Clarke, he's itching to get in and talk about credit quality and the quality of the portfolio and what we put on the books. We've not diminished our commitment to credit quality. We're taking our clients through the appropriate stress testing process. I mean we're underwriting at new rates and new environments. So, I think our production just reflects our just competitiveness. I mean our ability to win more size and relevance with our clients. And then you see that reflected right now in our reserve, particularly on the wholesale side. The quality actually is -- might argue might be improving. So Clarke, why don't you embellish that, if you would? Yes, Clarke, why don't you take that? I think you characterized it right that as part of the benefits of the merger is the diversification of that portfolio by definition of the denominator. So, we haven't grown it in proportion to the increase in the size of our business, and it's well-diversified. Leverage portfolio is well diversified. Exposures are not significant to any one person. And it's about 50% sponsors and about 50% on us. So this is a business that supports our client base, and it's categorized as leverage, but it's really supporting the growth in our client base and consistent with our strategy of helping our clients with their business life cycles. I mean I think -- so it's a little bit different and a little more focused on an on-us component. Yes, thanks, Mike. And we'll continue to keep the corvette network going, I guess. But if we define speed as related to how are you doing against your markets, I look at the loan deposit AUM, the production side. And I'd say we're actually at a really good high rate of speed. And I'd say we're at our speed that reflects the opportunity that sits in our market. So if we define it that way, if we define the opportunity, which I 100% agree with is to have improved positive operating leverage overtime and increased revenue and PPNR growth. We also have to invest to make that happen. So we like you to see the same things that you're seeing in our markets, and we've got to make sure that we invest in those. And again, I wish it sort of balanced out quarter-to-quarter. It just doesn't. So the opportunities for us to invest right now, and I think gain share long term in areas I mentioned before, like investment banking, like insurance, like wealth, we're just going to do that. And I think that's going to have a good long-term impact for us. You've seen this before, you've seen this movie and you know how well it ends for us. So we know how to do this. So I'm very confident on that side. And then the part about the operational losses and the commitments that we made to our clients, those are also good long-term decisions. I mean, look, we were in the middle of a merger. We gave the benefit of the doubt to a client. Whenever there was a benefit of a doubt, I think long term, that's going to create sustainable long-term relationships and the same thing with teammates. Increasing minimum wage is fantastic for shareholders. I cited some of the stats that we're seeing already an improved turnover and improved vacancy rates. I didn't mention the care center. We're seeing that as well. So long term, that's going to have a tremendous benefit for our shareholders, as well as our teammates. So I'm confident. I think we're materializing the things that we want to have. It's just not coming in quarter-to-quarter as I'd like. It's not as matched as I'd like. There are some pesky things that I think will come down, and I'm already seeing that at the end of the quarter and the first of this quarter in terms of operational losses. So, we can have a cleaner more focused, easier to understand and easier to have the production and those things result in the kind of PPNR growth that I think we're able to do long term. Yes. I mean right now, we have the best franchise to invest in and it's called Truist. And that's where our focus is and that's where our opportunity is. And ability to expand and create more capacity within our existing markets is really our primary focus right now. Yes, and Matt, I mean, today, we -- today, we're redeploying it into the growth in our business, and you acknowledge that would be very expensive. And what we try to do is look at that securities portfolio over time. And so we're going to take that cash flow. And right now, we've got great opportunities to reinvest it and not take a capital hit for the securities portfolio. I'd rather use that capital to invest in our business. Yes, Matt, it's just basically sort of an overall return focus and make sure that we're maximizing our capital. As we see some of the returns in the mortgage business and the auto business being a little more stretched. We want to make sure we're serving our clients, and we're doing a great job in doing that. But by the same token, we're seeing the other opportunities in our commercial portfolio and our consumer portfolio. So we just want to get the right balance and a return focus versus we've never been sort of the growth for growth's sake. We want to be return-oriented. We want to maximize the return on the capital that we're investing in the portfolio. I think that's really well stated, and I wish I had stated it as well as your question. So no, I think that's exactly right. And as I mentioned, I mean positive operating leverage will be a hallmark of what we do. So that is -- that's core and focus of what we do. We just can't be wed to that quarter-to-quarter when we see an opportunity. So we're going to have positive operating leverage this year. It will be a little less than we'd hoped for six months ago, but we're investing that I think is going to create not only better operating leverage, but more importantly, strong PPNR growth for the future. And we just have to make sure that we're, for the benefit of our shareholders, thinking long term and thinking about this incredible opportunity that sits in front of us and maximizing our ability to capitalize on it. So I think you stated actually quite well."

            "name": "Mike Maguire",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would also like to thank Daryl for his guidance and his support throughout my transition into the CFO role. I'm excited about the opportunity, and I'm confident that the transition will be seamless for all of our stakeholders. I also want to thank my teammates in the finance organization for welcoming me and for their support. We have a really talented team, and I look forward to working with all of them. For our analysts and investors, I'll be on the road soon, and hope to meet as many of you as possible. This is really a great opportunity, and I'm excited about helping take Truist to new heights. So moving to Slide 12, for the quarter, net interest income increased 10% sequentially to $3.8 billion as higher short-term interest rates and strong loan growth more than offset lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest income was up a strong 14%. Deposit costs remain well-controlled, reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise. Lower purchase accounting accretion was the result of elevated accretion in previous periods due to conversion activity and slowing prepays in the current period. Reported net interest margin increased 23 basis points, while core net interest margin increased 30 basis points, driven by similar trends as net interest income. Moving to Slide 13, fee income decreased $146 million or 6.5% sequentially. Insurance income decreased $100 million primarily due to seasonally lower property and casualty commissions. Investment banking and trading income decreased $33 million as lower fees from structured real estate, investment grade and high-yield bonds and syndicated and leveraged finance were partially offset by increased M&A fees. Wider credit spreads, tightening liquidity and general macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty are all contributing to slower activity levels. Despite these current headwinds, we continue to make strong strategic progress within Corporate and Investment Banking. Capital Markets revenue from non-corporate and investment banking clients is up 25% year-over-year as our commercial community bank, commercial real estate and wealth teammates continue to learn how to successfully partner with CIB to deliver strategic advice to our clients. Our lead table position has improved across most products, including equity capital markets, high yield, investment grade and syndicated and leveraged finance. Given the strategic progress, we intend to continue to take advantage of the challenging environment to invest in Truist Securities by selectively adding talent to drive long-term share gains as we've successfully done during previous market disruptions. Other income, excluding impacts from our non-qualified plan, decreased $17 million link quarter, primarily due to valuation-related marks. Compared to a year ago, other income decreased $81 million as a result of lower investment income and valuation marks on SBIC-related and other strategic investments. Turning to Slide 14, adjusted non-interest expense increased $83 million or 2.6% sequentially, reflecting forward-focused investments in talent and technology, as well as elevated operational losses. Professional fees and outside processing expense increased $34 million on an adjusted basis as we advanced critical projects, including investments in cybersecurity, contact center modernization, fraud detection and the build-out of our in-house payments capabilities. Other expense increased $28 million, primarily due to higher operational losses. Personnel expense increased $23 million on an adjusted basis, reflecting strategic and purposeful additions in technology, commercial community banking, CIB, consumer finance and wealth, as well as the BenefitMall acquisition. Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest expense only increased 2%. This modest increase was driven by higher operational losses and investment spend, which were partially offset by merger-related cost savings in software and net occupancy expense. Overall, we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longer-term investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage. As an example, we believe recent technology investments to enhance identity authentication, fraud detection, among other factors, will mitigate operational losses. Also, with the conversion behind us, we have additional flexibility to rationalize certain businesses such as mortgage, where capacity exceeds demand. Lastly, we have our final leg of data center-related technology savings that is expected to materialize throughout the fourth quarter. Below the line, our third quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of 18.2% down from 19.5% in the second quarter primarily due to discrete tax benefits arising from final true-ups to our 2021 tax return. We continue to expect a normal effective tax rate to be 20% which translates to 21% on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Moving to Slide 15, asset quality continues to be excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio. Leading credit indicators remain strong. Non-performing loans decreased 1 basis point and loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 7 basis points. Net charge-offs remained benign at 27 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily due to normalizing trends and seasonality in certain consumer portfolios. Our total allowance increased $18 million to support our loan growth and the ALLL ratio decreased 4 basis points due to strong portfolio performance and growth in higher-quality loans, partially offset by a moderately slower economic outlook. Moving on to Slide 16, our CET1 ratio decreased from 9.2% to 9.1% as we deployed capital to support strong loan growth and to complete the BenefitMall acquisition. We also increased the dividend 8% to $0.52 per share beginning in the third quarter, reflecting our confidence in our improving earnings trajectory. Overall, our capital position remains strong in light of our risk and profitability profile, and we maintain a strong liquidity position with access to multiple sources of funding for incremental loan growth. Turning now to Slide 17, I'll next outline the strategic rationale and financial impact of two recently announced insurance acquisitions. First, BenefitMall closed on September 1, providing a scaled entry into wholesale employee benefits and filling one of the remaining strategic gaps in our capability set. BenefitMall is expected to add $160 million of annual revenue at an initial EBITDA margin in the mid-20% that will build to the mid-30% over time as synergies are realized. The transaction also has potential earn benefits within Truist Insurance by supporting our brokers at McGriff, our retail insurance business and also outside Truist Insurance with our corporate and commercial clients. We also recently announced the acquisition of BankDirect Capital Finance. Strategically, BankDirect effectively doubles our premium finance business, broadens our capabilities to include life insurance and expands our West Coast presence. Pro forma, we estimate Truist Insurance Holdings will be the number two premium finance player in the market after this deal closes later this quarter. BankDirect brings with it a $3.2 billion loan portfolio with strong projected growth, attractive profitability, limited credit risk and short duration. While both acquisitions are expected to be dilutive initially, we believe they are strategic and financially attractive over the long run. So, I'll now provide new guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid double-digit basis point increase in both our core and reported net interest margin due to benefits from the recent rate hikes and a projected 75 basis point hike in November. Fees will rebound sequentially, driven by insurance income improving due to seasonality, solid organic growth and the full impact of the BenefitMall acquisition. The extent to which investment banking fees improve will be dictated by levels of capital markets activity. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase approximately 1% as the increase to minimum wage, investments and revenue-producing businesses and technology and acquisitions are partially offset by the impacts of cost savings. Putting these pieces all together, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow approximately 10% with some upside based on the realization of investment banking pipelines. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter expectations, we are on track to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year. We remain consistent with our expectations that the net charge-off ratio will be between 25 and 35 basis points for the full year due to our performance year-to-date and normalizing trends across our loan portfolio. With that, I will turn it back to Bill to conclude. This is Mike, I'm happy to take that one. So, you're right, we've been very pleased by the performance of the deposit portfolio so far at 21%. I think we said earlier this year, we expected betas to be closer to 30% as we get to the second half of the year. We still expect that to be the case by year-end. In terms of a terminal beta, very, very hard to tell, we've seen probably some lag given the rate at which rates have increased. And so, we do expect there to be some catch-up, but whether or not it will be to the tune of the previous cycle in the mid-30s or beyond, we'll observe that together. Ken, it's Mike, I'll start here as well. So again, we have been very pleased from the deposit perspective with only a sequential decrease of 1%. And so very pleased by how the balances are hanging in there. We are expecting, I think, over the near term, to continue to have some pressure on deposits, as well as some pressure on mix. We did see some shift from DDA into interest-bearing. That's been a moderate shift so far, and we're still well above levels that we experienced pre-COVID. But we are beginning to see that shift take place. In terms of short-term borrowings, you're right, we are accessing brokered markets. We are accessing short-term markets and do expect that to continue over the intermediate term. But don't expect that to shift significantly. As we think about funding, loan growth for one has been very, very high. So far year-to-date, we do expect loan growth to moderate somewhat, which should alleviate some of that gap. But between the deposit balance levels, between leveraging some of the securities portfolio running off to the tune of $10 billion to $15 billion per year, accessing some of the wholesale markets, which is a pretty wide array of tools and even thinking about the capital markets, we feel really good about our funding capability. Yes, I mean the cash flow that's coming off is being invested in the loan portfolio. There's de minimis investing to support our CRA efforts, but the bulk of the cash flow is being invested in loans. Yes. Yes, Ryan, you're right. I mean, look, we've got a really good trajectory going into Q4 with the NIM, as we mentioned in our guide, expected to increase 15 or so basis points. Look, as long as rates continue to increase, we expect to continue to see some NIM expansion. At some point, I think we all expect to achieve this terminal policy rate and whether it's higher longer or begins to decline, we'll see. From an NII perspective, we'll obviously benefit from that NIM expansion over that period. And then I think as NIMs begin to feel some pressure, we feel good again today. We've got really nice earning asset growth. We expect that to moderate, but should offset any impact over the intermediate term of the decline in NIM. We see '23 from a rates perspective as a relatively stable period. Yes, Mike, good morning and happy to react to that. I mean, I think, first and foremost, still, at this point, absorbing and coming in and meeting the team, getting a sense for where we are. Look, Bill made some great points. I don't come to the table with some predefined view or silver bullet as it relates to these things. The headwinds that Bill talked about, minimum wage, inflation, some of the investments that we're prioritizing, they're important. But then again, we have some great tailwinds as well, whether it'd be realizing the benefits of the savings. I think there's some benefit from an automation perspective, some work we're doing that's in more nascent phase, and then just overall productivity. I mean, look, if we -- I think we've got a great track record in terms of being able to manage expense. If and when that becomes a more important priority based on market conditions, but no, I think Bill said it well, Mike. Matt, it's Mike, good morning and happy to react to that. As of this moment, there are no plans to restructure the securities portfolio. I think I mentioned that we do view the portfolio as a tool for funding loan growth. As that continues, it's creating cash flow of approximately $10 million to $15 million per year."

            "name": "Clarke Starnes",
            "content": "Yes, thanks, Bill, and I agree with you. We're very careful in our underwriting right now. So we're looking obviously at rate shock and the ability to absorb that. We're looking at other things like pricing power and their margins, given supply and input costs and inflation, looking at clients' investment decisions, how they're deploying capital, their liquidity, their balance sheet and just overall strength. So, we feel really good about the core underwriting. In fact, I would tell you for the quarter, about 95% of our C&I production was investment grade or near investment grade credit, so really high quality there. And as far as our NCO guidance for the full year, we feel really good about where we are. But remember, we normalize as we go into the fourth quarter from a consumer standpoint and we have the seasonal impact. So that's really truly the consumer side that may increase losses on. Yes, maybe I'll start it, Bill. First, from an SNC standpoint, we're in really good shape. We just went through the exam and had great results. I feel very good about that. We have about $59 billion in outstandings in our SNC book. So it's about 19% of our balances, and that's been fairly steady or so. So, it's a very diversified book. We feel really good about that. As far as our leveraged finance book, just remember, that's about 7% of our total book; however, over half of that is 55% investment-grade clients. So really 3% would be more in the sponsored or non-investment grade side. That book's performing extremely well today. So minimal NPLs, we've had about 9 basis points of losses and are criticized are in good shape. So while there's been disruption and challenges in the market, our overall performance has been very, very good. That's a great question. In our base case, which we wait at 40%, we have unemployment going up to 4% and then going higher into the mid-4s as we go into '23 and beyond. So clearly, a little more pessimistic on as we ran the reserves this quarter. I would say for us, other big drivers would be a housing HPI would be another input there in our models, and you've already mentioned GDP. So from our standpoint, the big driver for us would be the scenario weighting and the scenario outlook would have the biggest impact on our reserves, obviously, versus other things like our mix of production and our overall portfolio performance. But right now, I think the scenario outlook would be the biggest driver. Great question. I would say, keep in mind that we run multiple scenarios. So we have our base case, which I described, but we also run a much more severe set of downside scenarios. And as we look forward, those scenarios get worse as well as even if the baseline deteriorates some additionally. So we weigh all of that, and we look at it each quarter. And so, even if the baseline is at one place, the downside scenarios may be more and would be more severe. So, we're going to look at all of that and decide how we weigh all of those factors and determine the allowance. And so yes, I mean, the downside scenario could push it even further even if the baseline is going up."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning. Trust delivered a good second quarter, reflecting our improving momentum after the integration and the resiliency of our diverse business mix in a volatile market environment. Our financial results modestly exceeded the guidance we provided in April with several puts and takes. Loan growth was strong and broad-based. Net interest margin expanded significantly due to higher interest rates in our strong deposit franchise. Credit quality remains excellent and we are pleased by our relative and absolute performance in the recent stress test. In light of these results, our Board will consider a resolution to increase the common dividend by 8% at its July meeting. This quarter's performance, combined with improving client experience trends and dramatically lower merger costs, reflects the initial benefits of our shift from integrating to operating. While there's still work to do, such as stemming elevated operational losses, closing out residual integration issues and completing our decommissioning process, I am very confident in Truist's trajectory and reaffirm our commitment to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year of 2022. I'm going to share some more details on those topics in a moment. Then going to Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is fundamentally a deep, purpose-led company dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities. We know that our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose drives performance and defines how we do business every day. It very intentionally begins with the word Inspire, and to be inspirational, it's often necessary to be bold and to be first. I'll highlight four examples that I think reflect that purpose on the next slide. First and foremost, we recently announced that we're making a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 an hour effective October 1. This increase will benefit approximately 14,000 teammates, about 80% of whom will have client-facing roles in a retail and small business banking business. Purposeful growth is dependent on attracting and retaining the best talent. In addition to our industry-leading benefits, we designed a compensation program that also helps teammates who needed most who want the impact of inflation in their daily lives. Second, we had a historic launch of Truist One Banking yesterday. This is our new differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking, including two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. The flagship Truist One checking account has zero overdraft fees and the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple $100 negative balance buffer. We also introduced the Truist Confidence Account, which provides consumers with access to main street banking services and no overdraft fees. We're mindful of the impact that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on some of our clients, and Truist One is one of many examples of how we're advancing financial inclusion across our communities. Third, Truist committed $120 million to strengthen and support diverse and small businesses. This commitment exemplifies our purpose by supporting small businesses, which are so vital to the health and vibrancy of our communities. And fourth, we released our 2021 ESG and CSR report in early June. At Truist, we view all the elements of ESG as an opportunity to improve our company and to put our purpose into action, and that includes climate change. As we look to externalize our own net zero aspirations and further the transition to a lower carbon economy, we recently created new advisory practices within our CIB and commercial community bank to help our clients make their own transition. We're pleased with how our clients have welcomed and embraced our advice and expertise around ESG as it underscores the possibilities in viewing ESG as an opportunity for growth. Now turning to Slide 7. Consistent with our previous guidance, merger-related costs totaled $238 million, roughly half of what they were in the first quarter. We expect merger costs to decrease significantly in the back half of 2022 before going away entirely in 2023. This trajectory should be welcome news to shareholders as diminishing merger costs correspond to a less complex narrative, improving earnings quality, more capital and, ultimately, industry-leading returns. Lastly, we incurred a $39 million pre-tax gain related to the early extinguishment of $800 million in FHLB debt. Turning to our second quarter performance highlights on the next slide. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.09 a share on a reported basis. Excluding the selected items on Slide 7, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $1.20 a share, down 23% compared to a year ago, primarily due to a sizable reserve release in the prior quarter. Relative to the first quarter, adjusted EPS decreased 2% as higher loan loss provision offset a 10% increase in adjusted PPNR. Adjusted revenue benefited from higher short-term rates alongside well-controlled deposit costs, strong loan growth, consumer seasonality and strong insurance results, partially offset by continued softness in market-sensitive fee businesses such as investment banking, wealth and mortgage. Adjusted ROTCE was 25%, up from 23% in the prior three quarters, even when normalizing things like AOCI to zero and assuming a flat ALLL ratio, adjusted ROTCE was a strong 17%. Adjusted expenses increased 3.8%, reflecting higher insurance-related incentive compensation and intentional investments in talent and technology to support our shift from integrating to operating. Other expenses also increased due to normalization of teammate travel and elevated operational losses. We have planned products, processes and technology enhancements underway to reduce these losses and enhance the overall client experience, including the launch of innovative authentication approaches later this quarter. While operating leverage was a negative 200 basis points year-to-date, this primarily reflects the $435 million year-to-date headwind we have from PPP and PAA revenue. Despite these headwinds, we're still targeting positive operating leverage on both a GAAP and adjusted basis for the full year. Asset quality remains excellent and net charge-offs decreased relative to the first quarter. Capital deployment was healthy in the second quarter as we funded strong loan growth and completed $150 million worth of share repurchases. Capital levels remain strong in light of our risk and profitability profile, demonstrated by our continued strong performance in the 2022 CCAR process. Overall, the second quarter begins to reflect the power of Truist post integration. Now turning to Slide 9. Digital activity increased in the second quarter, attributable to seasonality and nearly 200 enhancements we implemented across the platform, representing a significantly higher pace of value delivery for our clients. Our ability to rapidly incorporate client feedback reflects the capabilities of a more modern and agile digital platform and has resulted in improved client satisfaction scores, which have risen consistently since our initial introduction of Truist Digital in waves in 2021. In June, we announced the grand opening of our state-of-the-art Innovation and Technology Center located within our headquarters, the ITC provides an environment conducive to reimagining the client experience such as by facilitating new ways of working with Agile teams to better collaborate with clients to co-create dynamic and marketable cross-channel services. The new space features client journey rooms, a maker space for building, testing and refining new products and services; a reality lab, where we can utilize virtual and augmented reality technology; and a contact center incubator where we can collect and respond to real-time feedback directly from our clients. I'm personally excited about our improved ability to aid our teammates as they reimagine how we serve clients. We also acquired San Francisco-based Long Game, the award-winning gamification app that utilizes behavioral economics, price link savings and mobile gaming to motivate positive financial behaviors and drive new account growth and client retention. By leveraging Long Game's innovative technology, Truist can empower our clients to build long-term financial wellness. I'm also pleased to report that our merger integration activities are now complete. Our final merger release was rolled out in May and we recently held our last merger Oversight Committee meeting. As we shift to BAU, our digital and technology teams are looking forward to accelerating our pace of innovation and client experience improvements. Yesterday, as I mentioned, we introduced Truist One. And as I referenced earlier -- as I referenced earlier, we will soon expand LightStream to include a new deposit product on a real-time, cloud-based core, enhance the sophistication of our underwriting models through a partnership with Zest; roll out Truist Assist, our virtual assistant to millions of clients, just to name a few examples. Overall, we're increasingly optimistic about the performance and the potential of our increased investment and focus on digital and technology. Now turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Average loan balances increased a very robust $8.1 billion or 2.8% sequentially with growth across most businesses. The pace of growth accelerated during the quarter with end-of-period loans up 4.7%. Growth was primarily driven by C&I, where average balances increased $6.7 billion or 4.8% overall. We delivered broad-based loan growth across most CIB industry verticals, notably energy, consumer and retail, financial institutions, TMT. Due to M&A activity, the current shift to banks from the bond market increased relevance with new and existing clients and a higher revolver usage for CapEx, inventories and inflation. As in recent quarters, growth continues to be strong within our Asset Finance group as we continue to build out that business with more talent, product capabilities and a larger balance sheet. Commercial Community Bank C&I balances increased 2%, excluding PPP and dealer floor plan, reflecting growth across all our geographic regions and was the second strongest end of period growth since 2019. Revolver utilization increased 300 basis points to just over 30%, the highest level since mid 2020. CRE remains a headwind, reflecting both the highly competitive market and our disciplined approach. At the same time though, I continue to be optimistic about the future of our CRE business as we create a more strategic \u2013 as we create more strategic clarity internally and non-bank competition rationalizes somewhat with rising rates. Wealth lending was up $600 million sequentially as our advisers and clients continue to benefit from the combined capabilities of both heritage firms. Residential mortgage increased 2.6%, reflecting ongoing correspondent purchases and slower prepayment fees. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances increased $1 billion or 1.3% as strong growth in Service Finance, Prime Auto, Sheffield and LightStream more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios. Service Finance is performing in line with our high expectations and experiencing good business development momentum given the alignment with Truist. Second quarter production by Service Finance was about double the volume loss and double the profitability from our terminated partnerships. Our prime auto business is also back on its front foot after regaining some momentum it lost following its own fourth quarter conversion. In addition, our consumer finance businesses continue to advance their automated decision capabilities which ultimately improves consistency, efficiency and creates better client experiences. Overall, clients are generally positive on current economic conditions and demand in their businesses. At the same time, concerns about labor shortages and margin pressure, given rising rates and higher input costs, are growing, creating the potential for more defensive postures. Truist is well positioned to advise clients across a range of scenarios given our broad capabilities and talented teammates. Given all of this, we remain generally positive about our prospects for continued loan growth, particularly taking into account our post-integration momentum. At the same time, we have to acknowledge the increased uncertainty associated with the softening economic environment, which may cause loan growth to deviate from this outlook. Turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposit balances increased $8.5 billion or 2% during the second quarter, largely attributable to an increase in brokered deposits in mid-March. Excluding brokered deposits, average deposits decreased $2.9 billion or 0.7%. Deposit costs were very well controlled, reflecting Truist's strong retail and commercial oriented franchise and our enviable market share position. In addition, our lines of business and corporate treasury teams delivered excellent execution against a thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. As a result, interest-bearing client deposit betas were 8%, well below our modeled assumptions. As the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid, particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding. And now let me turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail.\nDaryl Bible: Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income increased 7% sequentially, driven by higher short-term interest rates alongside limited deposit betas in addition to strong loan growth. We also saw a positive asset mix shift with the investment portfolio shrinking and funding strong loan growth. As Bill indicated, the strong quality of our deposit franchise also limited deposit rate repricing. Reported net interest margin increased 13 basis points and core net interest margin increased 15 basis points. Net interest margin and net interest income increased for similar reasons and exceeded the high end of our April guidance, primarily due to our teammates delivering lower than modeled deposit betas. Overall, we continue to take a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk. We continue to be asset sensitive and that will decrease over time with the diminishing benefit associated with future rate increases and the disintermediation of funding sources. We forecasted an approximate 25% cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta through the second and third quarters. To protect against any potential downside in rates, we also added $16 billion of swaps, which are primarily forward starting. These swaps begin in 2023 and 2024 and will have laddered maturities that range from three to five years to minimize earnings volatility. Moving to Slide 13. Fee income increased $106 million or 4.9% sequentially. Insurance income increased $98 million due to the seasonality, strong organic growth and the full quarter of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. Car and payment-related fees increased $34 million, reflecting the prior quarter acquisition of merchant relationships and the increased activity. Residential mortgage income decreased $15 million or 17% as higher interest rates pressured volumes and gain-on-sale margins. Servicing income was essentially flat from the prior quarter as lower prepays were offset by increasing hedging costs. While this is a very challenging environment for mortgage, our mortgage team is playing some offense. By leveraging Truist's strong purpose and balance sheet to hire select, well-regarded loan officers as well as acquire certain servicing portfolios. Investment banking and trading income was relatively flat sequentially and declined 37% year-over-year as market volatility continues to negatively impact most products. Investment banking pipelines remain full across all products, but the realization of these pipelines will continue to remain subject to more stable market conditions. Service charges on deposits were relatively flat sequentially as favorable seasonal trends were offset by the elimination of certain overdraft fees in April, resulting in client savings of approximately $20 million during the quarter.  We included a table at the bottom of Slide 13 to make other income trends more clear. Other income, excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and last quarter's merchant gain, decreased $25 million, primarily due to a loss on a certain sale of SBIC funds to diversify our private equity investment portfolio.  Turning to Slide 14. Reported expenses decreased $94 million sequentially to $3.6 billion. The lower expenses were driven by $180 million or 43% reduction in merger costs due to diminishing integration activity. Adjusted expenses increased $119 million. Personnel expenses increased $64 million due to seasonally higher insurance-related incentive compensation, the full impact of normal first quarter compensation increases and ongoing investments in talent across our lines of business and technology teams.  In addition, other expense increased $19 million due to higher operational losses and ongoing normalization of teammate travel. Professional fees and outside processing costs increased $16 million, primarily due to the increase in call center staffing. As Bill mentioned, our minimum wage will increase to $22 per hour effective October 1. This represents a significant investment in our teammates and is expected to increase our personnel expense by $200 million annually, offset by lower turnover expense and improved execution and client experience.  Moving to Slide 15. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio and solid economic conditions. Leading credit indicators remain benign. Criticized and classified commercial loans decreased 6% sequentially and are 37% lower to a year ago. Our NPL ratio was flat at 36 basis points and loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 3 basis points to 69 basis points. Our net charge-off ratio also decreased 3 basis points to 22 basis points. We experienced a slight build in the allowance due to loan growth. Although the allowance coverage ratio decreased 6 basis points to 138 basis points, given our strong portfolio performance, tempered somewhat by our moderately slower economic outlook. While the weighting of our pessimistic baseline and optimistic scenarios were unchanged from the first quarter, each scenario is moderately worse, a trend that may continue. Moving on Slide 16. Our CET1 ratio declined 20 basis points to 9.2%, strong loan growth and a $250 million share repurchase during the second quarter. As previously announced, our Board will consider an 8% increase in the quarterly common dividend at its July meeting. If approved, the increase will take effect in the third quarter and will continue to position Truist as one of the dividend leaders in our peer group. We were also pleased with the performance during the 2022 stress test. Truist had the second lowest CET1 erosion and a loan loss reserve rate in the peer group under severely adverse scenario. Our preliminary stress test capital buffer remained flat at 250 basis points. We believe these results demonstrate our strong capital relative to the risk and profitability profile, the latter of which should improve over time. We are now more comfortable operating below our previously announced CET1 ratio target of 9.75% given our continued strong stress test results and significantly reduced integration risk. Overall, the economic outlook will influence how much we operate below the prior target. From a funding perspective, end-of-period loan growth exceeded deposit growth. Truist has multiple sources available to fund incremental loan growth, as seen this quarter with the use of brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances and our securities portfolio. I will now provide guidance for full year 2022 and new guidance for the third quarter. In 2022, we now expect adjusted revenue to grow 3.5% to 4.5% from 2021. The mixture of revenue continues to tilt more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower fees, primarily in market-sensitive businesses such as investment banking, mortgage, and wealth. We now expect adjusted non-interest expense to increase 2% to 3% from 2021. This increase in expense outlook largely reflects higher operating losses and intentional investments to support our shift from integrating to operating, including increasing our minimum wage, hiring teammates to support client experience and growth, and ongoing investments in technology. Net-net, this is slightly higher PPNR outlook versus our previously full year guide. In light of our performance during the first half of the year and the benign credit environment, we expect net charge-off ratio to be in the 25 to 35 basis points for the full year. Looking into the third quarter, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow high single-digits in the second quarter level, primarily as a result of higher net interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense. We expect mid-20 basis point increase in our core net interest margin due to the benefits from recent rate hikes and a projected 75 basis point hike in July. We also expect low 20 basis point increase in GAAP net interest margin as a result of core net interest margin expansion, offset by continued declines in purchase accounting accretion. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude.\nBill Rogers: Thanks Daryl. And moving to Slide 17. On our previous earnings call in April, I expressed my belief that the first quarter marked a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Our second quarter results are bearing out this thesis and we're beginning to deliver on the potential of Truist. For businesses that finished conversions in 2021, the increased momentum is palpable. Wealth continues to build momentum in hiring advisers who are attracted to Truist's purpose and broad set of capabilities, both within wealth and across the company through IRM. Wealth net adviser count grew in the second quarter for the first time in 10 quarters. With our recent entry into the Chicago market, Truist Wealth now serves nine of the 10 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. In addition, net organic asset flows have been positive for five straight quarters. In our mortgage business, client satisfaction scores for origination have improved every month since their conversion in August of 2021. The percentage of retail client applications completed digitally is now 97%. For the rest of the company where core bank conversions were completed in the first quarter of 2022, momentum is also building. Loan production in the second quarter was the highest it's been at Truist and up 41% compared to the first quarter. Pipelines also ended the quarter at the highest we've seen. Branch loan production, which is primarily home equity was up 24% relative to the first quarter and the highest it's been at Truist. Consumer deposit production, both in the branches and within digital was up 29% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Retail Banking Net Promoter and client satisfaction scores have rebounded nicely from their March lows and still have more opportunity to improve. Deposit production within our commercial community bank is up 8% relative to the first quarter. PCB-related IRM revenue was up 21% sequentially with increased activity across all products with significant momentum highlighting the power of our advice-driven model. Financially, net interest income and margin rebounded from the first quarter low point, as expected. While fee income did not improve to the extent we had hoped, our second quarter results underscore the importance of our diverse business mix and we believe fees will improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on our significant IRM and revenue synergy opportunities. In addition, merger costs are declining rapidly, and we're making good progress towards realizing our remaining cost saves as we decommission data centers and systems in the back half of the year, all of which will help drive positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. So to conclude on Slide 18, Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our potential, all of which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis. Strategically, our focus has clearly shifted to executional excellence, transformation and growth. We're shifting millions of hours of integration related activity to improving our client experience through investments in digital and technology, simplification of our processes and operations and, of course, by continuing to activate our purpose each and every day. We're also focused on capturing the significant IRM and revenue synergy potential we have, as this is squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients. These shifts and activities do not require incremental risk appetite or capital at only requires execution and focus. At the same time, while we believe the economy is currently healthy, the effects of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with still too high inflation and an aggressive forecast for tightening the monetary policy, have somewhat diminished the economic outlook as we move further into this year and into next. Truist is nevertheless well positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice oriented model for clients, strong absolute and relative markets, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, a strong capital position relative to our risk profile and, most importantly, our power shift from a focus on integration to executional excellence and growth. And with that, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur.\nAnkur Vyas: Thanks, Bill. Jennifer, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nDaryl Bible: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: A couple of questions just on how you're thinking about the funding mix. I know you had several comments in your prepared remarks around accessing some of the pools you have. Could you talk a little bit about what you're doing with deposit pricing for your core deposits, how you're thinking about utilizing brokered from here? And then if you could speak a little bit about the hedge that you put on for protecting earnings against future volatility and where we should expect that to show up in the NIM and how that's going to factor into your outlook for your rate sensitivity? Thanks.\nDaryl Bible: Yes, Betsy. So I would first start with, we were really excited to have really strong broad-based loan growth this quarter, and we expect that to continue, as Bill said in his prepared remarks. To fund that, we're going to start with the runoff of our investment portfolio. We built the investment portfolio when we had all that excess liquidity. We're very comfortable letting that run off and have that -- have a positive mix change on the balance sheet. As far as brokered deposits, we did add some brokered deposits over the last several months. I would say, we're probably at where we want to be from that perspective, knowing that we still have a lot of capacity and other funding sources available in the marketplace. You look at Federal Home Loan Bank advances and negotiable CDs and other amounts, we paid all that off during COVID in 2020 and we have much amount of capacity there. The other thing from an investment portfolio perspective, we're about $145 billion, give or take. And we feel comfortable we could shrink that portfolio probably $20 billion to $25 billion easily and still stay within our liquidity and LCR guidelines that we have to for regulatory purposes. Though, as far as our strategies for pricing, we were really pleased, as Bill talked about, across our company, our deposit betas came in much better than modeled. We modeled 25 for the first 100. And if you look in the second quarter, we came at 15, and that includes brokered. When you back out the brokered, we were only at 8%, which is really, really low. I would say, we will continue to use that strategy. We're going to make sure that we take care of our clients and use the ability to do exception pricing. But I think overall, I think we will continue to hopefully continue to outperform our model expectations.\nBill Rogers: Betsy, one thing I'd add is that, I think, we'll be somewhat stable for deposits for the balance of the year. But remember, as Daryl pointed out, we had just under 2% growth in DDA. So I mean we're adding net new clients and expanding those relationships. And I think the beta really just reflects the benefits of the merger. We're sitting now with just under 20% market share in most of our markets. We've got a business that's highly diversified. Somewhere around 40-plus percent of our deposits are less than $250,000. So we've got a unique franchise here which I think, on the DDA side, continues to benefit and overall stable deposits for the balance of the year.\nBetsy Graseck: And the loan growth\u2026\nDaryl Bible: And your hedge question.\nBill Rogers: Oh, yeah, yeah.\nDaryl Bible: I just \u2013 we are just gradually starting to add some receivers out in the forward markets for the most part out one to two years. Since we are steady on the way up on deposit rates, you won't have as much capacity on the way down. So we're just putting in these forward hedges and protect manages income as rates might potentially fall overall. But we still are asset sensitive though decreasing as rates continue to go up.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then on your point on loan growth, yeah, loan growth was very strong. And I guess the follow-up question here is, what are you hearing from the field with regard to the pace of that loan growth? Is it poised to accelerate, continue at this pace for the foreseeable future? Just a little bit of a sensing color for how we should be thinking about that? Thanks so much.\nBill Rogers: Yeah, Betsy, and that's the question of long-term sustainability. But on the short-term basis and through the balance of this year, if we sort of look on a year-over-year basis, we were sort of in the mid-single figures. I think, we'll be in the higher end of the single figures in terms of loan growth. Our teams are excited. Our production numbers, which I highlighted, are up significantly. Our pipelines are up. So we're \u2013 I think we're seeing a little bit of maybe idiosyncratic to us, and our shift to integration in terms of prowess on the loan side. And the great news is that, it is extremely broad-based. So not only is it in the C&I side, but our core branch network, I mean, their applications are up, personal loans are up, HELOC\u2019s are up. So similarly, they're starting to execute at a much higher level.\nBetsy Graseck: Yeah.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Yes. Good morning. Sorry about that. Yeah, as a follow-up on the fee side, you had great insurance revenue this quarter, up 13%. We heard your comments about some of the challenges looking out on some of the other lines. So can you just kind of help us walk through just what you're expecting on the fee income side, inside that third quarter PPNR outlook that you gave, because I think you talked mostly just about higher NII and higher expenses. So any granularity on the fee side would be great? Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. Hey, Ken. Let me \u2013 let me maybe just do a walk through of the broad categories. I think sort of overall, I'd say, fee income stable relative to the first half, and maybe let me give you some puts and takes against that. Insurance, as you noted, solid organic growth that will offset some of that seasonality. So I feel really good about the momentum that we have there. And as we mentioned earlier, we're continuing to invest in the insurance business. So we feel good about the growth there. Mortgage, some puts and takes. Origination probably a little bit offset by servicing. Gain of sales, probably a little bit of a wildcard there in terms of whether we see some rebound on that side as some of the capacity comes out, but mortgage probably a little flat second half of the year to the first half of the year. Wealth probably be a little bit down in the third quarter, just sort of where markets are right now. But as I highlighted earlier, our \u2013 really solid production and asset flows and hiring net advisers, so if we get a little market tailwind that could change. Investment banking, I think we expect the second half to be better than the first. Pipelines continue to be really solid. And then we've got a bit of things that are unique to us. We've got this really good IRM momentum from our commercial community bank, that's probably a little bit less market dependent. I'd, sort of, call that more sort of bread and butter kind of investment banking business. And then we've added bankers there also and we're continuing to invest. So we're leaning in there. And then on the service charge side, with the decisions we've made with Truist One and overdraft decisions that will be down. So sort of net-net, that's, I think, a good walk through on the fee income side.\nKen Usdin: Great, okay. And then second question just on, you had talked about operating lower CET1 than your 9.75%. We saw a 9.2% this quarter. And just what you're thinking, you saw you did a little buyback, just in terms of capital allocation decisions and potential for more of those insurance deals that you guys have been biased towards over time? Thanks Bill.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. So I mean, the really great news is we're using capital exactly where we want to right now, so we're using it with growth. So we've been funding the loan growth. As we've talked about, our capital levels were driven by merger risk, CCAR results and economic uncertainty. I think merger risk is largely behind us. Very pleased with the CCAR results, our low risk profile, better PPNR profile. Economic uncertainty, it was really high during the pandemic, moderated and maybe increasing a little bit. So we've got to balance all of those. But we're comfortable where we are. We've had more organic growth. We do see more opportunity in some of the non-bank M&A, as you noted. So we're going to allow capacity and be opportunistic there as well. And then we generate -- post merger, we'll generate somewhere around 25 basis points of capital a quarter organically. If you say, okay, we will use about 15 basis points of that to fund the current growth that we have and anticipate, we've got about 10 basis points net. So I think that gives us the requisite flexibility to fund the growth that we anticipate; be flexible, as you noted, for potential non-bank M&A, particularly on the insurance side. And so if you add all that, share repurchase probably is not our top priority at this particular juncture.\nKen Usdin: Thanks for all that, Bill.\nBill Rogers: All right. Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Daryl.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nDaryl Bible: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Bill, can you share with us, you obviously put together a very good quarter this quarter and you put some very strong numbers in your comments at the very end of the prepared remarks about growth. But then you've cautioned it, of course, with what's going on at the macro scene, with monetary policy and such. Can you share with us what you're seeing from your customers because there seems to be a disconnect. A lot of investors are very concerned about credit deterioration. You certainly don't see it, nor do your peers. But is there something on the horizon other than the macro that you guys are seeing, or what are your early indicators you're looking at to see if there will be a crack in credit maybe in six or 12 months?\nBill Rogers: Yeah. I mean, sort of, going down the categories of that question, our clients still see a lot of good demand. I may be a little bit clouded by the fact the last two markets I was in were South Florida and Nashville and you know, there's -- they are blowing and going in virtually every direction. But our clients continue to see good demand. I think it's appropriate to put a cautious note just because I think you have to. And if we look at sort of what are the canaries in the coal mine, so to speak, what are the things that we're trying to look at, and while we don't see a deterioration, I think the things you look at are things like what's happening in the broadly syndicated sponsor-backed leverage deals. So we sort of look at that market, spreads gapped out pretty significantly. Things happening in CRE. We've seen some non-recourse construction loans and some things that you sort of pause a little bit on. Some potential FICO drift and willingness to repay given some of the stimulus. Will things happen in mortgage as some of the Care Act relief comes off? Now all those things that are there, we're not seeing in our results right now, but they are things that we're looking at and that we're stressing and trying to pay attention to. So I think just we're bankers, so we should be conservative. That's the world we live in and we try to manage for all outcomes. But sitting here today, looking at the hood of the car, demand looks pretty good and our business looks pretty good and our clients are extremely healthy.\nGerard Cassidy: No, that's very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, Daryl, you mentioned the deposit beta, it came in better than expected. I think you said without the brokered deposits, it came in around 8 basis points. I think you guys were modeling for something closer to 25. Can you share with us, what drove the better-than-expected number? And second, as the Fed goes another 75, assuming they do in July and then obviously further rate increases later this year, could the modeling work against you? Meaning could the betas actually go faster later in the year because rates are moving up so quickly?\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So Gerard, I would just tell you that I think it was a lot of great work with our teammates. We're working with clients and giving what we thought was appropriate. Most of our clients aren't there just for rate because we have other products and services. They really like to bank with us for those reasons. So they aren't as rate-sensitive as other clients might be in other places. So I think that's really the benefit of our franchise. I do agree with you though, as interest rates go up, our deposit betas will continue to climb just because more and more people will get a little bit more asset-sensitive. In the prepared remarks, I did say that our cumulative beta would move from 15% to 25% in the second to third quarter on a cumulative basis. We would still expect it to go on if the Fed continues to raise interest rates that you continue to see Fed cumulative beta increasing. And probably if you look at from second quarter to fourth quarter, we may be in the low 30s, give or take a couple of percentage points there. So overall, if you go back to where we were during the Great Recession, much better overall performance than what we had a few of our banks were combined back then. So I think right now, I think we feel very good. And I think that you're going to see really positive growth in our net interest income because of that.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. I just want to follow up on the expense guide. Obviously, overall, the PPNR guide is higher, but the expenses have been an area of focus, I think, for the company since the merger. And I did just want to kind of follow up on what's driving the tweak up by roughly 1% on expenses, especially since the fees are coming in a little bit weaker and net interest income tends not to have a lot of fees or a lot of expenses related to it.  And then just as we think about the follow-up with the confidence that you can control expenses kind of next year without the benefit of this kind of merger and other merger-related costs that will be done this year?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Matt, this is Bill. No eye off the ball on expenses, I can assure you that. So, the competencies that we've built through the merger to manage expenses, understand expenses, create continued improvements are all still there and will be a big part of our expense story for this year and for the years going forward. And a big part of our capability to deliver positive operating leverage and I think industry-leading efficiency ratio. So, no lack of focus on the expense side. And we have lots of things underway in terms of, how we would achieve those additional opportunities.  But on the same side, we're going to -- we're investing in our business. And just like we've seen some of this momentum we've talked about, particularly coming from the first quarter into this quarter, we don't want to miss those opportunities. And those opportunities don't line up quarter-to-quarter. They \u2013 I think they line up well. We have confidence in the investments we've made in talent and insurance, wealth, investment banking, care centers, as an example, improved revenue potential, improve the client experience.  And we have a pretty good formula for long-term paybacks on those investments. I mean, we've been at this and have a pretty good understanding of that. Also, the investments in our teammates for the minimum wage. So that was -- that's a clear step up. I think in fairness, that overtime others will be in that same position. But we just felt like, as I mentioned earlier, it was important for us to lead. This is a time when those teammates need us most. I think it will really help us long term in terms of retention and acquisition of key talent. So, it also has an immediate bump-up and a longer-term payback, which I feel really good about.  And then the one that's just trickier and a little more quarter and year-end specific is just the increase in operating losses and they are up. They're up higher than we think they should be. We have a lot of things in place to do that. We made some decisions related to the client experience that I think increased some of those operating losses. But I'm confident that they'll normalize overtime given the investments we're making in that part.  But that's the only part that I would say is the non-investment part of the increase in the expense side and I think we'll be more positive about that long term and normalizing those expenses.\nMatt O'Connor: And what exactly are those operating losses? Maybe you can give an example or two? And is any of that related to the deal conversion and any follow-up from that, to be blunt? Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Yes. I mean there are decisions we made relative to client experience. I'll give you an example of. On the fraud side is, giving the client the benefit of the doubt upfront. So, if a client has an experience, we're going to get the money back from another bank and what we're doing is go ahead and funding that client now. That has a one-time increase. But over time, that normalizes, just as an example. And we think that's a good client experience and something, again, that will normalize over time. It's just one example.\nDaryl Bible: You also asked for containment of expenses on a go-forward basis. As we look to rationalize and get back to business as usual, I think there's still opportunities in our corporate real estate portfolio. I think as we continue to rationalize our branch network on closure of some branches over time just as behaviors change with our clients. I think we've talked about this before, but we still have a lot of initiatives that our teammates came up with that would help us from both the cost savings as well as revenue and client experience perspective, and we're in the midst of implementing those over the next 12 to 18 months. We also are moving towards a new card platform over the next year or two, which would generate some savings once we both combine to that. From a technology perspective, we are starting to put more applications up into the cloud which, over time, we're also generating some savings. And last thing I just want to mention is, as you look at our operations, both front and back office, the digitization and artificial intelligence projects that are rolling out, all part and very important to how the company runs and operates. It gives us comfort that our expenses will be contained over the next year or two.\nMatt O'Connor: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Well, Bill, you gave me the opening, you talked about the hood of the car, so I'll go with the Corvette analogy again. And it looks like -- on the positive, it looks like you're going from first to second gear, right? You said end-of-period loans are up 5%, that's accelerating. You're beating on deposit beta. Your NIM is up, you expect it to be up maybe in the range of 25 basis points next quarter. NII is going higher. And you still have the decommissioning of the data centers and all the apps later this year, so that should help. So, next second year, fantastic. But then I look at the speed that you're going and it doesn't seem to be a lot faster. Yes, PPNR guidance, a little bit higher. But you're guiding for 50 basis points plus operating leverage for this year, if you took the aero [ph] part of your bands. And some of your peers are 200, 300, 400 basis points. I think last quarter, that difference was 100 basis points. So, in a way, the operating leverage is a little bit less than I think what you were guiding in the first quarter. And I hear you, you're not taking your eye off the ball on expenses. You're investing in minimum wage. You have some operating losses. But still, it just seems like the power of the Corvette is still not being fully realized. So, where are you in that progression of translating the power of the engine to the power of the growth and the power of the operating leverage because your efficiency ratio is not really in the ZIP code of the initial figures you gave when you announced the merger three and a half years ago. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Yes. A couple of things, Mike. So, I appreciate the acknowledgment of second gear at least. I don't know how many gears your Corvette has, but at least there's an acknowledgment of the second gear. And I think we are seeing that -- we are seeing that growth. And I feel really good about the migration from the first to the second quarter. If loan growth is one of those indicators, but I don't think it's always the indicator, but if I look at production and pipelines and just the things that we're doing, and it's broad-based, so it's not one thing, it's the whole engine operating at a faster pace. But if we're going to continue to just grind on the corvette thing, you got to put gas in it. And you got to put -- and gas is more expensive. We want to drive it faster. And we're really confident in the things that we're investing in and the capability of the company long-term. As it relates to the efficiency ratio from the first guidance, I mean, remember that was in an interest rate environment that was pretty different than where we are now. I still believe, and we're delivering and prospectively will deliver industry-leading efficiency ratio with growth. Whether it's at 55 or low 50s, I don't know, but I am confident that it will be industry-leading in any different -- in any rate environment. So I feel good about that. And then we've got market sensitive businesses that are sitting on the launching pad and really good capability to grow significantly if we get a little bit of tailwind. And that tailwind could come in the fourth quarter, it could come next year, but it's going to come, and we're better positioned than we've ever been to capitalize on those opportunities.\nMike Mayo : I guess what my question is getting to, perhaps some of the other questions, and I know I'm not going to get an answer, but you can give it qualitatively. Looking out at 2023, when you finally have all the merger savings in your numbers and when you finally have realized some of these -- some of the noisy financial items such as the operating losses and you finally are done with these one-off charges, which are going down, what sort of operating leverage we can expect next year? At least if you can answer that qualitatively or if you want to put numbers around it, we'd love it.\nBill Rogers : Yes. Qualitatively, it's got to be qualitatively, we just don't know what the rate environment is going to be. So qualitatively, it will be positive. That's the angle that we're gaining towards and committed to. But similarly, and I think, again, you're seeing it this quarter, with revenue growth that reflects the power of this franchise and an efficient expense model that supports that.\nMike Mayo : All right. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian: Yes. Hi. I -- just to follow-up on the corvette analogy. You are driving this car and in theory the roads are getting worse, right? So maybe the first question I have is, in the last crisis, both companies did fairly well, relatively well from a credit perspective. And Daryl, as you think about the different scenarios for ACL buildup in a downturn, a lot of investors are comfortable thinking about where the banking industry could be in a charge-offs scenario, but none of us can limit the CECL process, right? So I guess the question is, in a mild recession scenario, how much more ACL build do you think would be ahead of you for what the charge-offs that you think your portfolio would produce?\nDaryl Bible: Hey, Erika, I'll start and Clarke can help finish me off on this. But when we set the amounts, obviously, it's scenario-based. It's always forward-looking from that perspective. In the prepared remarks, we did say that there is potential that the scenarios can continue to deteriorate. If that is the case, then you would expect us to continue to add to our allowance. And that would add to our provision costs as that moves up from that perspective. But right now, we aren't seeing a whole lot. And there could be some deterioration from that perspective, but let me kick it back over to Clarke.\nClarke Starnes: Yes, Erika, I would just say this, and Bill mentioned it and Daryl earlier, as we came through the quarter, we refreshed all of our scenarios. So our baseline, which is 40% of our estimate, is a more pessimistic outlook, slower economy. And then, we have a 30% weight on a recessionary, a more pessimistic scenario. So we feel like we've been pretty conservative in our estimate this quarter. And also this quarter, we had really good loan growth and very highly rated credits. So those carry a lower relative reserve rate. So that's why you didn't see a big build this quarter. You saw 6 basis points decline in our allowance. That was because of the growth. So we believe we've accounted for some of the recessionary risk right now. And so, as we look forward, the main driver of changing the allowance would be growth. Unless the scenarios get more severe, and then obviously, our reserve rate would have to change.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you for taking my question.\nAnkur Vyas: Jennifer, we\u2019ve got time for one more question.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. Just on the -- also on the credit front, can you just talk about, are you seeing any emerging signs of stress within the portfolio, particularly as you look at some of the lower-end consumer, maybe in your regional acceptance business on the non-prime side or the Sheffield business? If you can just talk about where, if any, that you're seeing some of the cracks form. Thanks.\nBeau Cummins: Look, I mean, we are monitoring that very carefully. So I think what we're seeing probably a little bit of indication would be the low to moderate income consumer, think cohorts $50,000 incomes and below. We're seeing higher delinquent -- early delinquency in those areas. But it's not translated yet into higher late-stage delinquencies or losses. So, for example, in our subprime auto business, we had one of our lower loss rates this quarter seasonally and we're seeing things slightly because of the Manheim being up, consumers higher redemption rates even on repo. So it's not yet translated into any losses. We've also looked at our deposit levels or our consumer borrowers and they're not coming down rapidly, particularly for the moderate income and above. So while there's early signs we're watching, it's not translated into any significant concerns. And our outlook right now for the rest of the year does not assume any significant deterioration.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay. And then just separately on the loan growth side, I know you indicated that you did see some pressure there this quarter on commercial real estate, but you seem a bit more optimistic there in stabilization. How should we think about the growth in that portfolio? Is there the potential for incremental declines there, or do you think stabilization will happen beginning next quarter? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yes. I'm sure it's quarter-to-quarter, but I think we're stabilizing, is the way I would say it, and into more of a growth mode. And by the way, we feel really comfortable about it. We've made decisions through the cycle that create a really good portfolio. We've done a lot of things internally strategically to get really, really strong alignment around the type of CRE portfolio we want, the diversity that we want. So probably somewhere in the next couple of quarters, stabilizing with the -- bent for growth over time.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. All right. Thanks, Bill.\nAnkur Vyas: Thanks, John, and thanks, everybody. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Jennifer, you can now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning. Trust delivered a good second quarter, reflecting our improving momentum after the integration and the resiliency of our diverse business mix in a volatile market environment. Our financial results modestly exceeded the guidance we provided in April with several puts and takes. Loan growth was strong and broad-based. Net interest margin expanded significantly due to higher interest rates in our strong deposit franchise. Credit quality remains excellent and we are pleased by our relative and absolute performance in the recent stress test. In light of these results, our Board will consider a resolution to increase the common dividend by 8% at its July meeting. This quarter's performance, combined with improving client experience trends and dramatically lower merger costs, reflects the initial benefits of our shift from integrating to operating. While there's still work to do, such as stemming elevated operational losses, closing out residual integration issues and completing our decommissioning process, I am very confident in Truist's trajectory and reaffirm our commitment to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year of 2022. I'm going to share some more details on those topics in a moment. Then going to Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is fundamentally a deep, purpose-led company dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities. We know that our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose drives performance and defines how we do business every day. It very intentionally begins with the word Inspire, and to be inspirational, it's often necessary to be bold and to be first. I'll highlight four examples that I think reflect that purpose on the next slide. First and foremost, we recently announced that we're making a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 an hour effective October 1. This increase will benefit approximately 14,000 teammates, about 80% of whom will have client-facing roles in a retail and small business banking business. Purposeful growth is dependent on attracting and retaining the best talent. In addition to our industry-leading benefits, we designed a compensation program that also helps teammates who needed most who want the impact of inflation in their daily lives. Second, we had a historic launch of Truist One Banking yesterday. This is our new differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking, including two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. The flagship Truist One checking account has zero overdraft fees and the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple $100 negative balance buffer. We also introduced the Truist Confidence Account, which provides consumers with access to main street banking services and no overdraft fees. We're mindful of the impact that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on some of our clients, and Truist One is one of many examples of how we're advancing financial inclusion across our communities. Third, Truist committed $120 million to strengthen and support diverse and small businesses. This commitment exemplifies our purpose by supporting small businesses, which are so vital to the health and vibrancy of our communities. And fourth, we released our 2021 ESG and CSR report in early June. At Truist, we view all the elements of ESG as an opportunity to improve our company and to put our purpose into action, and that includes climate change. As we look to externalize our own net zero aspirations and further the transition to a lower carbon economy, we recently created new advisory practices within our CIB and commercial community bank to help our clients make their own transition. We're pleased with how our clients have welcomed and embraced our advice and expertise around ESG as it underscores the possibilities in viewing ESG as an opportunity for growth. Now turning to Slide 7. Consistent with our previous guidance, merger-related costs totaled $238 million, roughly half of what they were in the first quarter. We expect merger costs to decrease significantly in the back half of 2022 before going away entirely in 2023. This trajectory should be welcome news to shareholders as diminishing merger costs correspond to a less complex narrative, improving earnings quality, more capital and, ultimately, industry-leading returns. Lastly, we incurred a $39 million pre-tax gain related to the early extinguishment of $800 million in FHLB debt. Turning to our second quarter performance highlights on the next slide. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.09 a share on a reported basis. Excluding the selected items on Slide 7, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $1.20 a share, down 23% compared to a year ago, primarily due to a sizable reserve release in the prior quarter. Relative to the first quarter, adjusted EPS decreased 2% as higher loan loss provision offset a 10% increase in adjusted PPNR. Adjusted revenue benefited from higher short-term rates alongside well-controlled deposit costs, strong loan growth, consumer seasonality and strong insurance results, partially offset by continued softness in market-sensitive fee businesses such as investment banking, wealth and mortgage. Adjusted ROTCE was 25%, up from 23% in the prior three quarters, even when normalizing things like AOCI to zero and assuming a flat ALLL ratio, adjusted ROTCE was a strong 17%. Adjusted expenses increased 3.8%, reflecting higher insurance-related incentive compensation and intentional investments in talent and technology to support our shift from integrating to operating. Other expenses also increased due to normalization of teammate travel and elevated operational losses. We have planned products, processes and technology enhancements underway to reduce these losses and enhance the overall client experience, including the launch of innovative authentication approaches later this quarter. While operating leverage was a negative 200 basis points year-to-date, this primarily reflects the $435 million year-to-date headwind we have from PPP and PAA revenue. Despite these headwinds, we're still targeting positive operating leverage on both a GAAP and adjusted basis for the full year. Asset quality remains excellent and net charge-offs decreased relative to the first quarter. Capital deployment was healthy in the second quarter as we funded strong loan growth and completed $150 million worth of share repurchases. Capital levels remain strong in light of our risk and profitability profile, demonstrated by our continued strong performance in the 2022 CCAR process. Overall, the second quarter begins to reflect the power of Truist post integration. Now turning to Slide 9. Digital activity increased in the second quarter, attributable to seasonality and nearly 200 enhancements we implemented across the platform, representing a significantly higher pace of value delivery for our clients. Our ability to rapidly incorporate client feedback reflects the capabilities of a more modern and agile digital platform and has resulted in improved client satisfaction scores, which have risen consistently since our initial introduction of Truist Digital in waves in 2021. In June, we announced the grand opening of our state-of-the-art Innovation and Technology Center located within our headquarters, the ITC provides an environment conducive to reimagining the client experience such as by facilitating new ways of working with Agile teams to better collaborate with clients to co-create dynamic and marketable cross-channel services. The new space features client journey rooms, a maker space for building, testing and refining new products and services; a reality lab, where we can utilize virtual and augmented reality technology; and a contact center incubator where we can collect and respond to real-time feedback directly from our clients. I'm personally excited about our improved ability to aid our teammates as they reimagine how we serve clients. We also acquired San Francisco-based Long Game, the award-winning gamification app that utilizes behavioral economics, price link savings and mobile gaming to motivate positive financial behaviors and drive new account growth and client retention. By leveraging Long Game's innovative technology, Truist can empower our clients to build long-term financial wellness. I'm also pleased to report that our merger integration activities are now complete. Our final merger release was rolled out in May and we recently held our last merger Oversight Committee meeting. As we shift to BAU, our digital and technology teams are looking forward to accelerating our pace of innovation and client experience improvements. Yesterday, as I mentioned, we introduced Truist One. And as I referenced earlier -- as I referenced earlier, we will soon expand LightStream to include a new deposit product on a real-time, cloud-based core, enhance the sophistication of our underwriting models through a partnership with Zest; roll out Truist Assist, our virtual assistant to millions of clients, just to name a few examples. Overall, we're increasingly optimistic about the performance and the potential of our increased investment and focus on digital and technology. Now turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Average loan balances increased a very robust $8.1 billion or 2.8% sequentially with growth across most businesses. The pace of growth accelerated during the quarter with end-of-period loans up 4.7%. Growth was primarily driven by C&I, where average balances increased $6.7 billion or 4.8% overall. We delivered broad-based loan growth across most CIB industry verticals, notably energy, consumer and retail, financial institutions, TMT. Due to M&A activity, the current shift to banks from the bond market increased relevance with new and existing clients and a higher revolver usage for CapEx, inventories and inflation. As in recent quarters, growth continues to be strong within our Asset Finance group as we continue to build out that business with more talent, product capabilities and a larger balance sheet. Commercial Community Bank C&I balances increased 2%, excluding PPP and dealer floor plan, reflecting growth across all our geographic regions and was the second strongest end of period growth since 2019. Revolver utilization increased 300 basis points to just over 30%, the highest level since mid 2020. CRE remains a headwind, reflecting both the highly competitive market and our disciplined approach. At the same time though, I continue to be optimistic about the future of our CRE business as we create a more strategic \u2013 as we create more strategic clarity internally and non-bank competition rationalizes somewhat with rising rates. Wealth lending was up $600 million sequentially as our advisers and clients continue to benefit from the combined capabilities of both heritage firms. Residential mortgage increased 2.6%, reflecting ongoing correspondent purchases and slower prepayment fees. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances increased $1 billion or 1.3% as strong growth in Service Finance, Prime Auto, Sheffield and LightStream more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios. Service Finance is performing in line with our high expectations and experiencing good business development momentum given the alignment with Truist. Second quarter production by Service Finance was about double the volume loss and double the profitability from our terminated partnerships. Our prime auto business is also back on its front foot after regaining some momentum it lost following its own fourth quarter conversion. In addition, our consumer finance businesses continue to advance their automated decision capabilities which ultimately improves consistency, efficiency and creates better client experiences. Overall, clients are generally positive on current economic conditions and demand in their businesses. At the same time, concerns about labor shortages and margin pressure, given rising rates and higher input costs, are growing, creating the potential for more defensive postures. Truist is well positioned to advise clients across a range of scenarios given our broad capabilities and talented teammates. Given all of this, we remain generally positive about our prospects for continued loan growth, particularly taking into account our post-integration momentum. At the same time, we have to acknowledge the increased uncertainty associated with the softening economic environment, which may cause loan growth to deviate from this outlook. Turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposit balances increased $8.5 billion or 2% during the second quarter, largely attributable to an increase in brokered deposits in mid-March. Excluding brokered deposits, average deposits decreased $2.9 billion or 0.7%. Deposit costs were very well controlled, reflecting Truist's strong retail and commercial oriented franchise and our enviable market share position. In addition, our lines of business and corporate treasury teams delivered excellent execution against a thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. As a result, interest-bearing client deposit betas were 8%, well below our modeled assumptions. As the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid, particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding. And now let me turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail. Thanks Daryl. And moving to Slide 17. On our previous earnings call in April, I expressed my belief that the first quarter marked a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Our second quarter results are bearing out this thesis and we're beginning to deliver on the potential of Truist. For businesses that finished conversions in 2021, the increased momentum is palpable. Wealth continues to build momentum in hiring advisers who are attracted to Truist's purpose and broad set of capabilities, both within wealth and across the company through IRM. Wealth net adviser count grew in the second quarter for the first time in 10 quarters. With our recent entry into the Chicago market, Truist Wealth now serves nine of the 10 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. In addition, net organic asset flows have been positive for five straight quarters. In our mortgage business, client satisfaction scores for origination have improved every month since their conversion in August of 2021. The percentage of retail client applications completed digitally is now 97%. For the rest of the company where core bank conversions were completed in the first quarter of 2022, momentum is also building. Loan production in the second quarter was the highest it's been at Truist and up 41% compared to the first quarter. Pipelines also ended the quarter at the highest we've seen. Branch loan production, which is primarily home equity was up 24% relative to the first quarter and the highest it's been at Truist. Consumer deposit production, both in the branches and within digital was up 29% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Retail Banking Net Promoter and client satisfaction scores have rebounded nicely from their March lows and still have more opportunity to improve. Deposit production within our commercial community bank is up 8% relative to the first quarter. PCB-related IRM revenue was up 21% sequentially with increased activity across all products with significant momentum highlighting the power of our advice-driven model. Financially, net interest income and margin rebounded from the first quarter low point, as expected. While fee income did not improve to the extent we had hoped, our second quarter results underscore the importance of our diverse business mix and we believe fees will improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on our significant IRM and revenue synergy opportunities. In addition, merger costs are declining rapidly, and we're making good progress towards realizing our remaining cost saves as we decommission data centers and systems in the back half of the year, all of which will help drive positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. So to conclude on Slide 18, Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our potential, all of which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis. Strategically, our focus has clearly shifted to executional excellence, transformation and growth. We're shifting millions of hours of integration related activity to improving our client experience through investments in digital and technology, simplification of our processes and operations and, of course, by continuing to activate our purpose each and every day. We're also focused on capturing the significant IRM and revenue synergy potential we have, as this is squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients. These shifts and activities do not require incremental risk appetite or capital at only requires execution and focus. At the same time, while we believe the economy is currently healthy, the effects of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with still too high inflation and an aggressive forecast for tightening the monetary policy, have somewhat diminished the economic outlook as we move further into this year and into next. Truist is nevertheless well positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice oriented model for clients, strong absolute and relative markets, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, a strong capital position relative to our risk profile and, most importantly, our power shift from a focus on integration to executional excellence and growth. And with that, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur. Good morning. Betsy, one thing I'd add is that, I think, we'll be somewhat stable for deposits for the balance of the year. But remember, as Daryl pointed out, we had just under 2% growth in DDA. So I mean we're adding net new clients and expanding those relationships. And I think the beta really just reflects the benefits of the merger. We're sitting now with just under 20% market share in most of our markets. We've got a business that's highly diversified. Somewhere around 40-plus percent of our deposits are less than $250,000. So we've got a unique franchise here which I think, on the DDA side, continues to benefit and overall stable deposits for the balance of the year. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Betsy, and that's the question of long-term sustainability. But on the short-term basis and through the balance of this year, if we sort of look on a year-over-year basis, we were sort of in the mid-single figures. I think, we'll be in the higher end of the single figures in terms of loan growth. Our teams are excited. Our production numbers, which I highlighted, are up significantly. Our pipelines are up. So we're \u2013 I think we're seeing a little bit of maybe idiosyncratic to us, and our shift to integration in terms of prowess on the loan side. And the great news is that, it is extremely broad-based. So not only is it in the C&I side, but our core branch network, I mean, their applications are up, personal loans are up, HELOC's are up. So similarly, they're starting to execute at a much higher level. Yeah. Hey, Ken. Let me \u2013 let me maybe just do a walk through of the broad categories. I think sort of overall, I'd say, fee income stable relative to the first half, and maybe let me give you some puts and takes against that. Insurance, as you noted, solid organic growth that will offset some of that seasonality. So I feel really good about the momentum that we have there. And as we mentioned earlier, we're continuing to invest in the insurance business. So we feel good about the growth there. Mortgage, some puts and takes. Origination probably a little bit offset by servicing. Gain of sales, probably a little bit of a wildcard there in terms of whether we see some rebound on that side as some of the capacity comes out, but mortgage probably a little flat second half of the year to the first half of the year. Wealth probably be a little bit down in the third quarter, just sort of where markets are right now. But as I highlighted earlier, our \u2013 really solid production and asset flows and hiring net advisers, so if we get a little market tailwind that could change. Investment banking, I think we expect the second half to be better than the first. Pipelines continue to be really solid. And then we've got a bit of things that are unique to us. We've got this really good IRM momentum from our commercial community bank, that's probably a little bit less market dependent. I'd, sort of, call that more sort of bread and butter kind of investment banking business. And then we've added bankers there also and we're continuing to invest. So we're leaning in there. And then on the service charge side, with the decisions we've made with Truist One and overdraft decisions that will be down. So sort of net-net, that's, I think, a good walk through on the fee income side. Yeah. So I mean, the really great news is we're using capital exactly where we want to right now, so we're using it with growth. So we've been funding the loan growth. As we've talked about, our capital levels were driven by merger risk, CCAR results and economic uncertainty. I think merger risk is largely behind us. Very pleased with the CCAR results, our low risk profile, better PPNR profile. Economic uncertainty, it was really high during the pandemic, moderated and maybe increasing a little bit. So we've got to balance all of those. But we're comfortable where we are. We've had more organic growth. We do see more opportunity in some of the non-bank M&A, as you noted. So we're going to allow capacity and be opportunistic there as well. And then we generate -- post merger, we'll generate somewhere around 25 basis points of capital a quarter organically. If you say, okay, we will use about 15 basis points of that to fund the current growth that we have and anticipate, we've got about 10 basis points net. So I think that gives us the requisite flexibility to fund the growth that we anticipate; be flexible, as you noted, for potential non-bank M&A, particularly on the insurance side. And so if you add all that, share repurchase probably is not our top priority at this particular juncture. All right. Sure. Good morning. Yeah. I mean, sort of, going down the categories of that question, our clients still see a lot of good demand. I may be a little bit clouded by the fact the last two markets I was in were South Florida and Nashville and you know, there's -- they are blowing and going in virtually every direction. But our clients continue to see good demand. I think it's appropriate to put a cautious note just because I think you have to. And if we look at sort of what are the canaries in the coal mine, so to speak, what are the things that we're trying to look at, and while we don't see a deterioration, I think the things you look at are things like what's happening in the broadly syndicated sponsor-backed leverage deals. So we sort of look at that market, spreads gapped out pretty significantly. Things happening in CRE. We've seen some non-recourse construction loans and some things that you sort of pause a little bit on. Some potential FICO drift and willingness to repay given some of the stimulus. Will things happen in mortgage as some of the Care Act relief comes off? Now all those things that are there, we're not seeing in our results right now, but they are things that we're looking at and that we're stressing and trying to pay attention to. So I think just we're bankers, so we should be conservative. That's the world we live in and we try to manage for all outcomes. But sitting here today, looking at the hood of the car, demand looks pretty good and our business looks pretty good and our clients are extremely healthy. Yes. Matt, this is Bill. No eye off the ball on expenses, I can assure you that. So, the competencies that we've built through the merger to manage expenses, understand expenses, create continued improvements are all still there and will be a big part of our expense story for this year and for the years going forward. And a big part of our capability to deliver positive operating leverage and I think industry-leading efficiency ratio. So, no lack of focus on the expense side. And we have lots of things underway in terms of, how we would achieve those additional opportunities.  But on the same side, we're going to -- we're investing in our business. And just like we've seen some of this momentum we've talked about, particularly coming from the first quarter into this quarter, we don't want to miss those opportunities. And those opportunities don't line up quarter-to-quarter. They \u2013 I think they line up well. We have confidence in the investments we've made in talent and insurance, wealth, investment banking, care centers, as an example, improved revenue potential, improve the client experience.  And we have a pretty good formula for long-term paybacks on those investments. I mean, we've been at this and have a pretty good understanding of that. Also, the investments in our teammates for the minimum wage. So that was -- that's a clear step up. I think in fairness, that overtime others will be in that same position. But we just felt like, as I mentioned earlier, it was important for us to lead. This is a time when those teammates need us most. I think it will really help us long term in terms of retention and acquisition of key talent. So, it also has an immediate bump-up and a longer-term payback, which I feel really good about.  And then the one that's just trickier and a little more quarter and year-end specific is just the increase in operating losses and they are up. They're up higher than we think they should be. We have a lot of things in place to do that. We made some decisions related to the client experience that I think increased some of those operating losses. But I'm confident that they'll normalize overtime given the investments we're making in that part.  But that's the only part that I would say is the non-investment part of the increase in the expense side and I think we'll be more positive about that long term and normalizing those expenses. Yes. I mean there are decisions we made relative to client experience. I'll give you an example of. On the fraud side is, giving the client the benefit of the doubt upfront. So, if a client has an experience, we're going to get the money back from another bank and what we're doing is go ahead and funding that client now. That has a one-time increase. But over time, that normalizes, just as an example. And we think that's a good client experience and something, again, that will normalize over time. It's just one example. Yes. A couple of things, Mike. So, I appreciate the acknowledgment of second gear at least. I don't know how many gears your Corvette has, but at least there's an acknowledgment of the second gear. And I think we are seeing that -- we are seeing that growth. And I feel really good about the migration from the first to the second quarter. If loan growth is one of those indicators, but I don't think it's always the indicator, but if I look at production and pipelines and just the things that we're doing, and it's broad-based, so it's not one thing, it's the whole engine operating at a faster pace. But if we're going to continue to just grind on the corvette thing, you got to put gas in it. And you got to put -- and gas is more expensive. We want to drive it faster. And we're really confident in the things that we're investing in and the capability of the company long-term. As it relates to the efficiency ratio from the first guidance, I mean, remember that was in an interest rate environment that was pretty different than where we are now. I still believe, and we're delivering and prospectively will deliver industry-leading efficiency ratio with growth. Whether it's at 55 or low 50s, I don't know, but I am confident that it will be industry-leading in any different -- in any rate environment. So I feel good about that. And then we've got market sensitive businesses that are sitting on the launching pad and really good capability to grow significantly if we get a little bit of tailwind. And that tailwind could come in the fourth quarter, it could come next year, but it's going to come, and we're better positioned than we've ever been to capitalize on those opportunities. Yes. Qualitatively, it's got to be qualitatively, we just don't know what the rate environment is going to be. So qualitatively, it will be positive. That's the angle that we're gaining towards and committed to. But similarly, and I think, again, you're seeing it this quarter, with revenue growth that reflects the power of this franchise and an efficient expense model that supports that. Yes. I'm sure it's quarter-to-quarter, but I think we're stabilizing, is the way I would say it, and into more of a growth mode. And by the way, we feel really comfortable about it. We've made decisions through the cycle that create a really good portfolio. We've done a lot of things internally strategically to get really, really strong alignment around the type of CRE portfolio we want, the diversity that we want. So probably somewhere in the next couple of quarters, stabilizing with the -- bent for growth over time."

            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income increased 7% sequentially, driven by higher short-term interest rates alongside limited deposit betas in addition to strong loan growth. We also saw a positive asset mix shift with the investment portfolio shrinking and funding strong loan growth. As Bill indicated, the strong quality of our deposit franchise also limited deposit rate repricing. Reported net interest margin increased 13 basis points and core net interest margin increased 15 basis points. Net interest margin and net interest income increased for similar reasons and exceeded the high end of our April guidance, primarily due to our teammates delivering lower than modeled deposit betas. Overall, we continue to take a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk. We continue to be asset sensitive and that will decrease over time with the diminishing benefit associated with future rate increases and the disintermediation of funding sources. We forecasted an approximate 25% cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta through the second and third quarters. To protect against any potential downside in rates, we also added $16 billion of swaps, which are primarily forward starting. These swaps begin in 2023 and 2024 and will have laddered maturities that range from three to five years to minimize earnings volatility. Moving to Slide 13. Fee income increased $106 million or 4.9% sequentially. Insurance income increased $98 million due to the seasonality, strong organic growth and the full quarter of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. Car and payment-related fees increased $34 million, reflecting the prior quarter acquisition of merchant relationships and the increased activity. Residential mortgage income decreased $15 million or 17% as higher interest rates pressured volumes and gain-on-sale margins. Servicing income was essentially flat from the prior quarter as lower prepays were offset by increasing hedging costs. While this is a very challenging environment for mortgage, our mortgage team is playing some offense. By leveraging Truist's strong purpose and balance sheet to hire select, well-regarded loan officers as well as acquire certain servicing portfolios. Investment banking and trading income was relatively flat sequentially and declined 37% year-over-year as market volatility continues to negatively impact most products. Investment banking pipelines remain full across all products, but the realization of these pipelines will continue to remain subject to more stable market conditions. Service charges on deposits were relatively flat sequentially as favorable seasonal trends were offset by the elimination of certain overdraft fees in April, resulting in client savings of approximately $20 million during the quarter.  We included a table at the bottom of Slide 13 to make other income trends more clear. Other income, excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and last quarter's merchant gain, decreased $25 million, primarily due to a loss on a certain sale of SBIC funds to diversify our private equity investment portfolio.  Turning to Slide 14. Reported expenses decreased $94 million sequentially to $3.6 billion. The lower expenses were driven by $180 million or 43% reduction in merger costs due to diminishing integration activity. Adjusted expenses increased $119 million. Personnel expenses increased $64 million due to seasonally higher insurance-related incentive compensation, the full impact of normal first quarter compensation increases and ongoing investments in talent across our lines of business and technology teams.  In addition, other expense increased $19 million due to higher operational losses and ongoing normalization of teammate travel. Professional fees and outside processing costs increased $16 million, primarily due to the increase in call center staffing. As Bill mentioned, our minimum wage will increase to $22 per hour effective October 1. This represents a significant investment in our teammates and is expected to increase our personnel expense by $200 million annually, offset by lower turnover expense and improved execution and client experience.  Moving to Slide 15. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio and solid economic conditions. Leading credit indicators remain benign. Criticized and classified commercial loans decreased 6% sequentially and are 37% lower to a year ago. Our NPL ratio was flat at 36 basis points and loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 3 basis points to 69 basis points. Our net charge-off ratio also decreased 3 basis points to 22 basis points. We experienced a slight build in the allowance due to loan growth. Although the allowance coverage ratio decreased 6 basis points to 138 basis points, given our strong portfolio performance, tempered somewhat by our moderately slower economic outlook. While the weighting of our pessimistic baseline and optimistic scenarios were unchanged from the first quarter, each scenario is moderately worse, a trend that may continue. Moving on Slide 16. Our CET1 ratio declined 20 basis points to 9.2%, strong loan growth and a $250 million share repurchase during the second quarter. As previously announced, our Board will consider an 8% increase in the quarterly common dividend at its July meeting. If approved, the increase will take effect in the third quarter and will continue to position Truist as one of the dividend leaders in our peer group. We were also pleased with the performance during the 2022 stress test. Truist had the second lowest CET1 erosion and a loan loss reserve rate in the peer group under severely adverse scenario. Our preliminary stress test capital buffer remained flat at 250 basis points. We believe these results demonstrate our strong capital relative to the risk and profitability profile, the latter of which should improve over time. We are now more comfortable operating below our previously announced CET1 ratio target of 9.75% given our continued strong stress test results and significantly reduced integration risk. Overall, the economic outlook will influence how much we operate below the prior target. From a funding perspective, end-of-period loan growth exceeded deposit growth. Truist has multiple sources available to fund incremental loan growth, as seen this quarter with the use of brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances and our securities portfolio. I will now provide guidance for full year 2022 and new guidance for the third quarter. In 2022, we now expect adjusted revenue to grow 3.5% to 4.5% from 2021. The mixture of revenue continues to tilt more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower fees, primarily in market-sensitive businesses such as investment banking, mortgage, and wealth. We now expect adjusted non-interest expense to increase 2% to 3% from 2021. This increase in expense outlook largely reflects higher operating losses and intentional investments to support our shift from integrating to operating, including increasing our minimum wage, hiring teammates to support client experience and growth, and ongoing investments in technology. Net-net, this is slightly higher PPNR outlook versus our previously full year guide. In light of our performance during the first half of the year and the benign credit environment, we expect net charge-off ratio to be in the 25 to 35 basis points for the full year. Looking into the third quarter, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow high single-digits in the second quarter level, primarily as a result of higher net interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense. We expect mid-20 basis point increase in our core net interest margin due to the benefits from recent rate hikes and a projected 75 basis point hike in July. We also expect low 20 basis point increase in GAAP net interest margin as a result of core net interest margin expansion, offset by continued declines in purchase accounting accretion. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude. Good morning. Yes, Betsy. So I would first start with, we were really excited to have really strong broad-based loan growth this quarter, and we expect that to continue, as Bill said in his prepared remarks. To fund that, we're going to start with the runoff of our investment portfolio. We built the investment portfolio when we had all that excess liquidity. We're very comfortable letting that run off and have that -- have a positive mix change on the balance sheet. As far as brokered deposits, we did add some brokered deposits over the last several months. I would say, we're probably at where we want to be from that perspective, knowing that we still have a lot of capacity and other funding sources available in the marketplace. You look at Federal Home Loan Bank advances and negotiable CDs and other amounts, we paid all that off during COVID in 2020 and we have much amount of capacity there. The other thing from an investment portfolio perspective, we're about $145 billion, give or take. And we feel comfortable we could shrink that portfolio probably $20 billion to $25 billion easily and still stay within our liquidity and LCR guidelines that we have to for regulatory purposes. Though, as far as our strategies for pricing, we were really pleased, as Bill talked about, across our company, our deposit betas came in much better than modeled. We modeled 25 for the first 100. And if you look in the second quarter, we came at 15, and that includes brokered. When you back out the brokered, we were only at 8%, which is really, really low. I would say, we will continue to use that strategy. We're going to make sure that we take care of our clients and use the ability to do exception pricing. But I think overall, I think we will continue to hopefully continue to outperform our model expectations. And your hedge question. I just \u2013 we are just gradually starting to add some receivers out in the forward markets for the most part out one to two years. Since we are steady on the way up on deposit rates, you won't have as much capacity on the way down. So we're just putting in these forward hedges and protect manages income as rates might potentially fall overall. But we still are asset sensitive though decreasing as rates continue to go up. Good morning. Yes. So Gerard, I would just tell you that I think it was a lot of great work with our teammates. We're working with clients and giving what we thought was appropriate. Most of our clients aren't there just for rate because we have other products and services. They really like to bank with us for those reasons. So they aren't as rate-sensitive as other clients might be in other places. So I think that's really the benefit of our franchise. I do agree with you though, as interest rates go up, our deposit betas will continue to climb just because more and more people will get a little bit more asset-sensitive. In the prepared remarks, I did say that our cumulative beta would move from 15% to 25% in the second to third quarter on a cumulative basis. We would still expect it to go on if the Fed continues to raise interest rates that you continue to see Fed cumulative beta increasing. And probably if you look at from second quarter to fourth quarter, we may be in the low 30s, give or take a couple of percentage points there. So overall, if you go back to where we were during the Great Recession, much better overall performance than what we had a few of our banks were combined back then. So I think right now, I think we feel very good. And I think that you're going to see really positive growth in our net interest income because of that. You also asked for containment of expenses on a go-forward basis. As we look to rationalize and get back to business as usual, I think there's still opportunities in our corporate real estate portfolio. I think as we continue to rationalize our branch network on closure of some branches over time just as behaviors change with our clients. I think we've talked about this before, but we still have a lot of initiatives that our teammates came up with that would help us from both the cost savings as well as revenue and client experience perspective, and we're in the midst of implementing those over the next 12 to 18 months. We also are moving towards a new card platform over the next year or two, which would generate some savings once we both combine to that. From a technology perspective, we are starting to put more applications up into the cloud which, over time, we're also generating some savings. And last thing I just want to mention is, as you look at our operations, both front and back office, the digitization and artificial intelligence projects that are rolling out, all part and very important to how the company runs and operates. It gives us comfort that our expenses will be contained over the next year or two. Hey, Erika, I'll start and Clarke can help finish me off on this. But when we set the amounts, obviously, it's scenario-based. It's always forward-looking from that perspective. In the prepared remarks, we did say that there is potential that the scenarios can continue to deteriorate. If that is the case, then you would expect us to continue to add to our allowance. And that would add to our provision costs as that moves up from that perspective. But right now, we aren't seeing a whole lot. And there could be some deterioration from that perspective, but let me kick it back over to Clarke."

            "name": "Beau Cummins",
            "content": "Look, I mean, we are monitoring that very carefully. So I think what we're seeing probably a little bit of indication would be the low to moderate income consumer, think cohorts $50,000 incomes and below. We're seeing higher delinquent -- early delinquency in those areas. But it's not translated yet into higher late-stage delinquencies or losses. So, for example, in our subprime auto business, we had one of our lower loss rates this quarter seasonally and we're seeing things slightly because of the Manheim being up, consumers higher redemption rates even on repo. So it's not yet translated into any losses. We've also looked at our deposit levels or our consumer borrowers and they're not coming down rapidly, particularly for the moderate income and above. So while there's early signs we're watching, it's not translated into any significant concerns. And our outlook right now for the rest of the year does not assume any significant deterioration."

            "content": "Yes, Erika, I would just say this, and Bill mentioned it and Daryl earlier, as we came through the quarter, we refreshed all of our scenarios. So our baseline, which is 40% of our estimate, is a more pessimistic outlook, slower economy. And then, we have a 30% weight on a recessionary, a more pessimistic scenario. So we feel like we've been pretty conservative in our estimate this quarter. And also this quarter, we had really good loan growth and very highly rated credits. So those carry a lower relative reserve rate. So that's why you didn't see a big build this quarter. You saw 6 basis points decline in our allowance. That was because of the growth. So we believe we've accounted for some of the recessionary risk right now. And so, as we look forward, the main driver of changing the allowance would be growth. Unless the scenarios get more severe, and then obviously, our reserve rate would have to change."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation.\nAnkur Vyas: Thank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's first quarter 2022 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Daryl Bible. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's forwarder results and share their perspectives on how we continue to activate Truist's purpose, our progress on the merger and current business conditions. Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist IR website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. In addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and achieved webcasts are located on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid first quarter results, representing the diversity and flexibility of Truist in a more volatile market and business environment. Net interest income declined sequentially due to lower day count, lower PPP revenue and purchase accounting. Net interest margin slightly exceeded our expectations, and more importantly, both NII and NIM appear to have bottomed and have good upside from here. Fee income was below expectations, primarily due to investment banking and mortgage both of which were negatively impacted by the market environment. These effects were partially offset by higher insurance income, which underscores the advantages of our diverse business mix. Expenses were lower than expected, reflecting strong expense discipline and lower incentive compensation associated with softer fee income. We experienced continued solid loan growth, albeit with headwinds in certain areas. Credit quality remains excellent, contributing to another provision benefit. We also completed our largest conversion event in February. There is a palpable level of excitement from our teammates to go to market as One Truist with an expanded toolkit to better fulfill our purpose. We'll share more details on these topics during the presentation. First and foremost, we are guided by our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We're convinced that our purpose reinstates the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day, and it provides a framework for how we make decisions. On Slide 5, we highlight some of the ways we're bringing purpose to life. A key area of focus for Truist is financial inclusion. We're wholly committed to removing barriers and improving access to the financial system for all communities, which is why I'm pleased that the Truist foundation is supporting nonprofits that serve women and minority-owned small businesses and advancing digital equity among historically underserved communities. We know people want to work for companies that stand for something meaningful and the combination of our purpose-driven culture with our industry-leading compensation and benefits, training, development and flexible approach to work is highly effective at attracting and retaining top talent. We plan to further strengthen our benefits programs by launching an employee stock purchase program later this year, subject to shareholder approval. We also implemented our Truist work model with a focus on intentional flexibility as our teammates return to on-site work throughout March. Personally, it was just incredibly energizing to have so much in-person engagement over the last two months whether with teammates, clients, community members or shareholders. Hybrid and more flexible works here to stay, but I'm pleased at how our team mates have embraced this new model. We're also doing our part to convert climate change. And in late January, announced our plans to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We're externalizing our own net zero aspirations and furthering the transition to a low-carbon economy by adding new teammates in our CIB and Commercial Community Bank to help our clients make their own transition. Lastly, we completed our largest core bank conversion event in February. This was an enormous undertaking with that involved transitioning nearly 7 million clients to the Truist ecosystem and unveiling roughly 6,000 Truist signs across our footprint, which will further build our brand. The integration was successful overall, especially when you consider the scale and complexity involved. This was the largest bank technology integration in over 15 years. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and preparation as well as the many personal sacrifices they've made to ensure the integration was successful. Because of you, we now have millions of Truist clients who are absolutely pleased with their experience. At the same time, it's also impossible to execute an integration of this magnitude perfectly. We acknowledge there were some opportunities to improve along the way. Our teams did an incredible job in resolving client challenges with urgency and a view towards long-term client and teammate experience improvements. My commitment, though, is that we will not rest until every client is satisfied. Coming to Slide 7. Our adjusted results exclude $166 million of after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges and $155 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses-related merger. We also generated a $57 million after-tax gain on redemption of a non-controlling equity interest related to the acquisition of certain merchant service relationships, which will provide Truist a larger share of the economics and more control over the end-to-end client experience. Finally, we incurred a $53 million after-tax loss to reposition approximately $3 billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately 100 basis points. The total EPS impact of these items was $0.24 per share. Daryl will provide more details on these items later in the presentation. Turning to our first quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. We earned $1.3 billion or $0.99 a share on a reported basis. Excluding the selected items on Slide 7, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $1.23 per share, up 4.2% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by lower loan loss provision. Compared to the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS declined 11% driven primarily by a 4% decrease in adjusted revenue attributed to more challenging market conditions and fee businesses such as investment banking and residential mortgage in addition to some normal seasonal patterns. Adjusted ROTCE was a strong 22.6%, unchanged from the prior two quarters. Even excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still strong at 19.9%. Adjusted expenses decreased slightly as seasonal headwinds were offset by lower incentive compensation due to softer fee income in addition to our ongoing merger-related cost save efforts. While operating leverage was a negative 240 basis points year-over-year, we are still targeting positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Asset quality continues to be excellent, and net charge-offs remain low, contributing to a provision benefit during the quarter. Capital deployment remained healthy in the first quarter as we completed the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard and certain merchant services relationships and funded solid organic loan growth. I'll provide more details about loan growth shortly. Overall, we're off to a slower start in 2022 than we would like, but I believe our performance can improve throughout the year. In addition to the core bank conversion, we completed the migration of our retail business and wealth clients to the new Truist digital experience and now have sunset all heritage digital experiences. As you'll recall, early in the merger, we made the decision to build a completely new digital experience rather than relying on existing systems and parties given the increasing importance of digital channels to our clients, we've built this new platform based directly on clients' feedback, and we've introduced it in waves, learning from each release and continually improving. With a more modern and agile platform and approach, we're able to introduce a number of new features to both sets of heritage clients in advance of the core bank conversion and our speed of client experience improvements will only accelerate in the coming months and quarters as our digital and technology teams shift their efforts from integration. A great example of this will be Truist Assist, which will be our new cloud-based self-service digital assistant that we'll introduce in the second quarter and will be accessible to all our clients 24/7 via various digital channels. Truist Assist will help clients execute basic tasks, schedules and provide insights and recommendations so they can have more control and confidence in their financial well-being. In addition, we're executing and investing in a number of other areas over the coming quarters to improve our clients and teammates digital experience, including, but not limited to, digital payments, digital on-boarding, enhanced authentication technology and expanding LightStream to include a new deposit product on a real-time cloud-based core. Turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Average loan balances grew 0.8% sequentially and rose 1.2%, excluding PPP loans. Sequential loan growth was driven primarily by C&I which increased 5.1%, excluding PPP and mortgage warehouse lending, where balances have declined rapidly due to declines in refinance volumes. Loans grew across all CIB industry practice groups and growth was particularly strong within our Asset Finance group. Commercial Community Bank C&I loans grew 2.4%, excluding PPP, fairly broad-based across many of our regions. Revolver utilization and revolver exposure both grew in the quarter. CRE continues to be a headwind, given a very competitive market or optimistic that we're approaching stabilization. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances decreased 2%, driven primarily by a 3% decline in auto that was attributable to ongoing supply chain issues in a highly competitive environment. We also experienced continued declines in our home equity and student loan portfolios. These pressures were partly offset by service finance, which is performing well and off to a great start. This quarter, we were also excited to announce a new alliance with State Farm, whereby their agents will be able to offer consumer lending products through LightStream. We'll pilot this program later in the year and loan volumes will build over time. This alliance reflects Truist's increasing size, scale and relevance in addition to the superior digital capabilities and client experience that LightStream provides. In summary, we continue to be positive about the prospects for further loan growth in light of the current economic conditions in our pipelines, our increased capacity as a company to focus on clients post integration and our differentiated set of consumer businesses. At the same time, though, we've got to acknowledge the increased uncertainty presented by a range of geopolitical and economic risk, which could cause loan growth to deviate from our outlook. Now turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposit balances increased 1% during the first quarter, reflecting some moderation from the 2% pace observed in the fourth quarter. Total deposit costs were stable at 3 basis points. As interest rate environment involves, we'll take a balanced approach to managing deposits, being attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. Guided by our purpose and our desire to be responsive to the needs of our clients, as previously announced, we'll discontinue a host of overdraft-related fees at the end of this month. We also remain on track to launch our new Truist One checking account experienced this summer, which will have zero overdraft fees, the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need to -- via a simple $100 negative balance buffer and a deposit-based credit line limit up to $750. We're mindful of the impacts that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on certain segments of our clients particularly the least advantaged and Truist One of the many examples of where we're advancing financial inclusion. Despite the financial impacts we've discussed previously, this is a long-term win for our stakeholders as we endeavor to improve retention, increase acquisition, and enhance the overall client experience. And with that, let me now turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail.\nDaryl Bible: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income decreased 2% sequentially as the impact of two fewer days and lower purchase accounting accretion offset the benefits of solid loan growth and higher securities yields. Reported net interest margin was flat and core net interest margin increased 2 basis points both exceeding our guidance by 2 basis points. The improvement in core net interest margin was primarily driven by lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. Moving to Slide 13. Truist has intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, being well positioned to benefit from higher rates in the near-term while maintaining some level of downside protection if and when interest rates decline. We continue to be asset sensitive and estimate a 100 basis point ramp rate increase would increase NII by 4.3%, a 100 basis point shock would increase NII by 7.3%. Approximately 80% of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve. While early, deposit betas thus far are tracking below modeled expectations. Moving to Slide 14. Adjusted revenue declined 4.4% linked quarter, which is below our guidance range of down 1% to 2% and driven almost entirely by weaker-than-expected fee income. Fees declined 8% sequentially and reflecting challenging market conditions and seasonality. Investment banking and trading income declined $116 million or 31% as more volatile market conditions impacted M&A, high yield, leverage finance and equity. Investment banking pipelines look healthy, but market conditions will determine both how much and when the pipeline is realized. Residential mortgage income declined $70 million or 44% as higher interest rates reduced refinance activity and pressured gain on sale margins on the production side. Servicing was not as large of an offset as expected since the benefits of slowing DK were eroded by higher hedging costs due to the flatter yield curve. Part and payment fees and service charges on deposits declined $33 million collectively primarily driven by seasonal but also due to client-friendly fee waivers we instituted in and around the time of our February conversion. These items were partially offset by insurance income, which increased 9% primarily due to strong organic growth and the first month of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. We included a table at the bottom of Slide 14 to make other income trends more clear. Other income, excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and other gains was up $31 million sequentially given negative valuation adjustment for Visa-related derivative last quarter and up $56 million year-over-year primarily as a result of higher SBIC income. Turning to Slide 15. Reported expenses were $3.7 billion, including $216 million of merger-related costs and $202 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The merger costs in the quarter were primarily connected to new Truist signs, branch closings and impairments and data center decommissioning efforts. Adjusted expenses decreased sequentially, exceeding our guidance of up 1% to 2% and reflecting our disciplined expense management. The drivers of the decline include decreased personnel costs, reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and changes to the nonqualified plan, partially offset by seasonally higher FICA and 401(k) expenses. The decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by increased marketing costs as we continue building our brand. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, adjusted expenses were stable as cost saves from FTE reductions and lower occupancy costs were offset by continued investments in software and marketing, along with higher operational losses. The operational losses have steadily increased in recent quarters as banks are experiencing higher levels of fraud activity, in addition to our own decisions to enhance client experience. We remain highly focused on reducing our operational losses and improving our client experience at the same time. Overall, we have incurred significant costs in conjunction with the integration events, both in the merger categories as well as run rate fees and expenses. We were excited that our last major conversion event is behind us, and we can start to reduce the financial costs associated with these integrations. Moving to Slide 16. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio and favorable economic conditions. Our net charge-off ratio for the first quarter was unchanged at 25 basis points. The ALLL ratio decreased to 1.44%, resulting in a provision benefit of $95 million first quarter. Our reserve levels reflect current credit conditions but also take into account uncertainty associated with inflation, rising rates and geopolitical events. Truist has no direct credit exposure to Russia or Ukraine and minimal indirect exposure. Including RAC, our exposure to subprime at the origination is 1% or less in the other consumer portfolios. Continuing on Slide 17. Capital and liquidity levels remain strong. Our CET1 ratio declined approximately 20 basis points as a result of capital deployments related to the acquisitions of Kensington Vanguard and certain merchant service relationships, growth in risk-weighted assets and the CECL phase-in. In order to mitigate ACI risk and volatility, we transferred approximately 40% of the securities portfolio to held to maturity during the first quarter. Because we are a Category 3 institution, AOCI does not impact regulatory capital, it simply impacts tangible common equity. We submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early April and look forward to sharing more details later this summer. Moving to Slide 18. This slide provides additional details about three transactions we completed in the first quarter to enhance our future earnings and profitability. First, Kensington Vanguard acquisition significantly expands our presence in title insurance, augments our capabilities in larger and more complex commercial transactions and will also provide additional IRM opportunities given our significant presence in CRE. We anticipate Kensington Vanguard will add $115 million in revenue annually and be accretive to insurance EBITDA margin by year two. Second, we terminated merchant revenue share alliance in which Truist had a non-controlling interest. The transaction resulted in a $74 million gain from marking our stake to fair value. In addition, we acquired significant portion of relationships from this alliance. This will position us to control more of the end client experience when serving those clients. We also believe that the acquisition will generate approximately $25 million of additional cash, PPNR annually. Last, we repositioned $3 billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately 100 basis points resulting in a two-year payback. Moving to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned, we successfully completed our large core bank conversion in February. We are now One Truist, not just culturally, but also in terms of branding, digital and technology, which allows us to serve our clients more effectively and make our company simpler to operate. As we shift our focus from integration to executional excellence, we will maintain our focus on realizing remaining cost savings. Much of that will happen in the second half of '22 as we decommission over 900 business applications and three of our six data centers. Our decommissioning efforts are complex and significant, and we are on track. With our final integration largely complete, our technology teams will shift towards more further enhancing client and teammate experience. Turning to Slide 21. We have made excellent progress across the five cost-save buckets and are closing in on our commitment to achieve $1.6 billion in net cost saves. Third-party spend is down 11.9% from baseline levels exceeding our targeted reduction of 10%. This quarter, we closed over 400 branches exceeding our commitment to close over 800 total branches by the end of the first quarter of 2022. We now have finished the merger-related branch reduction efforts and will shift to more normal course branch network optimization. We have also achieved our targeted reduction in non-branch facility space, strategically reducing our occupancy costs through consolidation and closures. However, we still have more opportunities in which we are working. Excluding acquisitions average FTEs are down 1% linked quarter and 14% since the merger. Our voluntary separation and retirement program will conclude in the next two quarters, further supporting our ongoing cost saving efforts. I will now provide guidance for the full year '22 and new guidance for the second quarter. In 2022, we now expect adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4% from 2021. Relative to our outlook from January, the mix of revenue growth is now tilted more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by weaker fees, primarily in residential mortgage and investment banking. This represents 6% to 7% core revenue growth when you exclude significant decline in PPP and purchase accounting. As you will recall, we expect a mid-single-digit decline in service charges in 2022 given our elimination of certain overdraft-related fees and introduction of Truist One Banking. NII and net interest margin bottomed in the first quarter and should increase throughout the year based on the forward curve. We continue to expect point-to-point loan growth ex-PPP in the mid-single digits. But as Bill said, we acknowledge higher levels of economic uncertainty. We will be at the high end of our 1% to 2% increase of adjusted noninterest expense largely due to the impact of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. The first quarter was the peak for our merger-related costs, and now we are projecting less than $400 million for the rest of this year and none in 2023. We are still targeting positive operating leverage on a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2022, though this is somewhat dependent on interest rates and market conditions. We still expect net charge-off ratio to be in the 30 to 40 basis points given our assumptions for normalization throughout the year. Looking into the second quarter, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow high single digit with possible upside from the first quarter level. As a result, higher net interest income and much longer fee income given seasonality in insurance and the potential rebound of investment banking, this outlook assumes the forward curve in interest rates and controlled deposit betas. We expect core net interest margin to increase approximately 7 to 10 basis points due to the benefits from the March hike and from a projected 50 basis point hike in May. GAAP net interest margin is expected to increase only 3 to 4 basis points as purchase accounting accretion is slowing, given lower prepayment environment as a result of higher rates. Now I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Daryl. Moving to Slide 22. The first quarter of 2022 was historic for Truist as we're now serving our clients as a true unified Truist across all dimensions. In addition, the first quarter is a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Strategically, the completion of our core bank conversion positions us to fully shift our focused executional excellence, transformation and growth. Our businesses that went through earlier conversions in 2021 such as wealth and mortgage are beginning to see the benefits of this shift whether in the form of new adviser hiring in wealth or significantly improve client satisfaction scores and mortgage. Financially, the first quarter should be at the bottom for net interest income and net interest margin and fee performance should improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as a company. In addition, the completion of the integration means merger costs will decrease dramatically through the remainder of 2022 and we'll realize our remaining cost saves as data centers and systems are decommissioned in the back half of the year, all of which helped drive positive operating leverage. To conclude, I remain highly optimistic about the potential and opportunity for Truist, all of which are clearly summarized on Slide 23, our investment thesis. Our opportunity and priorities are clear: shift from an integration focus to execution focus, deliver better client experiences, capture the significant IRM and revenue synergy potential we have to shift the millions of hours of development training and effort from the integration to building better lives for our clients. This shift does not require any incremental risk appetite or capital. It only requires execution and focus. At the same time, while we believe the economy is on sound footing in the near term, the headwinds of geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with the inflationary environment and aggressive forecast for the tightening of monetary policy create a wide range of economic outlook as we move further into this year and next. Truist is well positioned across all of these environments, given our advice-oriented model for our clients, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix and strong and improving earnings profile. And with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you.\nAnkur Vyas: Thanks, Bill. Katie, at this time, will you explain to our participants how they can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Bill, can you elaborate or Daryl as well, I guess, on the loan growth that you guys are seeing, I think, Bill, you touched on some very competitive forces in the commercial real estate markets. And what are you guys seeing in that area? And then on the residential mortgage business, Daryl, I think you referenced that the refinancing business was down. What percentage of originations are refinancing in the home mortgage business?\nDaryl Bible: Gerard, let me start on the loan growth and maybe sort of cover a variety of different topics in your question. We're seeing interesting loan growth and I think the places that most highly correlate to performance, I think, is where we're performing well. So, I think C&I as an example. So in C&I, if you exclude PPP, where remember, we were over-indexed appropriately, you exclude the mortgage warehouse component, which has a lot of seasonal components to it, it sort of dissected to core C&I, it was up about a little over 5%. So we think that actually reflects the core component of where we see loan growth and the power and the execution of our franchise. That was particularly strong and literally across all of our business lines that was good across virtually all of our geographies areas like asset finance and ABL, sort of geared supply chain were particularly strong. You asked about CRE, and I'd say it's a couple of different stories. On the small CRE side, we have had some runoff. Some of that's been intentional in the focused areas. On the sort of higher-end institutional borrowers, we actually performed very well. We've been very competitive on the residential and industrial side, particularly think specialized areas like data centers and those types of those types of things. Clients are flying portfolios. But it is an aggressive market. So I think the places where we want to be competitive, we're really competitive in the areas that we've allowed a little runoff, we've allowed a little runoff to happen there. Daryl, do you want to talk specifically about -- I think there was a question about the refi?\nDaryl Bible: Yes. On the residential, Gerard, about two-thirds of our activity was in refinance activity. That has really come down significantly. As we move to the second quarter, it's more of a purchase market kind of plays to our strength from that perspective. So I think we're hopeful that, that will kind of maintain and hopefully build as the year goes on, but refi is definitely being impacted. The other impact on the residential mortgage is just the cost of hedging is just a lot higher right now. So, it's offsetting some of the servicing benefit that you would get out there.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, Bill, Truist has a unique franchise where you've got your regional precedence throughout your franchise, so you have a good pulse on what's going on in those markets. Can you give us an update on what your customers are telling you? Obviously, we're in a very uncertain time with the tragedy going on over in Ukraine. What are they feeling? And are they still pretty optimistic about their business outlook?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Maybe I'll do it in two ways, and maybe I'll do it in -- starting with the tangible side. If you look at production and pipeline specifically, they're really strong. Our pipelines particularly in that core commercial business, which you're talking about in the first quarter are equal to where they were in the fourth quarter in terms of strength. So in terms of the evidence of what we see in terms of pipelines and production, I'd say there still is a great deal of confidence. Virtually every client is in some inventory build capacity. I mean from a supply chain perspective, they're all wishing to increase their inventory to serve an increasing demand. Demand does not seem to be the particular challenge. So I'd say that's the tangible part. Now the intangible part in talking to clients, sort of where everybody is and what some of the anecdotal evidence, I don't think we're in a full risk-off mode, but there's a little bit of a wait and see. I mean, I think that's fair. Maybe a little bit of a blinking yellow light, not a red light, nobody's stopping. So I think the combination of this tangible part that we see in terms of pipeline production, need for inventory build is really solid and would be reasons to be really optimistic all with just a little bit of a cautionary note as people look forward into the next several quarters.\nDaryl Bible: The only thing I would add to that, on the consumer side, it's fair to say in February during the conversion our branch people were really distracted just going through the integration and the efforts. I think we've come out of that strong now, and we're starting to see momentum in loan origination out of the branch areas. And if you look at our consumer convenience businesses that we have like LightStream and Sheffield and Service Finance, they're all starting off really strong and seeing really good volumes as we enter into the second quarter.\nBill Rogers: Yes. So I think to bump those comments, I mean, there's reason to have a lot of optimism with just a slight level of uncertainty, which sort of is the right balance.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: One question on just the outlook here for how we should be thinking about net interest margin. And part of the reason I ask is when I'm looking at the average balances where you show what the yields did Q-on-Q. We have some declines in consumer loans. So I'm just wondering, is that like swap related or is there something more intimate going on in the portfolio? I'm just wondering how quickly that should bounce back given the outlook for rates that you've got?\nDaryl Bible: Yes, Betsy, I think what you're looking at, we can maybe check off the line, but I think it's just the runoff of purchase accounting. When you look at our new rates going on the books, our new volume rates are going on higher than what the existing portfolio is right now. So, we are averaging up in most cases across the board there. So, I think overall, yields will rise and when we have our projections throughout the year, I expect net interest margin to continue to rise throughout the year, NII to continue to grow just as the interest rates start to climb.\nBetsy Graseck: And then just to follow on there is. How do you think about your deposit strategy? How interested are you going to be in generating accelerating deposit growth? Or would you be more in the mode of allowing runoff? Just trying to understand the balance sheet size and how we should think through that.\nDaryl Bible: If you look at what we've attracted from COVID, $80-plus billion of new deposit funding, the vast majority of that is noninterest-bearing. And when you look at it, we pay the lowest rates of anybody else in the industry. So almost all of it is non-rate sensitive. So we definitely feel that we have betas modeled in to protect what we want to protect out there. There could be a little bit of ebb and flow. But for the most part, we will be specific to make sure that we protect our good clients throughout the organization and do that. But right now, we've had rates just started to lift off and our deposit betas that we're seeing right now are coming in much less than what we modeled. It's very early into this. But I think right now, I think it's not a huge impact on what we've had to pay and we still have the deposits growing for us, so non-interest-bearing growth from us in this past quarter as well.\nBill Rogers: And that's what I might add to that, we're operating now as a new Truist. So we're operating with a company that has about an 18% average market share. So in number one, two or three market share in most of our markets. So that's a new experience. Also this increased capacity and marketing expense. So our unaided brand awareness has really gone up actually fairly significantly since the rollout. And then we just have a lot more capabilities other than rate pay. I mean we just have a lot more tools and capabilities to offer our clients. So, we're operating in the kind of -- this is the kind of environment we built through Truist forward in fairness. We have company that's got that kind of prowess and capability to serve our clients in ways other than just rate paid.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: I wanted to ask about the securities portfolio and the repositioning you did this quarter. So can you just talk a little bit about just where do you want that portfolio size to sit? And is the changes that you made, the sales and the repurchases in the forward outlook for NII?\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So I think the way we are managing the balance sheet, and we've talked about this before is, right now, we are targeting $15 billion to $20 billion of balances at the Fed. Since the war started in the first quarter, we're tilted a little bit towards the heavier side of that just for liquidity purposes. And you really look at the cash flows of the whole balance sheet in total. So we've had deposit growth come in, so that's a positive inflow. You have runoff of securities. That's a positive inflow. Our first priority is to lend it out to our clients and to basically do that. Once we've done what we can do from a lending perspective, then the residual piece would basically go into the securities portfolio. Now from a securities portfolio perspective, we're investing in the past in treasuries, MBS. So, those are very high-grade, very secure-type securities.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And then the repositioning that you did this quarter, I assume that, that's built into the outlook. And I guess, is that generally where you're purchasing now? You've mentioned in the slide deck 3.2, is that where the front book is from here?\nDaryl Bible: So yes, the mix of what you're doing, if you go into treasuries, it isn't a forecast, Treasuries are in the 270s, 280s between the three- to five-year area. MBS are approaching 4%. So, it'll blend there. But I would say, we'd be on the shorter end of that on a duration perspective, but all that is incorporated with the guidance we gave you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: I just want to follow up on Ken's question. Just more broadly, how are you guys thinking about managing capital? On the regulatory side, you're still well above your regulatory minimums with the 9.4% CET1, but a little bit below where you usually target how you're thinking about that? And then on the GAAP side, how are you thinking about managing against further OCI risks as keep going up potentially?\nBill Rogers: Hey, John, it's Bill. Why don't I maybe start on the capital side? I mean, I think we've been very consistent about thinking about where we wanted to establish capital, where we want to operate based on three primary factors. One was just where we were in the merger, how much risk do we have on the merger, do we need to allow additional capital for merger risk. That's obviously come down substantially. I mean, I would consider that sort of be in a normal mode right now, and we don't -- we've gotten through the big components of that really, really successfully. The second is how much economic risk do we have? And we probably have a little more economic risk in fairness than we had a year ago, but I think maybe on the marginal side. And then sort of where we fit from risk profile as evidenced by some of the CCAR results. And I think will be another confirmation of our lower risk profile, higher PPNR model as Truist. So, those are the three things that we put into the mixing bowl as it relates to capital. And we'll continue to reevaluate that. We feel very comfortable where we are right now. We'll reevaluate that in the mid part of this year and try to determine the appropriate place for Truist to operate. But I feel like we've got a lot of opportunity in the capital side based on the evaluation of those risks. And Daryl, would you answer the other part of that question.\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So on the OCI, John, what I would tell you is Category 3 it's not in our regulatory capital numbers. 99% of our portfolio is guaranteed. So it's just a matter of timing. We're going to get the funding back. It's not a permanent impairment that you see. There are partial offsets once a year you mark your pension plan that Mark will obviously be against what the OCI is, which would be some benefit at 12/31. But the real hedge when you really look at this is the economic hedge with deposits. I mean deposits have increased in value. We don't mark to market these non-maturity deposits, but we really look at it. The value of that has well exceeded the adjustment than what you saw on the securities portfolio. So that's really, I think, the offset that you see there. If we wanted to, we could put more than 40% into held to maturity, I don't think we're there yet where we need to do that from that perspective. I think we feel good with what we've done today.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then one nitpick as a follow-up, Daryl, the duration of the AFS portfolio before the transfers, I think it was about $5 million, do you have the new number on what that looks like now after you've moved some to held to maturity?\nDaryl Bible: About 6.5%, and our modeling, even with rates going up higher is basically capped out. So, we're really in the six handle, and that's where it's going to be until rates start to fall again.\nJohn McDonald: 6.5% now.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Sorry if I missed that earlier, but did you say how much of the $1.6 billion of cost saves you're looking to achieve by year end in the 1Q run rate?\nDaryl Bible: Yes. Matt, what I would say, it's pretty minimal. I mean we had a little bit more reduction in VSRP at the beginning of the quarter. Most of the branch closures were back-end loaded in the quarter. Some of the technology savings that's going to come through that's really all in the second half. We have a little bit more closures in corporate real estate. So, I would say, it's much more back-end loaded. We maybe got a little bit, but the vast majority of it would be in the second half of '22.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. When you say a little bit, meaning a little bit more than last quarter, right? Because you already had at least a chunk of the 1.6 in the run rate at year-end, right?\nDaryl Bible: That's right. Yes. So, we were two-thirds of the way through at the end of the year. We made a little bit of progress in the first quarter, and we got more to do in the second half of '22.\nBill Rogers: Yes. I'd say, Matt, I mean -- yes, Matt, we're on really good track on the cost saves. I mean, we're ahead in most of the categories where we want to be. And now we've got a couple of remaining big chunky ones and they're binary. You close the data center and you get the cost saves. I mean, so we feel really good about where we are in that trajectory.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. And then more broadly speaking, like as we think about costs beyond this year, how do you think about -- how should we think about what Truist is trying to be? Like is this a kind of key growth low? Is it an operating leverage story? Because obviously, there's been lots of puts and takes with the merger. We also have inflation. We also have revenue benefiting from rates, which is usually a very good efficiency business. But what is Truist from an expense perspective looking out beyond this year?\nBill Rogers: Yes. I think, Matt, if we think about sort of overall for Truist, what we expect to be a low efficiency ratio company. So I think the construct of our business mix and our structure allows us to be a low-efficiency industry-leading low efficiency ratio company, sort of where that ends on an absolute basis will depend on a lot of market conditions, but we'll be at the low end of that. We will be a company with higher growth potential and less volatility. So I mean when we think about how expenses fit into that rather than sort of the absolute dollar amount in light of expenses that support a growing business and being able to do that with, I think, an industry-leading low efficiency ratio. And positive operating leverage. And maybe I showed you asked that I want to make sure I make that clear as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Just first, just a clarification. So you've guided revenue growth for this year from 2% to 4% up to 3% to 4%, and you expect $500 million of merger savings by year-end from this point forward. Is that correct?\nDaryl Bible: Roughly, I would say $400 million to $500 million, Mike, because we got a little bit of savings in the first quarter.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then more generally, Bill, you just talked about your terminal and state superior growth, superior efficiency, and I would -- from what you said before, you have superior geographies superior business mix, superior levers with the merger model. So superior, but then you look at the current loan growth and its average the current deposit growth, its average operating leverage this year looks average. So superior features, but average results, I know you're going from integration to kind of execution. But from our standpoint, it looks like you're in a corvette going 60 miles per hour. So when will this superior positioning lead to superior growth?\nBill Rogers: Okay. We're going to assume we're on the auto bot. We have no speed limits in terms of opportunity. And Mike, we're at that inflection point. I mean we talked about this. This is -- I think we're right at that pivot point. And I can feel it. I mean I can feel all the things if you categorize loan growth. But if we break it down to, I think, the things that are highly correlated to positive trajectory, I think those areas where actually we're doing well, things like sort of core C&I. Other decisions on loan growth are related to the decisions we've made about positioning our company, which I think will be really beneficial to us long term. And then I look at sort of the pivot points of, I mean, I'll pick several categories if I look at integrated relationship management. It wasn't at the level we needed it to be in sort of the fourth quarter, first quarter, we've made the pivot point, and we're starting to see significant increase, and you'll start to see that in some of our results. You see that a little bit in the insurance results in this quarter where we are in terms of positive asset flow and wealth, wealth teams and insurance teams net positive in terms of adding people. So we've reached sort of really good inflection points there. Investment banking, clearly, in terms of adding, retaining opportunities in those businesses, things like the core commercial pipelines, where we are in terms of more lead deals more on the left side, where we are positioned in terms of production in the places we want to be. So I can feel the inflection point. So maybe we're -- whatever it was 60 miles an hour, but the foot is on the accelerator, not the brake. And I totally feel that in the transition that we're making at this particular juncture, and I'm very confident about our positioning for the future.\nMike Mayo: Maybe just one follow-up. What percentage of your time was spent on the merger before and how much of it has been on continued integration now?\nBill Rogers: Jeff, I look at my personal calendar, I don't think I've been in Charlotte in the last five weeks or so. I mean, so I look at all of our leaders' time in terms of where they're spending time, and there's a significant difference. I've been much more in front of teammates, in front of clients and community. And just my own personal time, I can feel it. And in fairness, I'm just one symbol. More teammates have been in that mode for a longer period of time than I have, and we feel that power shift. I mean just thinking about it in a simple way and Daryl was talking about it in a simple way, we did about 0.5 million hours worth of training. So just maybe put that in context of which that 0.5 million hours of training, we now translate into 0.5 million hours of client-related activity just as like one symbol.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: On the efficiency, the medium-term efficiency goal of the low 50s, I just want to get a little bit more color from me in terms of what exactly would you say is needed to get there in terms of the rate backdrop? And then also in terms of timing that you see as reasonable to get to that low 50s range?\nDaryl Bible: Yes, John, you kind of go back where we were when we announced this transaction back in '19. Rates were a couple of hundred basis points higher back then. And at that point, we thought if we got those cost saves, we would be able to come in at the low 50s at that point. We're definitely a different company. We continue to buy and add businesses and all that. But we definitely have at least a forecast from the Fed for it to go up a couple basis points this year and into 2023. So assuming you get the Fed up to 3%, 3.5% and we will execute on our cost saves, we should have really strong efficiency ratios coming in. Whether we get low 50s or not, I think there's a shot that that could happen just because of the asset sensitivity that we have in the Company and what we're seeing in the marketplace, our deposit beta is how they perform. So no guarantees from that perspective, but rates going up definitely helps on the net interest income side significantly, and it's back to kind of where we were back in '19.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. And then also on the expense side, your expectation for the $492 million in incremental expenses related to the merger to roll off in 2023. What are the biggest drivers of that decline? I know you mentioned the consolidation of data centers. Like if you could just give us a little more granularity around what are the biggest components. And related to that, I know you indicated you completed your core conversion. Regarding the core deposit system, what was the upgrade there? What did you move to?\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So from a cost save perspective, obviously, technology is the biggest chunk of where the cost savings would come in. So that would be the majority of the savings, both data centers, application systems, FTEs, all in that area would basically will be cost savings. We still have more to do on -- a little bit on the VSRP that will help benefit. You have more on corporate real estate reductions. So, we have other savings. So I would say overall, now that we've moved from the integration to now running and operating the Company, we will continue to look for more efficiencies as we operate the Company to give us more fuel to make more investments in the Company as we move forward from that perspective. And I'll put it back to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Yes. And then on the core conversion, I mean, we consolidated to our heritage core platform but that doesn't really sort of explain the next-gen opportunities we have within that. So you think about the use of cloud-based and API technologies to create, for example, the digital experience, which we've talked about. So this concept of a digital straddle, we were able to convert add flexibility and add products and capabilities to our clients digitally long before we converted them physically in the core conversion. So I think we've got a really good strong first second-gen core platform with third gen, fourth gen kind of capabilities that sit on top of that. And then as you know, we're also experimenting with a new core platform for LightStream. So, I think we've got our feet in the right place where we want to be in terms of maximum flexibility listing core and experimenting with a new core with LightStream and a product called FinSac, which we've talked about before. And this digital straddle agility I think will really, really pay strong dividends for us going forward.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Just wanted to touch base on credit. One, Bill, Daryl, if you can just talk to us about the consumer book be it Sheffield, LightStream, anything in particular that you are watching around consumer trends, just a fair amount of concern around credit quality. And I'm not sure, if you can give any breakdown in terms of FICO scores within that consumer book?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Clarke, do you mind you talk about...\nClarke Starnes: Yes, Ebrahim, what I would say is that the area we're most focused on from the consumer standpoint around of more path to normalization or any potential stress out there with the inflationary pressures would be in our subprime auto book. Remember, that book is less than $5 billion to high return business. So, we are watching that really closely. And so, we're seeing the credit performance more normalized there. I would say, for the remaining consumer segments, we principally have a prime-based portfolio. So, less than 1% or so of our borrowers in those segments would be considered non-prime, so it's just not as big of an issue there, but I would say our expectations are that you'll continue to see as we go through the rest of the year. More normalization on the consumer side first and where we're watching most closely would be the lower income consumer in our subprime auto.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, when we look at the reserve ratio at 144, just give us a context of a day one CECL and where you expect to bottom out, given sort of the macro uncertainties Bill and Daryl talked about.\nClarke Starnes: Sure. And just to remind you all, our day one CECL was at 154 and at Q2 level now is at 144. So it's down 9 bps from the first quarter. And so, the other point I would make to you is our reserve coverage is even at that level, are very strong to NCOs and NPAs. So, the way we think about CECL, we continue to incorporate multiple economic scenarios and the estimate, including maintaining a pretty healthy weighting on our downside case. We also, this quarter, considered qualitatively in precision and uncertainty with respect to inflationary pressures, rate increases in the war in Ukraine. But remind you, I'd also reflected the outstanding performance we had from a risk profile and a credit performance for the quarter. So all that being said, we still anticipate potentially additional reserves in '22, but probably at a decelerated pace compared to last year. And I would just say this, obviously, the number and the amount of the releases is really dependent upon how the economic situation unfolds. Katie, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian: Just one clarification question for me. Underneath your revenue guide of 3% to 4%, is it fair for us to assume that given the outlook for Fed funds for the rest of the year, we should take that 7.2% in the up 200 ramp scenario from Slide 13 as sort of maybe the starter point for the NII growth for 2022. And maybe take 80% of that to up 5.8%, then later on how we're thinking about loan growth and the long end of the curve?\nDaryl Bible: Yes. So a lot of moving parts there. What I would say is that in spirit, I think using a good gauge with a gradual over 200, I think is a good approximation. The deposit betas we talked about earlier, we have those being phased in and that's built into these numbers. So, we're expecting 25% the first 100, 35 and the next 150 after that. Right now, we're performing better than that. But we definitely have a pickup in trajectory. If this forward curve does play out as what's embedded in there you will see a big increase in both core net interest margins from where we are today, probably peers seen 3% maybe by the end of the year.\nErika Najarian: Got it. So the follow-up here is, given what you've baked into the deposit betas in the first 100, which could be very minimal. The 7.2% in the up 200 could be the floor in terms of this year?\nDaryl Bible: I think we have good conservative estimates. So, there is a chance for outperformance, but it's still very early, Erika. So you don't really know. But I feel pretty good with these projections and feel good. Bill talked about earlier about our deposit base and our clients and density that we have. So, I think we're going to have really positive net interest income as this year plays out in the '23.\nAnkur Vyas: Okay. Thanks, everyone. This completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Katie, you may now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid first quarter results, representing the diversity and flexibility of Truist in a more volatile market and business environment. Net interest income declined sequentially due to lower day count, lower PPP revenue and purchase accounting. Net interest margin slightly exceeded our expectations, and more importantly, both NII and NIM appear to have bottomed and have good upside from here. Fee income was below expectations, primarily due to investment banking and mortgage both of which were negatively impacted by the market environment. These effects were partially offset by higher insurance income, which underscores the advantages of our diverse business mix. Expenses were lower than expected, reflecting strong expense discipline and lower incentive compensation associated with softer fee income. We experienced continued solid loan growth, albeit with headwinds in certain areas. Credit quality remains excellent, contributing to another provision benefit. We also completed our largest conversion event in February. There is a palpable level of excitement from our teammates to go to market as One Truist with an expanded toolkit to better fulfill our purpose. We'll share more details on these topics during the presentation. First and foremost, we are guided by our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We're convinced that our purpose reinstates the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day, and it provides a framework for how we make decisions. On Slide 5, we highlight some of the ways we're bringing purpose to life. A key area of focus for Truist is financial inclusion. We're wholly committed to removing barriers and improving access to the financial system for all communities, which is why I'm pleased that the Truist foundation is supporting nonprofits that serve women and minority-owned small businesses and advancing digital equity among historically underserved communities. We know people want to work for companies that stand for something meaningful and the combination of our purpose-driven culture with our industry-leading compensation and benefits, training, development and flexible approach to work is highly effective at attracting and retaining top talent. We plan to further strengthen our benefits programs by launching an employee stock purchase program later this year, subject to shareholder approval. We also implemented our Truist work model with a focus on intentional flexibility as our teammates return to on-site work throughout March. Personally, it was just incredibly energizing to have so much in-person engagement over the last two months whether with teammates, clients, community members or shareholders. Hybrid and more flexible works here to stay, but I'm pleased at how our team mates have embraced this new model. We're also doing our part to convert climate change. And in late January, announced our plans to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We're externalizing our own net zero aspirations and furthering the transition to a low-carbon economy by adding new teammates in our CIB and Commercial Community Bank to help our clients make their own transition. Lastly, we completed our largest core bank conversion event in February. This was an enormous undertaking with that involved transitioning nearly 7 million clients to the Truist ecosystem and unveiling roughly 6,000 Truist signs across our footprint, which will further build our brand. The integration was successful overall, especially when you consider the scale and complexity involved. This was the largest bank technology integration in over 15 years. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and preparation as well as the many personal sacrifices they've made to ensure the integration was successful. Because of you, we now have millions of Truist clients who are absolutely pleased with their experience. At the same time, it's also impossible to execute an integration of this magnitude perfectly. We acknowledge there were some opportunities to improve along the way. Our teams did an incredible job in resolving client challenges with urgency and a view towards long-term client and teammate experience improvements. My commitment, though, is that we will not rest until every client is satisfied. Coming to Slide 7. Our adjusted results exclude $166 million of after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges and $155 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses-related merger. We also generated a $57 million after-tax gain on redemption of a non-controlling equity interest related to the acquisition of certain merchant service relationships, which will provide Truist a larger share of the economics and more control over the end-to-end client experience. Finally, we incurred a $53 million after-tax loss to reposition approximately $3 billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately 100 basis points. The total EPS impact of these items was $0.24 per share. Daryl will provide more details on these items later in the presentation. Turning to our first quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. We earned $1.3 billion or $0.99 a share on a reported basis. Excluding the selected items on Slide 7, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $1.23 per share, up 4.2% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by lower loan loss provision. Compared to the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS declined 11% driven primarily by a 4% decrease in adjusted revenue attributed to more challenging market conditions and fee businesses such as investment banking and residential mortgage in addition to some normal seasonal patterns. Adjusted ROTCE was a strong 22.6%, unchanged from the prior two quarters. Even excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still strong at 19.9%. Adjusted expenses decreased slightly as seasonal headwinds were offset by lower incentive compensation due to softer fee income in addition to our ongoing merger-related cost save efforts. While operating leverage was a negative 240 basis points year-over-year, we are still targeting positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Asset quality continues to be excellent, and net charge-offs remain low, contributing to a provision benefit during the quarter. Capital deployment remained healthy in the first quarter as we completed the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard and certain merchant services relationships and funded solid organic loan growth. I'll provide more details about loan growth shortly. Overall, we're off to a slower start in 2022 than we would like, but I believe our performance can improve throughout the year. In addition to the core bank conversion, we completed the migration of our retail business and wealth clients to the new Truist digital experience and now have sunset all heritage digital experiences. As you'll recall, early in the merger, we made the decision to build a completely new digital experience rather than relying on existing systems and parties given the increasing importance of digital channels to our clients, we've built this new platform based directly on clients' feedback, and we've introduced it in waves, learning from each release and continually improving. With a more modern and agile platform and approach, we're able to introduce a number of new features to both sets of heritage clients in advance of the core bank conversion and our speed of client experience improvements will only accelerate in the coming months and quarters as our digital and technology teams shift their efforts from integration. A great example of this will be Truist Assist, which will be our new cloud-based self-service digital assistant that we'll introduce in the second quarter and will be accessible to all our clients 24/7 via various digital channels. Truist Assist will help clients execute basic tasks, schedules and provide insights and recommendations so they can have more control and confidence in their financial well-being. In addition, we're executing and investing in a number of other areas over the coming quarters to improve our clients and teammates digital experience, including, but not limited to, digital payments, digital on-boarding, enhanced authentication technology and expanding LightStream to include a new deposit product on a real-time cloud-based core. Turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Average loan balances grew 0.8% sequentially and rose 1.2%, excluding PPP loans. Sequential loan growth was driven primarily by C&I which increased 5.1%, excluding PPP and mortgage warehouse lending, where balances have declined rapidly due to declines in refinance volumes. Loans grew across all CIB industry practice groups and growth was particularly strong within our Asset Finance group. Commercial Community Bank C&I loans grew 2.4%, excluding PPP, fairly broad-based across many of our regions. Revolver utilization and revolver exposure both grew in the quarter. CRE continues to be a headwind, given a very competitive market or optimistic that we're approaching stabilization. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances decreased 2%, driven primarily by a 3% decline in auto that was attributable to ongoing supply chain issues in a highly competitive environment. We also experienced continued declines in our home equity and student loan portfolios. These pressures were partly offset by service finance, which is performing well and off to a great start. This quarter, we were also excited to announce a new alliance with State Farm, whereby their agents will be able to offer consumer lending products through LightStream. We'll pilot this program later in the year and loan volumes will build over time. This alliance reflects Truist's increasing size, scale and relevance in addition to the superior digital capabilities and client experience that LightStream provides. In summary, we continue to be positive about the prospects for further loan growth in light of the current economic conditions in our pipelines, our increased capacity as a company to focus on clients post integration and our differentiated set of consumer businesses. At the same time, though, we've got to acknowledge the increased uncertainty presented by a range of geopolitical and economic risk, which could cause loan growth to deviate from our outlook. Now turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposit balances increased 1% during the first quarter, reflecting some moderation from the 2% pace observed in the fourth quarter. Total deposit costs were stable at 3 basis points. As interest rate environment involves, we'll take a balanced approach to managing deposits, being attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. Guided by our purpose and our desire to be responsive to the needs of our clients, as previously announced, we'll discontinue a host of overdraft-related fees at the end of this month. We also remain on track to launch our new Truist One checking account experienced this summer, which will have zero overdraft fees, the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need to -- via a simple $100 negative balance buffer and a deposit-based credit line limit up to $750. We're mindful of the impacts that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on certain segments of our clients particularly the least advantaged and Truist One of the many examples of where we're advancing financial inclusion. Despite the financial impacts we've discussed previously, this is a long-term win for our stakeholders as we endeavor to improve retention, increase acquisition, and enhance the overall client experience. And with that, let me now turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail. Thanks, Daryl. Moving to Slide 22. The first quarter of 2022 was historic for Truist as we're now serving our clients as a true unified Truist across all dimensions. In addition, the first quarter is a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Strategically, the completion of our core bank conversion positions us to fully shift our focused executional excellence, transformation and growth. Our businesses that went through earlier conversions in 2021 such as wealth and mortgage are beginning to see the benefits of this shift whether in the form of new adviser hiring in wealth or significantly improve client satisfaction scores and mortgage. Financially, the first quarter should be at the bottom for net interest income and net interest margin and fee performance should improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as a company. In addition, the completion of the integration means merger costs will decrease dramatically through the remainder of 2022 and we'll realize our remaining cost saves as data centers and systems are decommissioned in the back half of the year, all of which helped drive positive operating leverage. To conclude, I remain highly optimistic about the potential and opportunity for Truist, all of which are clearly summarized on Slide 23, our investment thesis. Our opportunity and priorities are clear: shift from an integration focus to execution focus, deliver better client experiences, capture the significant IRM and revenue synergy potential we have to shift the millions of hours of development training and effort from the integration to building better lives for our clients. This shift does not require any incremental risk appetite or capital. It only requires execution and focus. At the same time, while we believe the economy is on sound footing in the near term, the headwinds of geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with the inflationary environment and aggressive forecast for the tightening of monetary policy create a wide range of economic outlook as we move further into this year and next. Truist is well positioned across all of these environments, given our advice-oriented model for our clients, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix and strong and improving earnings profile. And with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you. Yes. Maybe I'll do it in two ways, and maybe I'll do it in -- starting with the tangible side. If you look at production and pipeline specifically, they're really strong. Our pipelines particularly in that core commercial business, which you're talking about in the first quarter are equal to where they were in the fourth quarter in terms of strength. So in terms of the evidence of what we see in terms of pipelines and production, I'd say there still is a great deal of confidence. Virtually every client is in some inventory build capacity. I mean from a supply chain perspective, they're all wishing to increase their inventory to serve an increasing demand. Demand does not seem to be the particular challenge. So I'd say that's the tangible part. Now the intangible part in talking to clients, sort of where everybody is and what some of the anecdotal evidence, I don't think we're in a full risk-off mode, but there's a little bit of a wait and see. I mean, I think that's fair. Maybe a little bit of a blinking yellow light, not a red light, nobody's stopping. So I think the combination of this tangible part that we see in terms of pipeline production, need for inventory build is really solid and would be reasons to be really optimistic all with just a little bit of a cautionary note as people look forward into the next several quarters. Yes. So I think to bump those comments, I mean, there's reason to have a lot of optimism with just a slight level of uncertainty, which sort of is the right balance. And that's what I might add to that, we're operating now as a new Truist. So we're operating with a company that has about an 18% average market share. So in number one, two or three market share in most of our markets. So that's a new experience. Also this increased capacity and marketing expense. So our unaided brand awareness has really gone up actually fairly significantly since the rollout. And then we just have a lot more capabilities other than rate pay. I mean we just have a lot more tools and capabilities to offer our clients. So, we're operating in the kind of -- this is the kind of environment we built through Truist forward in fairness. We have company that's got that kind of prowess and capability to serve our clients in ways other than just rate paid. Hey, John, it's Bill. Why don't I maybe start on the capital side? I mean, I think we've been very consistent about thinking about where we wanted to establish capital, where we want to operate based on three primary factors. One was just where we were in the merger, how much risk do we have on the merger, do we need to allow additional capital for merger risk. That's obviously come down substantially. I mean, I would consider that sort of be in a normal mode right now, and we don't -- we've gotten through the big components of that really, really successfully. The second is how much economic risk do we have? And we probably have a little more economic risk in fairness than we had a year ago, but I think maybe on the marginal side. And then sort of where we fit from risk profile as evidenced by some of the CCAR results. And I think will be another confirmation of our lower risk profile, higher PPNR model as Truist. So, those are the three things that we put into the mixing bowl as it relates to capital. And we'll continue to reevaluate that. We feel very comfortable where we are right now. We'll reevaluate that in the mid part of this year and try to determine the appropriate place for Truist to operate. But I feel like we've got a lot of opportunity in the capital side based on the evaluation of those risks. And Daryl, would you answer the other part of that question. Yes. I'd say, Matt, I mean -- yes, Matt, we're on really good track on the cost saves. I mean, we're ahead in most of the categories where we want to be. And now we've got a couple of remaining big chunky ones and they're binary. You close the data center and you get the cost saves. I mean, so we feel really good about where we are in that trajectory. Yes. I think, Matt, if we think about sort of overall for Truist, what we expect to be a low efficiency ratio company. So I think the construct of our business mix and our structure allows us to be a low-efficiency industry-leading low efficiency ratio company, sort of where that ends on an absolute basis will depend on a lot of market conditions, but we'll be at the low end of that. We will be a company with higher growth potential and less volatility. So I mean when we think about how expenses fit into that rather than sort of the absolute dollar amount in light of expenses that support a growing business and being able to do that with, I think, an industry-leading low efficiency ratio. And positive operating leverage. And maybe I showed you asked that I want to make sure I make that clear as well. Okay. We're going to assume we're on the auto bot. We have no speed limits in terms of opportunity. And Mike, we're at that inflection point. I mean we talked about this. This is -- I think we're right at that pivot point. And I can feel it. I mean I can feel all the things if you categorize loan growth. But if we break it down to, I think, the things that are highly correlated to positive trajectory, I think those areas where actually we're doing well, things like sort of core C&I. Other decisions on loan growth are related to the decisions we've made about positioning our company, which I think will be really beneficial to us long term. And then I look at sort of the pivot points of, I mean, I'll pick several categories if I look at integrated relationship management. It wasn't at the level we needed it to be in sort of the fourth quarter, first quarter, we've made the pivot point, and we're starting to see significant increase, and you'll start to see that in some of our results. You see that a little bit in the insurance results in this quarter where we are in terms of positive asset flow and wealth, wealth teams and insurance teams net positive in terms of adding people. So we've reached sort of really good inflection points there. Investment banking, clearly, in terms of adding, retaining opportunities in those businesses, things like the core commercial pipelines, where we are in terms of more lead deals more on the left side, where we are positioned in terms of production in the places we want to be. So I can feel the inflection point. So maybe we're -- whatever it was 60 miles an hour, but the foot is on the accelerator, not the brake. And I totally feel that in the transition that we're making at this particular juncture, and I'm very confident about our positioning for the future. Jeff, I look at my personal calendar, I don't think I've been in Charlotte in the last five weeks or so. I mean, so I look at all of our leaders' time in terms of where they're spending time, and there's a significant difference. I've been much more in front of teammates, in front of clients and community. And just my own personal time, I can feel it. And in fairness, I'm just one symbol. More teammates have been in that mode for a longer period of time than I have, and we feel that power shift. I mean just thinking about it in a simple way and Daryl was talking about it in a simple way, we did about 0.5 million hours worth of training. So just maybe put that in context of which that 0.5 million hours of training, we now translate into 0.5 million hours of client-related activity just as like one symbol. Yes. And then on the core conversion, I mean, we consolidated to our heritage core platform but that doesn't really sort of explain the next-gen opportunities we have within that. So you think about the use of cloud-based and API technologies to create, for example, the digital experience, which we've talked about. So this concept of a digital straddle, we were able to convert add flexibility and add products and capabilities to our clients digitally long before we converted them physically in the core conversion. So I think we've got a really good strong first second-gen core platform with third gen, fourth gen kind of capabilities that sit on top of that. And then as you know, we're also experimenting with a new core platform for LightStream. So, I think we've got our feet in the right place where we want to be in terms of maximum flexibility listing core and experimenting with a new core with LightStream and a product called FinSac, which we've talked about before. And this digital straddle agility I think will really, really pay strong dividends for us going forward. Yes. Clarke, do you mind you talk about..."

            "name": "Daryl Bible",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income decreased 2% sequentially as the impact of two fewer days and lower purchase accounting accretion offset the benefits of solid loan growth and higher securities yields. Reported net interest margin was flat and core net interest margin increased 2 basis points both exceeding our guidance by 2 basis points. The improvement in core net interest margin was primarily driven by lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. Moving to Slide 13. Truist has intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, being well positioned to benefit from higher rates in the near-term while maintaining some level of downside protection if and when interest rates decline. We continue to be asset sensitive and estimate a 100 basis point ramp rate increase would increase NII by 4.3%, a 100 basis point shock would increase NII by 7.3%. Approximately 80% of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve. While early, deposit betas thus far are tracking below modeled expectations. Moving to Slide 14. Adjusted revenue declined 4.4% linked quarter, which is below our guidance range of down 1% to 2% and driven almost entirely by weaker-than-expected fee income. Fees declined 8% sequentially and reflecting challenging market conditions and seasonality. Investment banking and trading income declined $116 million or 31% as more volatile market conditions impacted M&A, high yield, leverage finance and equity. Investment banking pipelines look healthy, but market conditions will determine both how much and when the pipeline is realized. Residential mortgage income declined $70 million or 44% as higher interest rates reduced refinance activity and pressured gain on sale margins on the production side. Servicing was not as large of an offset as expected since the benefits of slowing DK were eroded by higher hedging costs due to the flatter yield curve. Part and payment fees and service charges on deposits declined $33 million collectively primarily driven by seasonal but also due to client-friendly fee waivers we instituted in and around the time of our February conversion. These items were partially offset by insurance income, which increased 9% primarily due to strong organic growth and the first month of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. We included a table at the bottom of Slide 14 to make other income trends more clear. Other income, excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and other gains was up $31 million sequentially given negative valuation adjustment for Visa-related derivative last quarter and up $56 million year-over-year primarily as a result of higher SBIC income. Turning to Slide 15. Reported expenses were $3.7 billion, including $216 million of merger-related costs and $202 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The merger costs in the quarter were primarily connected to new Truist signs, branch closings and impairments and data center decommissioning efforts. Adjusted expenses decreased sequentially, exceeding our guidance of up 1% to 2% and reflecting our disciplined expense management. The drivers of the decline include decreased personnel costs, reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and changes to the nonqualified plan, partially offset by seasonally higher FICA and 401(k) expenses. The decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by increased marketing costs as we continue building our brand. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, adjusted expenses were stable as cost saves from FTE reductions and lower occupancy costs were offset by continued investments in software and marketing, along with higher operational losses. The operational losses have steadily increased in recent quarters as banks are experiencing higher levels of fraud activity, in addition to our own decisions to enhance client experience. We remain highly focused on reducing our operational losses and improving our client experience at the same time. Overall, we have incurred significant costs in conjunction with the integration events, both in the merger categories as well as run rate fees and expenses. We were excited that our last major conversion event is behind us, and we can start to reduce the financial costs associated with these integrations. Moving to Slide 16. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio and favorable economic conditions. Our net charge-off ratio for the first quarter was unchanged at 25 basis points. The ALLL ratio decreased to 1.44%, resulting in a provision benefit of $95 million first quarter. Our reserve levels reflect current credit conditions but also take into account uncertainty associated with inflation, rising rates and geopolitical events. Truist has no direct credit exposure to Russia or Ukraine and minimal indirect exposure. Including RAC, our exposure to subprime at the origination is 1% or less in the other consumer portfolios. Continuing on Slide 17. Capital and liquidity levels remain strong. Our CET1 ratio declined approximately 20 basis points as a result of capital deployments related to the acquisitions of Kensington Vanguard and certain merchant service relationships, growth in risk-weighted assets and the CECL phase-in. In order to mitigate ACI risk and volatility, we transferred approximately 40% of the securities portfolio to held to maturity during the first quarter. Because we are a Category 3 institution, AOCI does not impact regulatory capital, it simply impacts tangible common equity. We submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early April and look forward to sharing more details later this summer. Moving to Slide 18. This slide provides additional details about three transactions we completed in the first quarter to enhance our future earnings and profitability. First, Kensington Vanguard acquisition significantly expands our presence in title insurance, augments our capabilities in larger and more complex commercial transactions and will also provide additional IRM opportunities given our significant presence in CRE. We anticipate Kensington Vanguard will add $115 million in revenue annually and be accretive to insurance EBITDA margin by year two. Second, we terminated merchant revenue share alliance in which Truist had a non-controlling interest. The transaction resulted in a $74 million gain from marking our stake to fair value. In addition, we acquired significant portion of relationships from this alliance. This will position us to control more of the end client experience when serving those clients. We also believe that the acquisition will generate approximately $25 million of additional cash, PPNR annually. Last, we repositioned $3 billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately 100 basis points resulting in a two-year payback. Moving to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned, we successfully completed our large core bank conversion in February. We are now One Truist, not just culturally, but also in terms of branding, digital and technology, which allows us to serve our clients more effectively and make our company simpler to operate. As we shift our focus from integration to executional excellence, we will maintain our focus on realizing remaining cost savings. Much of that will happen in the second half of '22 as we decommission over 900 business applications and three of our six data centers. Our decommissioning efforts are complex and significant, and we are on track. With our final integration largely complete, our technology teams will shift towards more further enhancing client and teammate experience. Turning to Slide 21. We have made excellent progress across the five cost-save buckets and are closing in on our commitment to achieve $1.6 billion in net cost saves. Third-party spend is down 11.9% from baseline levels exceeding our targeted reduction of 10%. This quarter, we closed over 400 branches exceeding our commitment to close over 800 total branches by the end of the first quarter of 2022. We now have finished the merger-related branch reduction efforts and will shift to more normal course branch network optimization. We have also achieved our targeted reduction in non-branch facility space, strategically reducing our occupancy costs through consolidation and closures. However, we still have more opportunities in which we are working. Excluding acquisitions average FTEs are down 1% linked quarter and 14% since the merger. Our voluntary separation and retirement program will conclude in the next two quarters, further supporting our ongoing cost saving efforts. I will now provide guidance for the full year '22 and new guidance for the second quarter. In 2022, we now expect adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4% from 2021. Relative to our outlook from January, the mix of revenue growth is now tilted more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by weaker fees, primarily in residential mortgage and investment banking. This represents 6% to 7% core revenue growth when you exclude significant decline in PPP and purchase accounting. As you will recall, we expect a mid-single-digit decline in service charges in 2022 given our elimination of certain overdraft-related fees and introduction of Truist One Banking. NII and net interest margin bottomed in the first quarter and should increase throughout the year based on the forward curve. We continue to expect point-to-point loan growth ex-PPP in the mid-single digits. But as Bill said, we acknowledge higher levels of economic uncertainty. We will be at the high end of our 1% to 2% increase of adjusted noninterest expense largely due to the impact of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. The first quarter was the peak for our merger-related costs, and now we are projecting less than $400 million for the rest of this year and none in 2023. We are still targeting positive operating leverage on a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2022, though this is somewhat dependent on interest rates and market conditions. We still expect net charge-off ratio to be in the 30 to 40 basis points given our assumptions for normalization throughout the year. Looking into the second quarter, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow high single digit with possible upside from the first quarter level. As a result, higher net interest income and much longer fee income given seasonality in insurance and the potential rebound of investment banking, this outlook assumes the forward curve in interest rates and controlled deposit betas. We expect core net interest margin to increase approximately 7 to 10 basis points due to the benefits from the March hike and from a projected 50 basis point hike in May. GAAP net interest margin is expected to increase only 3 to 4 basis points as purchase accounting accretion is slowing, given lower prepayment environment as a result of higher rates. Now I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude. Gerard, let me start on the loan growth and maybe sort of cover a variety of different topics in your question. We're seeing interesting loan growth and I think the places that most highly correlate to performance, I think, is where we're performing well. So, I think C&I as an example. So in C&I, if you exclude PPP, where remember, we were over-indexed appropriately, you exclude the mortgage warehouse component, which has a lot of seasonal components to it, it sort of dissected to core C&I, it was up about a little over 5%. So we think that actually reflects the core component of where we see loan growth and the power and the execution of our franchise. That was particularly strong and literally across all of our business lines that was good across virtually all of our geographies areas like asset finance and ABL, sort of geared supply chain were particularly strong. You asked about CRE, and I'd say it's a couple of different stories. On the small CRE side, we have had some runoff. Some of that's been intentional in the focused areas. On the sort of higher-end institutional borrowers, we actually performed very well. We've been very competitive on the residential and industrial side, particularly think specialized areas like data centers and those types of those types of things. Clients are flying portfolios. But it is an aggressive market. So I think the places where we want to be competitive, we're really competitive in the areas that we've allowed a little runoff, we've allowed a little runoff to happen there. Daryl, do you want to talk specifically about -- I think there was a question about the refi? Yes. On the residential, Gerard, about two-thirds of our activity was in refinance activity. That has really come down significantly. As we move to the second quarter, it's more of a purchase market kind of plays to our strength from that perspective. So I think we're hopeful that, that will kind of maintain and hopefully build as the year goes on, but refi is definitely being impacted. The other impact on the residential mortgage is just the cost of hedging is just a lot higher right now. So, it's offsetting some of the servicing benefit that you would get out there. The only thing I would add to that, on the consumer side, it's fair to say in February during the conversion our branch people were really distracted just going through the integration and the efforts. I think we've come out of that strong now, and we're starting to see momentum in loan origination out of the branch areas. And if you look at our consumer convenience businesses that we have like LightStream and Sheffield and Service Finance, they're all starting off really strong and seeing really good volumes as we enter into the second quarter. Yes, Betsy, I think what you're looking at, we can maybe check off the line, but I think it's just the runoff of purchase accounting. When you look at our new rates going on the books, our new volume rates are going on higher than what the existing portfolio is right now. So, we are averaging up in most cases across the board there. So, I think overall, yields will rise and when we have our projections throughout the year, I expect net interest margin to continue to rise throughout the year, NII to continue to grow just as the interest rates start to climb. If you look at what we've attracted from COVID, $80-plus billion of new deposit funding, the vast majority of that is noninterest-bearing. And when you look at it, we pay the lowest rates of anybody else in the industry. So almost all of it is non-rate sensitive. So we definitely feel that we have betas modeled in to protect what we want to protect out there. There could be a little bit of ebb and flow. But for the most part, we will be specific to make sure that we protect our good clients throughout the organization and do that. But right now, we've had rates just started to lift off and our deposit betas that we're seeing right now are coming in much less than what we modeled. It's very early into this. But I think right now, I think it's not a huge impact on what we've had to pay and we still have the deposits growing for us, so non-interest-bearing growth from us in this past quarter as well. Yes. So I think the way we are managing the balance sheet, and we've talked about this before is, right now, we are targeting $15 billion to $20 billion of balances at the Fed. Since the war started in the first quarter, we're tilted a little bit towards the heavier side of that just for liquidity purposes. And you really look at the cash flows of the whole balance sheet in total. So we've had deposit growth come in, so that's a positive inflow. You have runoff of securities. That's a positive inflow. Our first priority is to lend it out to our clients and to basically do that. Once we've done what we can do from a lending perspective, then the residual piece would basically go into the securities portfolio. Now from a securities portfolio perspective, we're investing in the past in treasuries, MBS. So, those are very high-grade, very secure-type securities. So yes, the mix of what you're doing, if you go into treasuries, it isn't a forecast, Treasuries are in the 270s, 280s between the three- to five-year area. MBS are approaching 4%. So, it'll blend there. But I would say, we'd be on the shorter end of that on a duration perspective, but all that is incorporated with the guidance we gave you. Yes. So on the OCI, John, what I would tell you is Category 3 it's not in our regulatory capital numbers. 99% of our portfolio is guaranteed. So it's just a matter of timing. We're going to get the funding back. It's not a permanent impairment that you see. There are partial offsets once a year you mark your pension plan that Mark will obviously be against what the OCI is, which would be some benefit at 12/31. But the real hedge when you really look at this is the economic hedge with deposits. I mean deposits have increased in value. We don't mark to market these non-maturity deposits, but we really look at it. The value of that has well exceeded the adjustment than what you saw on the securities portfolio. So that's really, I think, the offset that you see there. If we wanted to, we could put more than 40% into held to maturity, I don't think we're there yet where we need to do that from that perspective. I think we feel good with what we've done today. About 6.5%, and our modeling, even with rates going up higher is basically capped out. So, we're really in the six handle, and that's where it's going to be until rates start to fall again. Yes. Matt, what I would say, it's pretty minimal. I mean we had a little bit more reduction in VSRP at the beginning of the quarter. Most of the branch closures were back-end loaded in the quarter. Some of the technology savings that's going to come through that's really all in the second half. We have a little bit more closures in corporate real estate. So, I would say, it's much more back-end loaded. We maybe got a little bit, but the vast majority of it would be in the second half of '22. That's right. Yes. So, we were two-thirds of the way through at the end of the year. We made a little bit of progress in the first quarter, and we got more to do in the second half of '22. Roughly, I would say $400 million to $500 million, Mike, because we got a little bit of savings in the first quarter. Yes, John, you kind of go back where we were when we announced this transaction back in '19. Rates were a couple of hundred basis points higher back then. And at that point, we thought if we got those cost saves, we would be able to come in at the low 50s at that point. We're definitely a different company. We continue to buy and add businesses and all that. But we definitely have at least a forecast from the Fed for it to go up a couple basis points this year and into 2023. So assuming you get the Fed up to 3%, 3.5% and we will execute on our cost saves, we should have really strong efficiency ratios coming in. Whether we get low 50s or not, I think there's a shot that that could happen just because of the asset sensitivity that we have in the Company and what we're seeing in the marketplace, our deposit beta is how they perform. So no guarantees from that perspective, but rates going up definitely helps on the net interest income side significantly, and it's back to kind of where we were back in '19. Yes. So from a cost save perspective, obviously, technology is the biggest chunk of where the cost savings would come in. So that would be the majority of the savings, both data centers, application systems, FTEs, all in that area would basically will be cost savings. We still have more to do on -- a little bit on the VSRP that will help benefit. You have more on corporate real estate reductions. So, we have other savings. So I would say overall, now that we've moved from the integration to now running and operating the Company, we will continue to look for more efficiencies as we operate the Company to give us more fuel to make more investments in the Company as we move forward from that perspective. And I'll put it back to Bill. Yes. So a lot of moving parts there. What I would say is that in spirit, I think using a good gauge with a gradual over 200, I think is a good approximation. The deposit betas we talked about earlier, we have those being phased in and that's built into these numbers. So, we're expecting 25% the first 100, 35 and the next 150 after that. Right now, we're performing better than that. But we definitely have a pickup in trajectory. If this forward curve does play out as what's embedded in there you will see a big increase in both core net interest margins from where we are today, probably peers seen 3% maybe by the end of the year. I think we have good conservative estimates. So, there is a chance for outperformance, but it's still very early, Erika. So you don't really know. But I feel pretty good with these projections and feel good. Bill talked about earlier about our deposit base and our clients and density that we have. So, I think we're going to have really positive net interest income as this year plays out in the '23."

            "name": "Clarke Starnes",
            "content": "Yes, Ebrahim, what I would say is that the area we're most focused on from the consumer standpoint around of more path to normalization or any potential stress out there with the inflationary pressures would be in our subprime auto book. Remember, that book is less than $5 billion to high return business. So, we are watching that really closely. And so, we're seeing the credit performance more normalized there. I would say, for the remaining consumer segments, we principally have a prime-based portfolio. So, less than 1% or so of our borrowers in those segments would be considered non-prime, so it's just not as big of an issue there, but I would say our expectations are that you'll continue to see as we go through the rest of the year. More normalization on the consumer side first and where we're watching most closely would be the lower income consumer in our subprime auto. Sure. And just to remind you all, our day one CECL was at 154 and at Q2 level now is at 144. So it's down 9 bps from the first quarter. And so, the other point I would make to you is our reserve coverage is even at that level, are very strong to NCOs and NPAs. So, the way we think about CECL, we continue to incorporate multiple economic scenarios and the estimate, including maintaining a pretty healthy weighting on our downside case. We also, this quarter, considered qualitatively in precision and uncertainty with respect to inflationary pressures, rate increases in the war in Ukraine. But remind you, I'd also reflected the outstanding performance we had from a risk profile and a credit performance for the quarter. So all that being said, we still anticipate potentially additional reserves in '22, but probably at a decelerated pace compared to last year. And I would just say this, obviously, the number and the amount of the releases is really dependent upon how the economic situation unfolds. Katie, we have time for one more question."

Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Brad Milsaps.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO Bill Rogers and our CFO Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's fourth quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions, and provide an updated outlook for 2024. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair and Chief Operating Officer; Donta Wilson, Chief Consumer and Small Business Banking Officer; and John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings Chairman and CEO are also in attendance and available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information, are available on the Truist Investor Relations website ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review these disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Brad and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our fourth quarter results, let's begin with our purpose on slide four. As you know, Truist is a purpose-driven company committed to inspiring and building better lives in communities. I'd like to take just a few moments to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose during 2023. Through Truist Community Capital, we committed nearly $2.1 billion to support more than 15,000 units of affordable housing. This helped create more than 15,000 jobs and serve more than 130,000 people in low and modern income communities this year. Also, our teammates impacted 5,300 organizations and causes through their charitable giving and more than 62,000 hours of volunteer service. In addition, we started a small business community heroes initiative, which empowers our branch teammates alongside our virtual small business specialist leveraging our digital solutions to proactively connect via caring conversations with small business owners, who tirelessly work to serve our neighbors, create jobs, build our communities, and help drive our economy. So those are just a few examples of the meaningful work we're doing as a company to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients, our teammates, our communities, and our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. All right, so let's turn to some of the key takeaways on slide six. Truist reported solid fourth quarter results, adjusted earnings after excluding several discrete items that impacted our results. The largest of these items, of course is a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. Mike's going to provide more details later in our call, but this is the result of our annual impairment test, which we conduct each year as of October 1. So importantly, this is -- charge is non-cash, it has no impact on our liquidity, regulatory capital ratios, the payment of our common dividend, or our ability to do business and serve our clients. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income of $1.1 billion or $0.81 a share, which excludes the impact of the impairment charge, the industry-wide FDIC special assessment, and a discrete tax benefit. In addition, pre-tax merger related and restructuring charges of $183 million negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.10 per share. Most of these charges were related to our cost saving plan. Despite these discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we made strong progress on our organization simplification plan during this quarter. Since these initiatives were announced in mid-September, we've reduced headcount, relined significant elements of our organizational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities in 2024 and beyond. As a result of these efforts and others through 2023, the fourth quarter marks the second consecutive quarter we've seen our expenses decline. Although the first quarter will experience typical seasonal expense headwinds, we're on track and fully committed to delivering on the cost initiatives that we outlined in September, which will limit adjusted expense growth to flat to up to 1% in 2024, while also continuing to invest in initiatives for our core clients, technology, and risk management. Although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels, we're encouraged that non-performing loans decline during the quarter, while we continue to build our loan loss reserve considering the uncertain economic environment. Consistent with our capital planning strategy, our CET1 ratio increased 20 basis points sequentially to 10.1. Although we're committed to building capital, our balance sheet also remains open to core clients as our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing clients and the payment of our common dividend. So before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail, let me provide a quick update on our progress we're making on improving the experiences for our clients, we'll do that on slide seven. Truist continues to see improved digital engagement trends with strong transaction growth over the last year. Mobile app users grew 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, which is contributing to increased transaction volumes, which now account for 62% of total bank transactions. As shown in the chart on the left, growth in digital transactions is primarily reflected by increased Zelle usage as clients continue to value efficient payment and money movement capabilities. While this is certainly positive, Truist still has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital, specifically by leveraging our T3 strategy, which is the concept that touch and technology work together to create trust. That further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency. Our goal is to create seamless experiences for our clients by offering more self-service capabilities to enhance the overall client experience. Truist Assist is a perfect example of this concept. Since launching in 2022, we've seen increased client adoption with one-third of the total interactions represented in the fourth quarter of 2023 alone. Additionally, 85% of the conversations were completed using the automated assistant this quarter. As we look into 2024 we expect accelerated adoption of Truist Assist, which should lead to additional operational efficiencies for Truist. Overall, I'm pleased with the digital progress we've made in 2023 and excited about the opportunity to further leverage T3 in 2024 and beyond that. So let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Mike?\nMike Maguire: Great, thank you Bill and good morning everyone. For the quarter we reported a GAAP net loss of $5.2 billion or $3.85 per share. As Bill noted reported earnings per share were impacted by several items detailed at the top of slide eight. Those include a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.1 billion, a special FDIC assessment of $507 million, and a discrete tax benefit of $204 million. Excluding these three items, adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $0.81 per share. In addition, merger-related and restructuring charges, primarily related to severance and branch consolidation associated with our call-saves initiatives, negatively impacted EPS by another $0.10. Before providing further details on this quarter's underlying financial performance, I do want to provide some additional background on the goodwill impairment charge that occurred during the quarter. We test our goodwill for impairment annually on October 1. This year's test resulted in an impairment of $6.1 billion. The impairment was primarily driven by the continued impact of higher interest rates and higher discount rates and a sustained decline in banking industry share prices, including Truist share price. Importantly, as Bill noted in his opening remarks, this is a non-cash charge and has no impact on our liquidity, no impact on our regulatory capital ratios, our ability to pay our common stock dividend or to serve the needs of our clients. Moving on to the results for the quarter. Total revenue increased 50 basis points sequentially due to a more modest decline in net interest income than expected. Adjusted expenses declined 4.5% or 5.2%, if excluding the impact of TIH Independence Readiness Costs. Our net interest margin improved 3 basis points to 2.98% during the quarter. We added 20 basis points to CET1 capital in the quarter and increased our ALLL ratio by 5 basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty. Finally, our tangible book value per share increased 13% on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to the impact of lower interest rates on the value of our available for sale investment portfolio. Next, we'll turn to page nine to cover loans and leases. Average loans decreased 1.7% sequentially, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts and overall weaker client demand. Average commercial loans decreased 1.8%, primarily due to a 2.3% decrease in CNI balances, primarily due to lower client demand. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased 1.8%, primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage. Overall, we expect average commercial and consumer balances decline modestly in the first quarter driven by our ongoing mix shift toward deeper client relationships, deemphasizing lower return portfolios, and the effects of continued economic uncertainty. Moving now to deposit trends on slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1.4% sequentially as growth in time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in non-interest-bearing and money market balances. Non-interest-bearing deposits decreased 3.7% and represented 29% of total deposits, compared to 30% in the third quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the quarter, consumers continued to seek higher rate alternatives, which drove an increase in deposit costs, albeit at a slower pace relative to recent periods. Typically, total deposit costs increased 9 basis points sequentially to 1.90%, down from a 30 basis point increase in the prior quarter, which resulted in just a 100 basis point increase to our cumulative total deposit beta to 36%. Similarly, interest bearing deposit costs increased 10 basis points, sequentially to 2.67%, down from a 38 basis point increase in the prior quarter, which also resulted in a 100 basis point increase to our cumulative total interest bearing deposit beta to 50%. Going forward, we will continue to maintain a balanced approach, focusing on core relationships, staying attentive to client needs, and striving to maximize the value we can add to relationships outside of rate paid. Moving the net interest income and net interest margin on slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 0.6% linked quarter due to lower average earning assets and higher rate paid on deposits partially offset by favorable hedge income. Reported net interest margin improved 3 basis points on a linked basis quarter. While net interest margin expanded in each of the last two quarters, we expected to contract in the first quarter due to an increase in rate paid on deposits partially offset by continued improvement and spreads on new and renewed loans. Turning the non-interest income on slide 12. Fee income increased $47 million or 2.2% relative to the third quarter. The linked quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher service charges on deposits, which were up $76 million in the fourth quarter, due primarily to the third quarter being impacted by $87 million of client refunds. Lending-related fees increased $51 million linked quarter, due to higher leasing related gains. And other fees declined $66 million due to lower equity income. Fee income was down 3.2% on a like quarter basis as lower investment banking and trading, deposit service charges, mortgage banking and other income were partially offset with higher insurance income and higher lending related fees. Next I'll cover non-interest expense on slide 13, GAAP expenses of $10.3 billion increased 6$.5 billion linked quarter due primarily to the previously mentioned $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge, the $507 million FDIC special assessment, and a $108 million increase in merger-related restructuring expense, partially offset by a $183 million decline in personnel costs. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense declined 4.5% sequentially or 5.2%, excluding the impact of $33 million of TIH independence readiness costs. The decrease in adjusted expense was driven by lower personnel expense due to the execution of our cost savings program, resulting in headcount reductions, as well as lower incentive compensation to reflect our performance in 2023. These improvements were partially offset with higher professional and outside processing expenses. Adjusted non-interest expenses were essentially flat on a light-quarter basis. As Bill mentioned, we are pleased with the progress that we've made on the cost savings initiative that we announced in September. Our original goal was to eliminate or avoid expenses of approximately $750 million over a 12 to 18 month period, which would help us manage our expense growth in 2024 to flat to up 1%. The largest category of savings targeted in our plan was a reduction in force driven by a company-wide assessment of spans and layers of management, the elimination of redundant functions, and the restructuring of certain business lines. We've made significant progress here. FTEs are down 4% from June 30 to December 31 with the final set of reductions underway in the first quarter. The second category we highlighted included cost savings opportunities that would be driven by organizational simplification. Examples include reimagining our go-to-market strategy and CRE, simplifying our benefits programs, and right sizing our branch network and related staffing. As part of these efforts, we anticipate reducing the size of our branch footprint by nearly 4% during the first-half of 2024. In addition to lowering headcount and simplifying our organization, we also reexamined our technology investment spend. Through this process, we have rationalized, rescoped, or delayed the start of a number of projects primarily in non-core areas. We estimated restructuring costs related to this initiative to be approximately $225 million or 30% of our initial $750 million goal. So far, we have incurred around $200 million of charges related to the program, mostly driven by reductions in force in the facilities-related decisions. We would expect to recognize the bulk of the remaining costs in the first quarter. It's clear to state here that the work is never done and we continue to assertively manage costs. But we feel confident that we will achieve our flat to up 1% expense target for 2024. Okay, moving on to asset quality on slide 14. Asset quality metrics continue to normalize in the fourth quarter, but overall remain manageable. Non-performing loans declined 6% linked quarter, while early stage delinquencies increased 11 basis points sequentially due to an increase in 30 to 89 day past due consumer and C&I loans. Included in our appendix is an updated data on our office portfolio represents 1.7% of total loans. We are pleased that non-performing and criticizing classified office loans decreased modestly linked quarter, while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from 8.3% at September 30 to 8.5% at year end. During the quarter our net charge off ratio increased 6 basis points to 57 basis points. The increase in net charge offs for the quarter reflects increases on our other consumer, indirect auto and C&I lending portfolios partially offset by lower CRE losses. We continued to build reserves as provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by $119 million. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.54%, up 5 basis points sequentially, and 20 basis points year-over-year, due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we've tightened our risk appetite in select areas, though we remain -- maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality long-term clients. Turning now to capital on slide 15. Truist added 20 basis points of CET1 capital in the fourth quarter through a combination of organic capital generation, disciplined RWA management, and this quarter's tax benefit, partially offset by the FDIC special assessment. With a CET1 ratio of 10.1%, Truist remains well-capitalized relative to our minimum regulatory requirement of 7.4% that became effective on October 1. We remain committed to building capital and do not have plans to repurchase shares over the near-term. We continue to be disciplined with our RWA management strategy as we allocate less capital to certain businesses, though we have been clear that our balance sheet remains open to core clients. Our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing core clients, as well as the payment of our $0.52 per share quarterly dividend. In addition, we continue to believe that Truist\u2019s capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings is a distinctive advantage. We estimate that our residual 80% ownership stake provides greater than 200 basis points of additional capital flexibility and we continue to evaluate our strategic options with respect to TIH. The table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our AOCI at year-end. During the fourth quarter, the component of AOCI attributable to securities declined from $13.5 billion to $11.1 billion or by $2.4 billion due to the decline in long-term interest rates during the quarter and finished 2023 essentially flat when compared to year-end 2022. AOCI related to our pension plan improved from $1.5 billion to $1.1 billion, which is a level that will remain static throughout 2024. Based on estimated cash flows in today's forward curve, we would expect the component of AOCI attributable to securities to decline from $11.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter to $8 billion by the end of 2026 or by approximately 28%. We continue to feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements and build capital under the proposed phase and periods based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules. We have refined our estimate for the impact to risk-weighted assets under Basel III and now expect a mid-single-digit increase in risk-weighted assets, compared to our previous estimate of a high-single-digit increase. Finally, as it relates to the proposed rules for a long-term debt requirement, we estimate the Truist binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately $12 billion. We remain confident that we will be able to meet the proposed requirement at both the bank and the holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phase-in period. As part of our regular way funding plan, we issued $1.75 billion of long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2023. All right, I'll now turn to page 16 to review our updated guidance. Looking into the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenues to remain flat or decline by 1% from 4Q 2023 GAAP revenue of $5.8 billion. Net interest income is likely to be down 3% to 4% in the first quarter, which is more than we experienced in the fourth quarter due primarily to one less day, a smaller balance sheet, and some pressure on our net interest margin driven by rate paid. We expect linked quarter improvement in non-interest income due to higher insurance and investment banking and trading income partially offset by lower other and lending related fee income. Adjusted expenses of $3.4 billion are expected to increase by 4%, due to normal seasonal increases related to payroll taxes and higher incentive accruals. For the full-year 2024, we expect revenues to decrease by 1% to 3%. Our balance sheet and interest rate sensitivity continue to be positioned as relatively neutral, which is in line with our long-term goal. Our forecast assumes that net interest income troughs in the first-half of 2024, and then remains relatively stable, assuming five reductions in the Fed funds rate with the first reduction coming in May 2024. In addition, we assume that insurance continues to grow at high-single-digit rate, while investment banking and trading should benefit from a recovery in capital markets. Although we anticipate adjusted expenses rising 4% in the first quarter due to seasonal factors, full-year 2024 adjusted expenses are still expected to remain flat or to increase 1% over 2023 adjusted expenses of $14 billion, which includes TIH Independence Readiness Costs. Our 2024 expense guidance of flat to up 1% also includes $85 million of TIH independence readiness costs. In terms of asset quality, we expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points, reflecting a continued normalization of loss rates across our consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, a lower denominator from declining loan balances, and our strategy to be proactive in resolving higher-risk portfolios. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis. I'll now turn it back to Bill for some final remarks.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Mike. So looking back at 2023, I'm really proud of the work our teammates accomplished, which helped accelerate our transformation into a simpler, more profitable company. As I discussed in September, our transformation is centered on improving efficiency and realigning certain aspects of our leadership and operating model within our three current operating segments, wholesale, consumer, and insurance, to increase our efficiency and drive revenue opportunities. In the third quarter, we've realigned and consolidated several lines of business within consumer and wholesale, including creating a single enterprise-wide payments group, consolidating three commercial real estate units into one, and consolidating four consumer lending platforms to leverage technology and capital resources. During the fourth quarter, we announced significant leadership appointments within consumer and wholesale, and we formed a new operating council composed of key business leaders from across the organization. These leaders will help improve accountability, efficiency, and ultimately drive better growth across our platform while controlling risk, all of which are primary benefits of the simplification plan. These strategic organizational changes designed to improve long-term revenue growth are complete, and we're beginning to see the impacts from our cost savings initiative. To that end, and as Mike discussed, our cost saving efforts are going well and reflect the planning and execution that was ongoing throughout 2023. These cost saving efforts are funding important investments in our risk management infrastructure and core businesses, while also helping to offset natural expense growth in other parts of our organization. We accomplished all of this while growing net new deposit accounts, strengthening our balance sheet through organic capital growth, and strategically allocating our capital to core businesses. Looking beyond the fourth quarter, our top priorities for 2024 include growing and deepening relationships with our core clients, leveraging our more efficient platform to gain market share, achieving our expense target, and enhancing Truist\u2019s digital experience through T3, all while building capital and maintaining strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. We believe there's a significant potential to help our clients achieve their financial success by delivering our commercial consumer payments, investment banking, wealth, and insurance capabilities throughout our existing footprint. In investment banking, we've increased our market share across virtually all of our capital markets products. We've seen a significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products, including investment grade, equity capital markets, leverage finance, and asset securitization. In addition, our mind share with clients and our key industry verticals has never been stronger as we continue to expand in new verticals that are primed for growth as capital market activity recovers. For all of our wholesale businesses, recent changes in client coverage strategies should allow us to focus more intently on opportunities in the middle market where we can bring unique perspective given the breadth and depth of our platform, especially in areas like investment banking and payments. We're seeing solid year-over-year growth in CID referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver value-added advice and capabilities to our clients. Truist Wealth, which beginning in 2024, will be part of our wholesale business segment, has seen positive asset flows in 10 of the last 11 quarters. By bringing the Wealth business over to wholesale, we'll go to market as one team to deliver business transition advisory solutions to commercial and corporate clients. In consumer, I'm encouraged that customer satisfaction scores have returned to pre-merger levels. In addition, net new checking account production was positive in 2023 as we added 59,000 new consumer and 53,000 new business accounts. And during the fourth quarter, we acquired more than 114,000 accounts through our digital channel, including 33,000 new to Truist. While the branch network presents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets, we're seeing improvements in productivity due to excellent teammate execution and investments in technology as evidenced by the increase in net new deposit accounts. We're encouraged by this increased productivity, and we'll look to make investments in branches and select key growth markets in 2025 and beyond. So in conclusion, the fourth quarter was solid, but we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future. We view our fourth quarter performance as another step forward in that direction. We're making strong progress on areas on our control including managing our expenses, building capital, and realigning our business, so that it is well positioned to serve new and existing clients as markets recover. We're firmly committed to achieving our expense target in 2024, while we will continue to build and allocate capital towards core clients in our home markets, which we view as a distinctive competitive advantage. This heightened focus will lead to increased franchise and shareholder value over time. Let me close by just thanking our teammates for their incredible purposeful leadership in 2023. Teammates, your focus and commitment fuels our confidence in 2024 and beyond. Thank you. So with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.\nA - Brad Milsaps: Rocco, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up, in order that we may accommodate as many of you as on the call as possible today.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn McDonald: Hi, good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could unpack the outlook for the net interest income in 2024 a little bit, including, you know, the assumptions around deposits and whether taking out some Fed cut assumptions would change the outlook and how sensitive they are? Thanks.\nMike Maguire: Yes. Good morning, John. No problem, so I guess if you think about \u201824 NII, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we've got five cuts in our base plan, the first in May, and then really another 25 at each meeting with the exception of November. On balances, you know, we mentioned I think, you know, loans probably a touch of pressure in the first quarter, maybe down less than 1%. And then relatively stable on the C&I side, we see a nice, a more stable outlook for the year on the consumer side, a bit of pressure. Deposits, sort of, picking up where we left off in the fourth quarter, so down call it a 1.5% or so in the first, and then declining, but I think albeit it may be a declining rate over the year. So that's, I think, the primary piece. You know, John, we think about repricing. And I think you've heard from peers as well on this. I mean, probably a bit of caution warranted around the betas. So we think that some of the faster stuff that moved on the way up probably moves fast on the way down, but there's still going to be a considerable amount of repriced lag. And so I guess those are the fundamentals. And then I guess you asked about cuts and whether there were fewer. I think we mentioned we're relatively neutral versus our base case on the five cuts. So whether there are three or four, maybe six or seven cuts, I think we have less sensitivity there. That being said, I think it's an area where there are no cuts, you know, that would be, or significantly delayed cuts, that would be a headwind for us.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, and then just a quick one on expenses, the guide for adjusted expenses, you know, in the 14 area. What expenses should we keep in mind for a modeling that are outside that adjusted so that you have some amortization that's usually, I guess, around $500 million and then some merger restructuring expected this year?\nMike Maguire: Yes, and you're right on the amortization that would be excluded. On the Mercs, you know, we mentioned, you know, we've got 25 left on our cost savings initiatives based on estimates in the first quarter. You know, they'll be down versus last year. You know, so, you know, should not be as much noise in \u201824 as we saw in \u201823.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And I guess just other Mercs or incremental operating costs, like any of that throughout the year that we should keep in mind or placeholder for some of that to occur beyond the first quarter?\nMike Maguire: You know, maybe just to touch, John, but I don't expect that to be a significant factor in our \u201824.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, and our next question today comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Thank you. Good morning everybody. Mike, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about sort of how you might see loan demand projecting through the years? Certainly understand and appreciate the comments about a little more pressure on loan balances in the early part of the year? And then more stability, but just curious how you're thinking about whether demand can come back if we begin to get some rate cuts, more macroeconomic clarity, et cetera?\nMike Maguire: Yes, Scott, I think you're right. I think in our base case, we're assuming a couple of things. The five cuts we think will benefit demand a touch, but to the extent that that's underestimated, that would be welcome news. And I think we mentioned from a C&I perspective, we do expect modest growth in that portfolio, at least in the second quarter, third quarter, and beyond. I think most of the pressure that we're seeing for the year is still on the consumer side. Others may weigh in on other factors, Bill?\nBill Rogers: Yes, and it's not just part of the pressure on the consumer side is we're creating, you know, as we're really reducing some of our focus on, you know, indirect as an example. And that's somewhat offset by the growth in Sheffield and Service Finance, but that doesn\u2019t sort of isn't a perfect balance in there. So the consumer reflects probably a little more of our own action and capital allocation than where we are from a market perspective. And then I think as Mike said, I mean, on the C&I side, you know, we're open for business, you know, so, you know, we're going to serve our markets. And I think we've got really, really strong markets. And when I think recovery comes, it will come disproportionately faster in our markets. And if that happens sooner, we'll see the benefit of that. And we'll be a recipient of that, because we are, I think, gaining share in most of those capabilities. And then the other part I just mentioned is that like and when we're winning, we're winning more disproportionately, so on the C&I side particularly, you know, just you know 15% to 20% more of the deals are in left leads as an example. So, you know, if we look at some of our portfolio last year, we're winning more on the left side. So that's got more profitability and more tailwind in terms of an ability to expand those relationships. So I don't know if we're being conservative, to use that word, but I think we've got to sort of see what's in front of us. And hopefully by the end of the year, you know, if the rates turn out as we all forecast, we'll see a little spur in the economy and I think we'll be direct beneficiaries of that.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you. And then, Mike, just a more minutia-oriented one. Obviously great to see the nearly $3 billion improvement in AOC. I'm curious if you have an estimate for what your adjusted or sort of fully loaded common equity Tier 1 ratio is relative to the stated 10.1%?\nMike Maguire: Yes, Scott, I can give that to you. So, you know, on a stated basis, you know, we finished the quarter at 10.1%. You know, if you look at our -- the new balance from an OCI perspective, and this would include the AFS security, as well as the pension, that's about a 2.9% impact. So that would take you down to, you know, call it, I guess 7.2%. And then, you know, the other factors like the thresholds and the RWA inflation we mentioned, you know, earlier in the call that we have done more work around an estimate for what the RWA impact might be under Basel and also a little more work on the thresholds, call those another percent. So that walks you down to low-6s.\nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hey, Bill, I'm wondering if the optimization, maybe you could call it Truist 2.0 is going fast and deep enough, and I do recognize two items. One, you\u2019ve mentioned headwinds in the past from rates, regulation, and retooling. And second, your new efforts, the $750 million savings program, 4% less headcount, 4% less branches ahead. But then I look at the core efficiency numbers, I'm like, oh, this is not what we signed up for, right? I mean, slide eight, nine, I think lists your core efficiency at 59% in 2023, and now you're guiding worse for 2024, and your pre-emerger target was 51%. So are you guys doing enough and doing it fast enough to optimize?\nBill Rogers: Yes, Mike, I think an appropriate challenge is always, we've done a lot. So I think I'm really encouraged by the momentum and you can see it really in the third and fourth quarter. And you see that significantly and particularly the expense declines. And we're committed to what we, you know, what we talked about in September. I think our $750 million plan, I'm really proud of our teammates. I'm proud of our leadership. You know, they really got the sleeves rolled up and got after it. So the intensity that's in this company right now about being more efficient, I feel is demonstrably better. And being able to apply that over this more simplified organizational structures where we see the benefits. So if you think about, as I've made in my comments, I mean sort of that process is complete. So now this intensity, these efforts, these initiatives, we apply that over a much more simplified business model. And the decisions that leaders are making, I think are just better, stronger decisions, which lead us to a more efficient company long-term.\nMike Mayo: My follow-up on optimization, I'll give to my colleague, insurance analyst, Elyse Greenspan. Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes, thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. On the insurance side, I know there's been press reports on the potential monetization and sales process of that asset. So I was just hoping that you can provide, you know, an update to us and just, you know, where you stand with that process?\nBill Rogers: Yes, so I think we've said pretty clearly that, the insurance business creates a capital opportunity for us and then like outlined that in a lot of specificity. We've said clearly that we're always evaluating alternatives and we're going to do the best thing for the insurance business and the best thing for Truist going forward. And I don't think as it relates to any specific timing and those type of things, I don't think I really should comment beyond that.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you.\nBill Rogers: Great, thanks.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you to expand a little bit on your outlook for credit. Noticing the NPA decline this quarter and you have an expected charge off normalization path. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of what areas of the portfolio you're expecting to see that loss trend higher in the most and just your general sense of just how the customer set feels in terms of, you know, that certainly implies a good ramp from here, but one that's controllable. So just kind of juxtaposing that NPA decline with your expected ramp and losses? Thanks.\nClarke Starnes: And this is Clarke. Thanks for the question, our \u201824 NCO guidance, as Mike said, it assumes we're going to continue to see normalization occur, both in consumer and wholesale. We've already seen a lot of it in the consumer side. We have a higher mix, as Bill said, of higher margin consumer finance businesses and less relative mortgage and prime auto, that's a factor on the loss assumption. But I think the biggest one that you\u2019ve pointed out, we're working really hard to get ahead of any potential areas of stress, think CRE office and so our guidance also reflects opportunities to be opportunistic to work through if we see more challenges in that space as that structural risk unfolds. So we hope to do better, but we're assuming we're going to work hard to make sure of that we get ahead of any risk.\nKen Usdin: Thanks, Clarke. And just one follow-up, I'm just wondering, I know you said that you're expecting a hopeful bounce in the investment banking business. Just wondering where those level of conversations are and just given your mix of business, where we might expect to see that either come back sooner or have a lag relative to the environment? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yes, great question. And the good news is we've got a really good balanced investment banking business. So, and, you know, seeing some positive things on, you know, a lot of the different buckets. So if you think about equity capital markets, I mean they're starting to come back. I think we're starting to see some IPO components of that. Our pipeline there is probably the strongest it's been in a long time. And pipeline as active book runner. When and if all that comes to bear, I think that's we'll just have to, that'll be a little bit market dependent. On the debt side, sort of the high yield investment grade, I mean, you've got a lot of maturity sort of running off in \u201824, so there's sort of a natural refinance opportunity. I think, again, sort of that'll be where clients are projecting where they think rates are going to come. So they've got a lot of natural things they have to do and they'll have to pick that point of demarcation where they want to start the refinancing side. And then the M&A pipeline is really strong. We spent a lot of time in energy with our verticals and being really relevant. So the size and scope of some of the things that we're doing are proportionally higher, but we've also built this really great pipeline with our transition advisory business, with our commercial clients. And we've got more in the pipeline there than we closed all of last year, just as an example. So that's sort of that core bread and butter kind of work. And then we have things that were like public finance, which was sort of a nascent business for us 12, 18 months ago, and now starting to build up some momentum and as we see public finance opportunities starting to grow. So we have a lot of cylinders that are working that I think can offset each other and would be a good reason that we would be confident in a pretty nice recovery on the investment banking side. It will be like everything else, a little bit quarter-to-quarter dependent, but hopefully a little less volatility for us given that we've got a lot of cylinders running.\nKen Usdin: Great. Thanks, Michael.\nMike Maguire: Yes.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. The first question is for Bill. Bill, Mike is not saying anything too different about loan growth from the rest of your peers for 2024. That being said, I think obviously one of the genesis of the merger of equals is this combined franchise in this footprint that was better than everybody else's? So I guess my question here is, you know, how much of your current adjusted capital, state right now is sort of impacting still how you're thinking about growth and going to market? And you know, clearly there's going to be a lot of questions on use of proceeds, you know, if you do sell the rest of Truist Insurance Holdings. But how much different is your approach going to be to market, if at all, if you do monetize TIAs?\nBill Rogers: Yes, let me answer the first part of that as well. So, you know, I think that's a great question. And, you know, if you look at sort of the barometer, I was trying to say this earlier on sort of where we go, I think we will reflect our economy and our opportunities. So, and we'll just have to see sort of how that gets unleashed going forward. And I think the correlation will probably be more directly seen in the C&I side, because we're -- as I mentioned before, not just a capital preservation, but or optimization, but really more around optimization around return and sort of looking at our core and non-core. So we've pulled the throttle back on some of the consumer side that we consider to be less capital efficient. So that's got a little bit of an overhang in terms of where we look at this. I think if we go into 2024 and trying to answer your question, I think the barometer for us ought to be on the parts of consumer where we're investing and C&I overall. And as I said earlier, I think when we see the recovery, we'll see it more disproportionately in our markets and we should reflect that. So I think that's exactly right. But the net of your whole question, we're not capital constrained in terms of the opportunity for growth in the business, in poor business, in the places where we're investing.\nErika Najarian: Got it, And just a follow-up question for Mike. One of your peers had framed it this way, so I think the investors found it helpful. But you did mention earlier that you had caution on the betas to the downside, and your first cut is presumed to be May. Considering a lag could you give us a sense of what your range of assumptions is in terms of downside betas for the first 100 basis points of cuts that's embedded in your guide?\nMike Maguire: Yes, Erika, you know, I'm not -- it's a great question, and one we're spending a lot of time on. Look, I mean, I think initially out of the gates, and if these come, call it, you know, \u201825, you know, at a time and you think about the first 100s so the first four for us, I think the first-half of that, it's going to be really pressured by guys still repricing up across the retail business and certain products and segments. So I guess my use of the word cautionary is thinking about kind of where we're ending up right now on a cumulative beta perspective and just acknowledging that we're going to be lower than that out of the gates for certain. But I don't think, if you think about our NII outlook, I think you've got a pretty good sense for how we're thinking about the reprice trend. And we mentioned we think in the first quarter in sort of a static rate environment, we're going to be down 3% to 4% on balances and day count and a touch worse on rate paid. And you know, from there, as we start to see the cuts, in our case, we think we flatten out and are pretty stable.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. I guess, I just wanted to follow-up maybe Bill and Mike on the goodwill charge. I'm assuming it's more than a mathematical exercise and it's hard for me to imagine that higher rates are structurally bad for banking organizations with good deposit base, which is the case for Truist. So to some extent I guess the read-through is some of the deal synergies tied to the SunTrust BB&T merger no longer look as appealing as they did at the time of the deal announcement. One, is am I missing something there? And secondly, Bill, just so you've talked about a bunch of strategic actions, is it fair for us to expect that if we look a year from now, we will see very clearly some of the synergies, be it in terms of market share gains, efficiency tied to the deal where investors can start getting on board with the franchise?\nMike Maguire: Yeah, I'll go on the first one. Ebrahim, thanks for the question. You know, you sort of said, hey, I assume it's sort of not just math, or maybe you said it is mathematical, and that's right. I mean, at the end of the day, we do an annual test for impairment. There are I mean thousands and thousands of factors that go into this work. There are customary evaluation approaches. You know, you evaluate each reporting unit. You know, if you think about it the factors that are significant that we cited in our prepared remarks is that you do have a very you know you've had degradation in operating conditions for the industry you had a significant decline in broadly speaking bank stock valuations, Truist market valuation at the time and we do this test as of a certain day each year. In our case, it's October 1. So all those factors are considered and influence the outcome. But at the end of the day, the estimated fair value is below the carrying value, and that's the output. But again, just to reiterate this, absolutely zero impact to our financial condition or how we think about our opportunity or our strategy or what we're doing.\nBill Rogers: And it's just done by segment too, Mike.\nMike Maguire: Yes, that's right. You look at the various reporting segments, the reporting units for us, which are the consumer and wealth business, at least in \u201823, corporate and commercial, and then insurance.\nBill Rogers: And then on your second question, hopefully, what I was indicating is that process has started. So if you look at the net new account gains we're seeing, the growth in primacy accounts, the growth in market share and investment banking. So those things are actually underway and happening. I think they'll continue to accelerate, they'll continue to build, they'll continue to manifest, as you said, both on the revenue and both on the efficiency side. I think you actually pointed out, you know, you'll see both sides of that.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thanks for that. And just one quick follow-up. When we look at the commercial real estate multifamily book, there are a bunch of like Southeast markets that are probably seeing a fair amount of supply coming through. Any concerns, I mean, what are you seeing in the multifamily CRE today, and any markets where you are particularly focused on in terms of oversupply over the next year or two?\nBill Rogers: Yes, I'll give Clarke to comment as well. But yes, there are, you know, part of the great part of our markets is we have a lot of in-migration. So we've had a lot of building in anticipation of that. So if you think about some of our larger markets, Austin, Orlando, I mean, some of the suspects where you've seen a little bit of that. I'll get Clarke to comment on the quality of the portfolio. So that you know the multifamily, large developers that were in and long-term the migration positive continues. So I was looking at some data interesting enough just to make a comment broadly on that. Within our markets last year, we added a metropolitan Charlotte. So just think about that in context. So we added about 2.2 net in-migration into our market. So the overall demographics are good, but I think in fairness to your question, we probably have a little bit of a shorter term watch item versus worry item. Maybe Clarke, you can\u2026\nClarke Starnes: I agree with you, Bill. Overall, we still think multifamily long-term is a very favorite asset class and some of the current challenges from our perspective relate more to a margin or current debt service coverage risk issue, given rate increases, higher operating cost, and to your point the new pipeline supply that's coming on. And we just view that very differently than the structural risk we see in office as an example. So we're working with our borrowers to address their specific situations as we look out and how they're going to address this impact. Again, so what we would expect more temporary increase in watch lists, some non-accruals, but nowhere near the same loss risk exposure you see in office. And I would remind you that there's very active secondary placement sources, a lot of equity sources willing to come in. And the clients that we have, to Bills point, they want these assets and they're supporting those. So we think it's a manageable risk, even though there's some short-term pressure.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt O'Connor: Hi, good morning. Sorry I missed it, but have you guys talked about what your targeted capital level is? You know, obviously you said going from here with no buybacks in the near-term and again, with the impact on the RWAs from the Basel III and getting proposals, but how are you thinking about targeted capital levels over the medium and long-term? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yes, Matt, for right now, we're at 10.1 in building. And so I think until we get more information, until we sort of understand the dynamics a little bit more and think about our company construct, I think the best thing for us right now is to be in an organic capital building mode. So we haven't set a specific target, but I think 10 plus for the short-term, the medium term seems a good place for us to be landing right now.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. And as you think about kind of the 10 plus medium term, is that including AOCI? Because obviously you're already 10 plus now and you're going to create capital fairly quickly this year with things given earnings and not much balance in growth?\nMike Maguire: Yes, no, Matt, I think we're just, you know, in the moment we're in, you know, we're looking at spot capital, we're thinking about transitioned, you know, capital measurements if we phase into new rules and we're looking at fully phased in. I think the whole industry is thinking about it that way. So I think when Bill thinks about 10, I mean I think about it on a transitional basis, staying at or above 10 is probably what Bill is implying. But I think shorter term is like we're building capital, we're going to continue to do that through organic earnings and hopefully we'll have a little more visibility on this rule and can give you a little better sense for kind of a medium term target.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike. Bill, when we go back to the original merger, I think if I recall correctly, there was a targeted 20% return on tangible common equity and you've just discussed about the capital levels, you know, Basel III being higher than what I presumed to be lower numbers back and when the deal was announced? Can you share with us, are you still thinking 20% return on tangible common equity is a reasonable goal or you can attain it even with these higher capital levels that you and the industry has to carry?\nBill Rogers: Yeah, I mean, I think, Gerard, if we go back to 2019, that was a different world and a different environment, both in terms of, you know, where we were from a rate standpoint and where we were from a capital standpoint, regulatory standpoint. Now we've got Basel III in front of us. So I think in fairness 20, certainly short and medium term is not necessarily in the windshield. But I think we can continue to perform at a high level in terms of ROTCE. And so all the efficiency opportunities and things we're building, revenue growing, those are things that are continuing to build on that. So I think to think about us being a top performer in that category versus setting a specific target that was constructed in 2019 in a different environment is maybe a different way to think about it.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then coming back on -- obviously, you guys talked about credit quality. You referenced, Mike, about commercial real estate in your opening remarks and you just talked about multifamily again. And Truist has always been good on its credit. So my question on commercial real estate in the office area, and maybe this is for Clarke, can you kind of draw a line for us from early \u201822 when there wasn't really any problems before rates started to go higher in downtown office, really, or maybe just emerging? And incrementally, it's clearly deteriorated. Clarke, can you share with us, is the deterioration accelerating on a sequential basis in the office market? Or have we seen the rapid acceleration of down values, real workouts taken charge-offs? And going forward, yes, you're still going to see higher charge-offs probably, but the actual incremental deterioration is lessening or worsening, can you share with us from that standpoint?\nClarke Starnes: Great question we talk a lot about, Gerard. And so I would say as I mentioned, as opposed to multifamily, we view the risk in the CRE sector as more structural, and it still will take some time to play out over the next couple of years. And the way we think about it, everyone with credit in the sector is exposed to the risk. And so the big challenge will be for those that have large concentrations, which we don't. So we feel good about that. And our strategy has been to try to identify the risk early and work through with those borrowers to address all options. And you see that in how we approached risk rating, accrual status and reserves. So that's kind of where we are right now. We feel good about our efforts. But to your point, we still think about the fact there are very few real trades today. So it's hard to know what real price discovery and whether we've hit the bottom of the cycle or not. I think everyone's trying to recognize that and so you've seen that acceleration. What I think is still left to come incrementally, as we are still seeing, as leases fully mature, companies, lessees resizing their space needs. And so you can have performing loans today and a good outlook, but you really don't know until you see the leases mature. The other thing I would say is we are seeing some interest, some early interest on long-term investors coming in and that may help. So I would say still more to come.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have room for one final question and that comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nManan Gosalia: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the NII guide, and I appreciate all the detail on loan growth and deposit betas. Can you talk about how we should think about the impact of securities repricing and the impact of swaps as we think through that 2024 NII?\nMike Maguire: Yes, no problem. On the securities repricing side, not a huge factor. As you know, our speeds, we mature, call it, $2 billion to $3 billion per quarter, and so probably not as big of an impact on -- in terms of upside for '24. But as you think about the swap book, I think, I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we had a little bit of a tailwind to the tune of, call it, $20 million to $25 million relative to Q3. Our outlook for '24, really interesting enough, the first half, it's a tailwind with some of the payers in our portfolio. But we do have some received fixed swaps that will become effective throughout the course of the year, which will later in the, call it, first-half begin to mute the benefit and then by the second half, create a headwind. But for the full year impact, it's actually negligible at least based on the current curve. But that's all factored into our NII outlook.\nManan Gosalia: Got it. And just as we think through the sensitivity to the different rate environment, I think you mentioned some forward starting swaps. Is there any more color, any quantification there? Or anything else we need to think through in terms of the impact on NII from any swings in the forward rate assumptions?\nMike Maguire: Look, I mean, like we disclosed this. I mean if you look at our swap portfolio, we've got about $30 billion of receivers on today. About $10 billion of those will be effective sort of day one this year, and by the end of the year, most will be effective. But again, that's incorporated into our outlook.\nManan Gosalia: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brad Milsaps for closing remarks.\nBrad Milsaps: Okay. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist, and we hope you have a great day. Rocco, you may now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our fourth quarter results, let's begin with our purpose on slide four. As you know, Truist is a purpose-driven company committed to inspiring and building better lives in communities. I'd like to take just a few moments to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose during 2023. Through Truist Community Capital, we committed nearly $2.1 billion to support more than 15,000 units of affordable housing. This helped create more than 15,000 jobs and serve more than 130,000 people in low and modern income communities this year. Also, our teammates impacted 5,300 organizations and causes through their charitable giving and more than 62,000 hours of volunteer service. In addition, we started a small business community heroes initiative, which empowers our branch teammates alongside our virtual small business specialist leveraging our digital solutions to proactively connect via caring conversations with small business owners, who tirelessly work to serve our neighbors, create jobs, build our communities, and help drive our economy. So those are just a few examples of the meaningful work we're doing as a company to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients, our teammates, our communities, and our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. All right, so let's turn to some of the key takeaways on slide six. Truist reported solid fourth quarter results, adjusted earnings after excluding several discrete items that impacted our results. The largest of these items, of course is a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. Mike's going to provide more details later in our call, but this is the result of our annual impairment test, which we conduct each year as of October 1. So importantly, this is -- charge is non-cash, it has no impact on our liquidity, regulatory capital ratios, the payment of our common dividend, or our ability to do business and serve our clients. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income of $1.1 billion or $0.81 a share, which excludes the impact of the impairment charge, the industry-wide FDIC special assessment, and a discrete tax benefit. In addition, pre-tax merger related and restructuring charges of $183 million negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.10 per share. Most of these charges were related to our cost saving plan. Despite these discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we made strong progress on our organization simplification plan during this quarter. Since these initiatives were announced in mid-September, we've reduced headcount, relined significant elements of our organizational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities in 2024 and beyond. As a result of these efforts and others through 2023, the fourth quarter marks the second consecutive quarter we've seen our expenses decline. Although the first quarter will experience typical seasonal expense headwinds, we're on track and fully committed to delivering on the cost initiatives that we outlined in September, which will limit adjusted expense growth to flat to up to 1% in 2024, while also continuing to invest in initiatives for our core clients, technology, and risk management. Although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels, we're encouraged that non-performing loans decline during the quarter, while we continue to build our loan loss reserve considering the uncertain economic environment. Consistent with our capital planning strategy, our CET1 ratio increased 20 basis points sequentially to 10.1. Although we're committed to building capital, our balance sheet also remains open to core clients as our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing clients and the payment of our common dividend. So before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail, let me provide a quick update on our progress we're making on improving the experiences for our clients, we'll do that on slide seven. Truist continues to see improved digital engagement trends with strong transaction growth over the last year. Mobile app users grew 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, which is contributing to increased transaction volumes, which now account for 62% of total bank transactions. As shown in the chart on the left, growth in digital transactions is primarily reflected by increased Zelle usage as clients continue to value efficient payment and money movement capabilities. While this is certainly positive, Truist still has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital, specifically by leveraging our T3 strategy, which is the concept that touch and technology work together to create trust. That further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency. Our goal is to create seamless experiences for our clients by offering more self-service capabilities to enhance the overall client experience. Truist Assist is a perfect example of this concept. Since launching in 2022, we've seen increased client adoption with one-third of the total interactions represented in the fourth quarter of 2023 alone. Additionally, 85% of the conversations were completed using the automated assistant this quarter. As we look into 2024 we expect accelerated adoption of Truist Assist, which should lead to additional operational efficiencies for Truist. Overall, I'm pleased with the digital progress we've made in 2023 and excited about the opportunity to further leverage T3 in 2024 and beyond that. So let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Mike? Thanks, Mike. So looking back at 2023, I'm really proud of the work our teammates accomplished, which helped accelerate our transformation into a simpler, more profitable company. As I discussed in September, our transformation is centered on improving efficiency and realigning certain aspects of our leadership and operating model within our three current operating segments, wholesale, consumer, and insurance, to increase our efficiency and drive revenue opportunities. In the third quarter, we've realigned and consolidated several lines of business within consumer and wholesale, including creating a single enterprise-wide payments group, consolidating three commercial real estate units into one, and consolidating four consumer lending platforms to leverage technology and capital resources. During the fourth quarter, we announced significant leadership appointments within consumer and wholesale, and we formed a new operating council composed of key business leaders from across the organization. These leaders will help improve accountability, efficiency, and ultimately drive better growth across our platform while controlling risk, all of which are primary benefits of the simplification plan. These strategic organizational changes designed to improve long-term revenue growth are complete, and we're beginning to see the impacts from our cost savings initiative. To that end, and as Mike discussed, our cost saving efforts are going well and reflect the planning and execution that was ongoing throughout 2023. These cost saving efforts are funding important investments in our risk management infrastructure and core businesses, while also helping to offset natural expense growth in other parts of our organization. We accomplished all of this while growing net new deposit accounts, strengthening our balance sheet through organic capital growth, and strategically allocating our capital to core businesses. Looking beyond the fourth quarter, our top priorities for 2024 include growing and deepening relationships with our core clients, leveraging our more efficient platform to gain market share, achieving our expense target, and enhancing Truist's digital experience through T3, all while building capital and maintaining strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. We believe there's a significant potential to help our clients achieve their financial success by delivering our commercial consumer payments, investment banking, wealth, and insurance capabilities throughout our existing footprint. In investment banking, we've increased our market share across virtually all of our capital markets products. We've seen a significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products, including investment grade, equity capital markets, leverage finance, and asset securitization. In addition, our mind share with clients and our key industry verticals has never been stronger as we continue to expand in new verticals that are primed for growth as capital market activity recovers. For all of our wholesale businesses, recent changes in client coverage strategies should allow us to focus more intently on opportunities in the middle market where we can bring unique perspective given the breadth and depth of our platform, especially in areas like investment banking and payments. We're seeing solid year-over-year growth in CID referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver value-added advice and capabilities to our clients. Truist Wealth, which beginning in 2024, will be part of our wholesale business segment, has seen positive asset flows in 10 of the last 11 quarters. By bringing the Wealth business over to wholesale, we'll go to market as one team to deliver business transition advisory solutions to commercial and corporate clients. In consumer, I'm encouraged that customer satisfaction scores have returned to pre-merger levels. In addition, net new checking account production was positive in 2023 as we added 59,000 new consumer and 53,000 new business accounts. And during the fourth quarter, we acquired more than 114,000 accounts through our digital channel, including 33,000 new to Truist. While the branch network presents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets, we're seeing improvements in productivity due to excellent teammate execution and investments in technology as evidenced by the increase in net new deposit accounts. We're encouraged by this increased productivity, and we'll look to make investments in branches and select key growth markets in 2025 and beyond. So in conclusion, the fourth quarter was solid, but we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future. We view our fourth quarter performance as another step forward in that direction. We're making strong progress on areas on our control including managing our expenses, building capital, and realigning our business, so that it is well positioned to serve new and existing clients as markets recover. We're firmly committed to achieving our expense target in 2024, while we will continue to build and allocate capital towards core clients in our home markets, which we view as a distinctive competitive advantage. This heightened focus will lead to increased franchise and shareholder value over time. Let me close by just thanking our teammates for their incredible purposeful leadership in 2023. Teammates, your focus and commitment fuels our confidence in 2024 and beyond. Thank you. So with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. Yes, and it's not just part of the pressure on the consumer side is we're creating, you know, as we're really reducing some of our focus on, you know, indirect as an example. And that's somewhat offset by the growth in Sheffield and Service Finance, but that doesn't sort of isn't a perfect balance in there. So the consumer reflects probably a little more of our own action and capital allocation than where we are from a market perspective. And then I think as Mike said, I mean, on the C&I side, you know, we're open for business, you know, so, you know, we're going to serve our markets. And I think we've got really, really strong markets. And when I think recovery comes, it will come disproportionately faster in our markets. And if that happens sooner, we'll see the benefit of that. And we'll be a recipient of that, because we are, I think, gaining share in most of those capabilities. And then the other part I just mentioned is that like and when we're winning, we're winning more disproportionately, so on the C&I side particularly, you know, just you know 15% to 20% more of the deals are in left leads as an example. So, you know, if we look at some of our portfolio last year, we're winning more on the left side. So that's got more profitability and more tailwind in terms of an ability to expand those relationships. So I don't know if we're being conservative, to use that word, but I think we've got to sort of see what's in front of us. And hopefully by the end of the year, you know, if the rates turn out as we all forecast, we'll see a little spur in the economy and I think we'll be direct beneficiaries of that. Yes, Mike, I think an appropriate challenge is always, we've done a lot. So I think I'm really encouraged by the momentum and you can see it really in the third and fourth quarter. And you see that significantly and particularly the expense declines. And we're committed to what we, you know, what we talked about in September. I think our $750 million plan, I'm really proud of our teammates. I'm proud of our leadership. You know, they really got the sleeves rolled up and got after it. So the intensity that's in this company right now about being more efficient, I feel is demonstrably better. And being able to apply that over this more simplified organizational structures where we see the benefits. So if you think about, as I've made in my comments, I mean sort of that process is complete. So now this intensity, these efforts, these initiatives, we apply that over a much more simplified business model. And the decisions that leaders are making, I think are just better, stronger decisions, which lead us to a more efficient company long-term. Yes, so I think we've said pretty clearly that, the insurance business creates a capital opportunity for us and then like outlined that in a lot of specificity. We've said clearly that we're always evaluating alternatives and we're going to do the best thing for the insurance business and the best thing for Truist going forward. And I don't think as it relates to any specific timing and those type of things, I don't think I really should comment beyond that. Great, thanks. Yes, great question. And the good news is we've got a really good balanced investment banking business. So, and, you know, seeing some positive things on, you know, a lot of the different buckets. So if you think about equity capital markets, I mean they're starting to come back. I think we're starting to see some IPO components of that. Our pipeline there is probably the strongest it's been in a long time. And pipeline as active book runner. When and if all that comes to bear, I think that's we'll just have to, that'll be a little bit market dependent. On the debt side, sort of the high yield investment grade, I mean, you've got a lot of maturity sort of running off in \u201824, so there's sort of a natural refinance opportunity. I think, again, sort of that'll be where clients are projecting where they think rates are going to come. So they've got a lot of natural things they have to do and they'll have to pick that point of demarcation where they want to start the refinancing side. And then the M&A pipeline is really strong. We spent a lot of time in energy with our verticals and being really relevant. So the size and scope of some of the things that we're doing are proportionally higher, but we've also built this really great pipeline with our transition advisory business, with our commercial clients. And we've got more in the pipeline there than we closed all of last year, just as an example. So that's sort of that core bread and butter kind of work. And then we have things that were like public finance, which was sort of a nascent business for us 12, 18 months ago, and now starting to build up some momentum and as we see public finance opportunities starting to grow. So we have a lot of cylinders that are working that I think can offset each other and would be a good reason that we would be confident in a pretty nice recovery on the investment banking side. It will be like everything else, a little bit quarter-to-quarter dependent, but hopefully a little less volatility for us given that we've got a lot of cylinders running. Yes, let me answer the first part of that as well. So, you know, I think that's a great question. And, you know, if you look at sort of the barometer, I was trying to say this earlier on sort of where we go, I think we will reflect our economy and our opportunities. So, and we'll just have to see sort of how that gets unleashed going forward. And I think the correlation will probably be more directly seen in the C&I side, because we're -- as I mentioned before, not just a capital preservation, but or optimization, but really more around optimization around return and sort of looking at our core and non-core. So we've pulled the throttle back on some of the consumer side that we consider to be less capital efficient. So that's got a little bit of an overhang in terms of where we look at this. I think if we go into 2024 and trying to answer your question, I think the barometer for us ought to be on the parts of consumer where we're investing and C&I overall. And as I said earlier, I think when we see the recovery, we'll see it more disproportionately in our markets and we should reflect that. So I think that's exactly right. But the net of your whole question, we're not capital constrained in terms of the opportunity for growth in the business, in poor business, in the places where we're investing. And it's just done by segment too, Mike. And then on your second question, hopefully, what I was indicating is that process has started. So if you look at the net new account gains we're seeing, the growth in primacy accounts, the growth in market share and investment banking. So those things are actually underway and happening. I think they'll continue to accelerate, they'll continue to build, they'll continue to manifest, as you said, both on the revenue and both on the efficiency side. I think you actually pointed out, you know, you'll see both sides of that. Yes, I'll give Clarke to comment as well. But yes, there are, you know, part of the great part of our markets is we have a lot of in-migration. So we've had a lot of building in anticipation of that. So if you think about some of our larger markets, Austin, Orlando, I mean, some of the suspects where you've seen a little bit of that. I'll get Clarke to comment on the quality of the portfolio. So that you know the multifamily, large developers that were in and long-term the migration positive continues. So I was looking at some data interesting enough just to make a comment broadly on that. Within our markets last year, we added a metropolitan Charlotte. So just think about that in context. So we added about 2.2 net in-migration into our market. So the overall demographics are good, but I think in fairness to your question, we probably have a little bit of a shorter term watch item versus worry item. Maybe Clarke, you can... Yes, Matt, for right now, we're at 10.1 in building. And so I think until we get more information, until we sort of understand the dynamics a little bit more and think about our company construct, I think the best thing for us right now is to be in an organic capital building mode. So we haven't set a specific target, but I think 10 plus for the short-term, the medium term seems a good place for us to be landing right now. Yeah, I mean, I think, Gerard, if we go back to 2019, that was a different world and a different environment, both in terms of, you know, where we were from a rate standpoint and where we were from a capital standpoint, regulatory standpoint. Now we've got Basel III in front of us. So I think in fairness 20, certainly short and medium term is not necessarily in the windshield. But I think we can continue to perform at a high level in terms of ROTCE. And so all the efficiency opportunities and things we're building, revenue growing, those are things that are continuing to build on that. So I think to think about us being a top performer in that category versus setting a specific target that was constructed in 2019 in a different environment is maybe a different way to think about it."

            "name": "Mike Maguire",
            "content": "Great, thank you Bill and good morning everyone. For the quarter we reported a GAAP net loss of $5.2 billion or $3.85 per share. As Bill noted reported earnings per share were impacted by several items detailed at the top of slide eight. Those include a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.1 billion, a special FDIC assessment of $507 million, and a discrete tax benefit of $204 million. Excluding these three items, adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $0.81 per share. In addition, merger-related and restructuring charges, primarily related to severance and branch consolidation associated with our call-saves initiatives, negatively impacted EPS by another $0.10. Before providing further details on this quarter's underlying financial performance, I do want to provide some additional background on the goodwill impairment charge that occurred during the quarter. We test our goodwill for impairment annually on October 1. This year's test resulted in an impairment of $6.1 billion. The impairment was primarily driven by the continued impact of higher interest rates and higher discount rates and a sustained decline in banking industry share prices, including Truist share price. Importantly, as Bill noted in his opening remarks, this is a non-cash charge and has no impact on our liquidity, no impact on our regulatory capital ratios, our ability to pay our common stock dividend or to serve the needs of our clients. Moving on to the results for the quarter. Total revenue increased 50 basis points sequentially due to a more modest decline in net interest income than expected. Adjusted expenses declined 4.5% or 5.2%, if excluding the impact of TIH Independence Readiness Costs. Our net interest margin improved 3 basis points to 2.98% during the quarter. We added 20 basis points to CET1 capital in the quarter and increased our ALLL ratio by 5 basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty. Finally, our tangible book value per share increased 13% on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to the impact of lower interest rates on the value of our available for sale investment portfolio. Next, we'll turn to page nine to cover loans and leases. Average loans decreased 1.7% sequentially, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts and overall weaker client demand. Average commercial loans decreased 1.8%, primarily due to a 2.3% decrease in CNI balances, primarily due to lower client demand. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased 1.8%, primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage. Overall, we expect average commercial and consumer balances decline modestly in the first quarter driven by our ongoing mix shift toward deeper client relationships, deemphasizing lower return portfolios, and the effects of continued economic uncertainty. Moving now to deposit trends on slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1.4% sequentially as growth in time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in non-interest-bearing and money market balances. Non-interest-bearing deposits decreased 3.7% and represented 29% of total deposits, compared to 30% in the third quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the quarter, consumers continued to seek higher rate alternatives, which drove an increase in deposit costs, albeit at a slower pace relative to recent periods. Typically, total deposit costs increased 9 basis points sequentially to 1.90%, down from a 30 basis point increase in the prior quarter, which resulted in just a 100 basis point increase to our cumulative total deposit beta to 36%. Similarly, interest bearing deposit costs increased 10 basis points, sequentially to 2.67%, down from a 38 basis point increase in the prior quarter, which also resulted in a 100 basis point increase to our cumulative total interest bearing deposit beta to 50%. Going forward, we will continue to maintain a balanced approach, focusing on core relationships, staying attentive to client needs, and striving to maximize the value we can add to relationships outside of rate paid. Moving the net interest income and net interest margin on slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 0.6% linked quarter due to lower average earning assets and higher rate paid on deposits partially offset by favorable hedge income. Reported net interest margin improved 3 basis points on a linked basis quarter. While net interest margin expanded in each of the last two quarters, we expected to contract in the first quarter due to an increase in rate paid on deposits partially offset by continued improvement and spreads on new and renewed loans. Turning the non-interest income on slide 12. Fee income increased $47 million or 2.2% relative to the third quarter. The linked quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher service charges on deposits, which were up $76 million in the fourth quarter, due primarily to the third quarter being impacted by $87 million of client refunds. Lending-related fees increased $51 million linked quarter, due to higher leasing related gains. And other fees declined $66 million due to lower equity income. Fee income was down 3.2% on a like quarter basis as lower investment banking and trading, deposit service charges, mortgage banking and other income were partially offset with higher insurance income and higher lending related fees. Next I'll cover non-interest expense on slide 13, GAAP expenses of $10.3 billion increased 6$.5 billion linked quarter due primarily to the previously mentioned $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge, the $507 million FDIC special assessment, and a $108 million increase in merger-related restructuring expense, partially offset by a $183 million decline in personnel costs. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense declined 4.5% sequentially or 5.2%, excluding the impact of $33 million of TIH independence readiness costs. The decrease in adjusted expense was driven by lower personnel expense due to the execution of our cost savings program, resulting in headcount reductions, as well as lower incentive compensation to reflect our performance in 2023. These improvements were partially offset with higher professional and outside processing expenses. Adjusted non-interest expenses were essentially flat on a light-quarter basis. As Bill mentioned, we are pleased with the progress that we've made on the cost savings initiative that we announced in September. Our original goal was to eliminate or avoid expenses of approximately $750 million over a 12 to 18 month period, which would help us manage our expense growth in 2024 to flat to up 1%. The largest category of savings targeted in our plan was a reduction in force driven by a company-wide assessment of spans and layers of management, the elimination of redundant functions, and the restructuring of certain business lines. We've made significant progress here. FTEs are down 4% from June 30 to December 31 with the final set of reductions underway in the first quarter. The second category we highlighted included cost savings opportunities that would be driven by organizational simplification. Examples include reimagining our go-to-market strategy and CRE, simplifying our benefits programs, and right sizing our branch network and related staffing. As part of these efforts, we anticipate reducing the size of our branch footprint by nearly 4% during the first-half of 2024. In addition to lowering headcount and simplifying our organization, we also reexamined our technology investment spend. Through this process, we have rationalized, rescoped, or delayed the start of a number of projects primarily in non-core areas. We estimated restructuring costs related to this initiative to be approximately $225 million or 30% of our initial $750 million goal. So far, we have incurred around $200 million of charges related to the program, mostly driven by reductions in force in the facilities-related decisions. We would expect to recognize the bulk of the remaining costs in the first quarter. It's clear to state here that the work is never done and we continue to assertively manage costs. But we feel confident that we will achieve our flat to up 1% expense target for 2024. Okay, moving on to asset quality on slide 14. Asset quality metrics continue to normalize in the fourth quarter, but overall remain manageable. Non-performing loans declined 6% linked quarter, while early stage delinquencies increased 11 basis points sequentially due to an increase in 30 to 89 day past due consumer and C&I loans. Included in our appendix is an updated data on our office portfolio represents 1.7% of total loans. We are pleased that non-performing and criticizing classified office loans decreased modestly linked quarter, while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from 8.3% at September 30 to 8.5% at year end. During the quarter our net charge off ratio increased 6 basis points to 57 basis points. The increase in net charge offs for the quarter reflects increases on our other consumer, indirect auto and C&I lending portfolios partially offset by lower CRE losses. We continued to build reserves as provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by $119 million. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.54%, up 5 basis points sequentially, and 20 basis points year-over-year, due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we've tightened our risk appetite in select areas, though we remain -- maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality long-term clients. Turning now to capital on slide 15. Truist added 20 basis points of CET1 capital in the fourth quarter through a combination of organic capital generation, disciplined RWA management, and this quarter's tax benefit, partially offset by the FDIC special assessment. With a CET1 ratio of 10.1%, Truist remains well-capitalized relative to our minimum regulatory requirement of 7.4% that became effective on October 1. We remain committed to building capital and do not have plans to repurchase shares over the near-term. We continue to be disciplined with our RWA management strategy as we allocate less capital to certain businesses, though we have been clear that our balance sheet remains open to core clients. Our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing core clients, as well as the payment of our $0.52 per share quarterly dividend. In addition, we continue to believe that Truist's capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings is a distinctive advantage. We estimate that our residual 80% ownership stake provides greater than 200 basis points of additional capital flexibility and we continue to evaluate our strategic options with respect to TIH. The table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our AOCI at year-end. During the fourth quarter, the component of AOCI attributable to securities declined from $13.5 billion to $11.1 billion or by $2.4 billion due to the decline in long-term interest rates during the quarter and finished 2023 essentially flat when compared to year-end 2022. AOCI related to our pension plan improved from $1.5 billion to $1.1 billion, which is a level that will remain static throughout 2024. Based on estimated cash flows in today's forward curve, we would expect the component of AOCI attributable to securities to decline from $11.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter to $8 billion by the end of 2026 or by approximately 28%. We continue to feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements and build capital under the proposed phase and periods based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules. We have refined our estimate for the impact to risk-weighted assets under Basel III and now expect a mid-single-digit increase in risk-weighted assets, compared to our previous estimate of a high-single-digit increase. Finally, as it relates to the proposed rules for a long-term debt requirement, we estimate the Truist binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately $12 billion. We remain confident that we will be able to meet the proposed requirement at both the bank and the holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phase-in period. As part of our regular way funding plan, we issued $1.75 billion of long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2023. All right, I'll now turn to page 16 to review our updated guidance. Looking into the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenues to remain flat or decline by 1% from 4Q 2023 GAAP revenue of $5.8 billion. Net interest income is likely to be down 3% to 4% in the first quarter, which is more than we experienced in the fourth quarter due primarily to one less day, a smaller balance sheet, and some pressure on our net interest margin driven by rate paid. We expect linked quarter improvement in non-interest income due to higher insurance and investment banking and trading income partially offset by lower other and lending related fee income. Adjusted expenses of $3.4 billion are expected to increase by 4%, due to normal seasonal increases related to payroll taxes and higher incentive accruals. For the full-year 2024, we expect revenues to decrease by 1% to 3%. Our balance sheet and interest rate sensitivity continue to be positioned as relatively neutral, which is in line with our long-term goal. Our forecast assumes that net interest income troughs in the first-half of 2024, and then remains relatively stable, assuming five reductions in the Fed funds rate with the first reduction coming in May 2024. In addition, we assume that insurance continues to grow at high-single-digit rate, while investment banking and trading should benefit from a recovery in capital markets. Although we anticipate adjusted expenses rising 4% in the first quarter due to seasonal factors, full-year 2024 adjusted expenses are still expected to remain flat or to increase 1% over 2023 adjusted expenses of $14 billion, which includes TIH Independence Readiness Costs. Our 2024 expense guidance of flat to up 1% also includes $85 million of TIH independence readiness costs. In terms of asset quality, we expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points, reflecting a continued normalization of loss rates across our consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, a lower denominator from declining loan balances, and our strategy to be proactive in resolving higher-risk portfolios. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis. I'll now turn it back to Bill for some final remarks. Yes. Good morning, John. No problem, so I guess if you think about \u201824 NII, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we've got five cuts in our base plan, the first in May, and then really another 25 at each meeting with the exception of November. On balances, you know, we mentioned I think, you know, loans probably a touch of pressure in the first quarter, maybe down less than 1%. And then relatively stable on the C&I side, we see a nice, a more stable outlook for the year on the consumer side, a bit of pressure. Deposits, sort of, picking up where we left off in the fourth quarter, so down call it a 1.5% or so in the first, and then declining, but I think albeit it may be a declining rate over the year. So that's, I think, the primary piece. You know, John, we think about repricing. And I think you've heard from peers as well on this. I mean, probably a bit of caution warranted around the betas. So we think that some of the faster stuff that moved on the way up probably moves fast on the way down, but there's still going to be a considerable amount of repriced lag. And so I guess those are the fundamentals. And then I guess you asked about cuts and whether there were fewer. I think we mentioned we're relatively neutral versus our base case on the five cuts. So whether there are three or four, maybe six or seven cuts, I think we have less sensitivity there. That being said, I think it's an area where there are no cuts, you know, that would be, or significantly delayed cuts, that would be a headwind for us. Yes, and you're right on the amortization that would be excluded. On the Mercs, you know, we mentioned, you know, we've got 25 left on our cost savings initiatives based on estimates in the first quarter. You know, they'll be down versus last year. You know, so, you know, should not be as much noise in \u201824 as we saw in \u201823. You know, maybe just to touch, John, but I don't expect that to be a significant factor in our \u201824. Yes, Scott, I think you're right. I think in our base case, we're assuming a couple of things. The five cuts we think will benefit demand a touch, but to the extent that that's underestimated, that would be welcome news. And I think we mentioned from a C&I perspective, we do expect modest growth in that portfolio, at least in the second quarter, third quarter, and beyond. I think most of the pressure that we're seeing for the year is still on the consumer side. Others may weigh in on other factors, Bill? Yes, Scott, I can give that to you. So, you know, on a stated basis, you know, we finished the quarter at 10.1%. You know, if you look at our -- the new balance from an OCI perspective, and this would include the AFS security, as well as the pension, that's about a 2.9% impact. So that would take you down to, you know, call it, I guess 7.2%. And then, you know, the other factors like the thresholds and the RWA inflation we mentioned, you know, earlier in the call that we have done more work around an estimate for what the RWA impact might be under Basel and also a little more work on the thresholds, call those another percent. So that walks you down to low-6s. Yes. Yes, Erika, you know, I'm not -- it's a great question, and one we're spending a lot of time on. Look, I mean, I think initially out of the gates, and if these come, call it, you know, \u201825, you know, at a time and you think about the first 100s so the first four for us, I think the first-half of that, it's going to be really pressured by guys still repricing up across the retail business and certain products and segments. So I guess my use of the word cautionary is thinking about kind of where we're ending up right now on a cumulative beta perspective and just acknowledging that we're going to be lower than that out of the gates for certain. But I don't think, if you think about our NII outlook, I think you've got a pretty good sense for how we're thinking about the reprice trend. And we mentioned we think in the first quarter in sort of a static rate environment, we're going to be down 3% to 4% on balances and day count and a touch worse on rate paid. And you know, from there, as we start to see the cuts, in our case, we think we flatten out and are pretty stable. Yeah, I'll go on the first one. Ebrahim, thanks for the question. You know, you sort of said, hey, I assume it's sort of not just math, or maybe you said it is mathematical, and that's right. I mean, at the end of the day, we do an annual test for impairment. There are I mean thousands and thousands of factors that go into this work. There are customary evaluation approaches. You know, you evaluate each reporting unit. You know, if you think about it the factors that are significant that we cited in our prepared remarks is that you do have a very you know you've had degradation in operating conditions for the industry you had a significant decline in broadly speaking bank stock valuations, Truist market valuation at the time and we do this test as of a certain day each year. In our case, it's October 1. So all those factors are considered and influence the outcome. But at the end of the day, the estimated fair value is below the carrying value, and that's the output. But again, just to reiterate this, absolutely zero impact to our financial condition or how we think about our opportunity or our strategy or what we're doing. Yes, that's right. You look at the various reporting segments, the reporting units for us, which are the consumer and wealth business, at least in \u201823, corporate and commercial, and then insurance. Yes, no, Matt, I think we're just, you know, in the moment we're in, you know, we're looking at spot capital, we're thinking about transitioned, you know, capital measurements if we phase into new rules and we're looking at fully phased in. I think the whole industry is thinking about it that way. So I think when Bill thinks about 10, I mean I think about it on a transitional basis, staying at or above 10 is probably what Bill is implying. But I think shorter term is like we're building capital, we're going to continue to do that through organic earnings and hopefully we'll have a little more visibility on this rule and can give you a little better sense for kind of a medium term target. Yes, no problem. On the securities repricing side, not a huge factor. As you know, our speeds, we mature, call it, $2 billion to $3 billion per quarter, and so probably not as big of an impact on -- in terms of upside for '24. But as you think about the swap book, I think, I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we had a little bit of a tailwind to the tune of, call it, $20 million to $25 million relative to Q3. Our outlook for '24, really interesting enough, the first half, it's a tailwind with some of the payers in our portfolio. But we do have some received fixed swaps that will become effective throughout the course of the year, which will later in the, call it, first-half begin to mute the benefit and then by the second half, create a headwind. But for the full year impact, it's actually negligible at least based on the current curve. But that's all factored into our NII outlook. Look, I mean, like we disclosed this. I mean if you look at our swap portfolio, we've got about $30 billion of receivers on today. About $10 billion of those will be effective sort of day one this year, and by the end of the year, most will be effective. But again, that's incorporated into our outlook."

            "name": "Clarke Starnes",
            "content": "And this is Clarke. Thanks for the question, our \u201824 NCO guidance, as Mike said, it assumes we're going to continue to see normalization occur, both in consumer and wholesale. We've already seen a lot of it in the consumer side. We have a higher mix, as Bill said, of higher margin consumer finance businesses and less relative mortgage and prime auto, that's a factor on the loss assumption. But I think the biggest one that you've pointed out, we're working really hard to get ahead of any potential areas of stress, think CRE office and so our guidance also reflects opportunities to be opportunistic to work through if we see more challenges in that space as that structural risk unfolds. So we hope to do better, but we're assuming we're going to work hard to make sure of that we get ahead of any risk. I agree with you, Bill. Overall, we still think multifamily long-term is a very favorite asset class and some of the current challenges from our perspective relate more to a margin or current debt service coverage risk issue, given rate increases, higher operating cost, and to your point the new pipeline supply that's coming on. And we just view that very differently than the structural risk we see in office as an example. So we're working with our borrowers to address their specific situations as we look out and how they're going to address this impact. Again, so what we would expect more temporary increase in watch lists, some non-accruals, but nowhere near the same loss risk exposure you see in office. And I would remind you that there's very active secondary placement sources, a lot of equity sources willing to come in. And the clients that we have, to Bills point, they want these assets and they're supporting those. So we think it's a manageable risk, even though there's some short-term pressure. Great question we talk a lot about, Gerard. And so I would say as I mentioned, as opposed to multifamily, we view the risk in the CRE sector as more structural, and it still will take some time to play out over the next couple of years. And the way we think about it, everyone with credit in the sector is exposed to the risk. And so the big challenge will be for those that have large concentrations, which we don't. So we feel good about that. And our strategy has been to try to identify the risk early and work through with those borrowers to address all options. And you see that in how we approached risk rating, accrual status and reserves. So that's kind of where we are right now. We feel good about our efforts. But to your point, we still think about the fact there are very few real trades today. So it's hard to know what real price discovery and whether we've hit the bottom of the cycle or not. I think everyone's trying to recognize that and so you've seen that acceleration. What I think is still left to come incrementally, as we are still seeing, as leases fully mature, companies, lessees resizing their space needs. And so you can have performing loans today and a good outlook, but you really don't know until you see the leases mature. The other thing I would say is we are seeing some interest, some early interest on long-term investors coming in and that may help. So I would say still more to come."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist third quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings' Chairman and CEO, are also in attendance and available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Now, before we get into the third quarter results, let's begin as always with our purpose on Slide 4. As we all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. I'd like to take a few minutes just to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose last quarter. Truist is driving positive change by supporting organizations that promote the growth and vibrancy of our communities. In August, we invested $17 million to support affordable housing in Charlotte and career development and economic mobility programs across the state of North Carolina. And just last week, we announced our allocation of $65 million in new market tax credits from the U.S. Treasury's Community Development Financial Institution Fund. This is the 12th time Truist has received an award, which has allowed us to invest $750 million in underserved communities by providing loans with reduced rates of interest and/or non-traditional terms. Over the years, these loans have helped spark economic development and job growth and communities across the regions we serve. I'm really proud of the meaningful work we're doing as a company to have a positive effect on the lives of our clients, our teammates and our communities and, of course, our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. Now, let's turn to some of the key takeaways on Slide 6. Truist reported solid third quarter earnings that met our guidance despite certain discrete non-interest income and expense items that negatively impacted our results. Mike is going to cover those later in the call. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several underlying key themes. On our July earnings call, we discussed our intent to significantly reduce the rate of expense growth at our company, which was followed up with the introduction of our simplification efforts and $750 million cost saves program in September. We're fully committed to delivering on this work. And the reduction in third quarter expenses is evidence of the hard work that's been ongoing throughout the year. We're also managing our balance sheet more efficiently. During the past few earnings calls, I've described how we're focusing on core clients, reducing lower-yielding portfolios and paying down higher cost borrowings, all of which occurred during the third quarter and helped drive our NIM higher by four basis points during the quarter. Moreover, these efforts have increased our CET1 ratio to nearly 10%, which is a level that we believe we can maintain throughout the proposed phase-in period under pending Basel III rules based on our current rate of organic capital growth. Although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels, we are encouraged that our metrics remained relatively stable during the quarter, while we continue to build our loan loss reserve, considering the uncertain economic environment. Lastly, we're making strong progress on our cost saves program and organizational simplification, which we'll discuss in more detail later the call. I'm pleased with our direction, the intensity, and focus and I'm confident in our ability to emerge as a stronger company. While the quarter was solid, we acknowledge there's more work to do as strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future. We view this third quarter performance as a step forward in that direction. So, let's do some more specific work on Slide 7. Net income available to common shareholders was $1.1 billion or $0.80 per share. Merger-related and restructuring charges primarily related to severance associated with our cost saves program hurt EPS by $0.04. Total revenue decreased as expected and was essentially in line with our guidance despite an $87 million discrete impact to service charges on deposits revenue. We're also encouraged that our net interest margin improved four basis points, driven by our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts, including a reduction in FHLB borrowings, a decline in lower-yielding loan balances, and improving new and renewed loan spreads. Adjusted expenses were down 50 basis points and within our guidance range and would have decreased 250 basis points excluding $70 million of higher-than-normal other expense. Average loans decreased 2.5%, primarily due to the sale of the student loan portfolio in the second quarter and our continued repositioning towards higher-return core assets. Average deposits increased modestly as we continue to experience a remixing towards higher-yielding alternatives. We added 29 basis points of CET1 capital in the quarter and increased our ALLL ratio by six basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty. Lastly, we maintained our strong quarterly common stock dividend at $0.52 per share paid on September 1st. So, let's move to our digital update on Slide 8. Digital engagement trends at Truist remain positive, as you can see on the left side of the slide. Mobile app users have grown steadily over the past year, and we're currently focused on driving additional growth through our MobileFirst engagement initiative. From an activity standpoint, digital transactions increased 9% relative to the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by Zelle transactions, which were up 32% over the same period. Due to the rapid growth we've experienced, Digital has quickly become a preferred channel for interacting with Truist. In fact, digital transactions now account for more than 60% of total bank transactions. And while that's certainly positive, Truist has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital, specifically by leveraging what we call T3, which is this concept that touch and technology work together to create trust, and that further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency. As a proof point, recent enhancements to the digital onboarding have helped drive a 19% increase in Truist One funding rates year-to-date, which may in turn lead to additional balances and transaction activity with those new clients. In sum, Truist has solid momentum in digital and I'm highly optimistic about the potential we have to leverage T3 to further expand our digital user base and drive transaction volume. Next, I'm going to cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans decreased 2.5% sequentially, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts, including the sale of our student loan portfolio last quarter and further reductions in lower return portfolios. Excluding the student loan sale, average loans were down 1.1%. Average commercial loans decreased 1.1% primarily due to a 1.5% decrease in C&I balances driven by lower revolver utilization and production. Lower C&I production in our corporate and commercial banking segment reflected a combination of moderately lower demand due to economic uncertainty and greater pricing discipline which contributed to wider spreads on new production and commercial community bank. In our consumer and credit card portfolios, average loans decreased 4.6%, primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and further reductions in indirect auto production. Consumer and card balances were down 1%, excluding the student loan sale. Residential mortgage was essentially flat relative to the prior quarter. We do continue to experience growth in higher yielding portfolios, especially Sheffield in Service Finance. Loan production increased 21% year-over-year at Sheffield and 17% at Service Finance. Overall, we expect average commercial and consumer balances to decline modestly in the fourth quarter, driven by our ongoing mixed shift towards deeper client penetrations, deeper relationships, the emphasis of lower return portfolios and the effects of continued economic uncertainty. Let's move to the deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits were flat sequentially, although we continued to experience remixing within the portfolio, as clients saw higher rate alternatives. Noninterest bearing deposits decreased 3.9% and currently represent 30% of total deposits compared to 31% in the second quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of last year. Within our segments, average deposits were down 1% in corporate and commercial banking and relatively flat in consumer banking and wealth due to the effects of quantitative tightening and availability of higher rate alternatives. We continue to deepen our relationships with Consumer Banking and Wealth Clients, especially in payments. Net new checking account production has been positive for three quarters in a row. We're also seeing solid adoption of our flagship Truist One checking product. In addition, small business deposits were up sequentially, and August was the strongest month for net new small business checking account production in the last three years. Deposit costs continue to rise during the third quarter, though at a slower pace. Interest-bearing deposit cost increased 38 basis points sequentially, down from a 55 basis point increase in the prior quarter. Our interest-bearing cumulative deposit beta was 49%, up from 44% in the second quarter due to the presence of higher rate alternatives and ongoing mixed shift from noninterest-bearing accounts into higher yielding products. Going forward, we'll continue to maintain our balanced approach, being attentive to our client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value for them outside of rate paid. Now, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results in a little more detail. Mike?\nMike Maguire: Great. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin with net interest income on Slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent, net interest income decreased 1.6% linked quarter primarily due to lower average earning assets and higher deposit costs. Although net interest income was down linked quarter, we are encouraged that the decline was slower than the 6.1% decrease observed in the second quarter as deposit betas increased at a more moderate pace. Reported net interest margin increased 4 basis points after declining for two consecutive quarters. NIM stabilization reflected our ongoing balance sheet optimization initiatives, including: focusing on our core clients, improving spreads on new and renewed loans, reducing lower-yielding loan portfolios and paying down higher cost wholesale borrowings, including FHLB advances, which were down about $20 billion on average compared to the second quarter. Turning to non-interest income on Slide 12. Fee income decreased $185 million or 8.1% relative to the second quarter. The decline was primarily attributable to lower insurance income, which decreased $142 million sequentially due to seasonality. Insurance production is typically lowest in the third quarter and highest in the second. Insurance fundamentals remain strong, driven by new business growth, improved retention and favorable pricing, all of which contributed to 6.3% organic revenue growth on a like-quarter basis. Service charges on deposits were down $88 million in the third quarter due primarily to $87 million of client refund accruals that were driven by changes we made to our deposit fee protocols. Investment banking and trading income was lower by $26 million, while other income increased $38 million primarily due to higher income from other investments. Fee income was flat on a like-quarter basis as higher insurance income and higher other income were offset by lower service charges and lower investment banking and trading income. Next, I'll cover non-interest expense on Slide 13. Reported non-interest expense was flat sequentially as lower adjusted expense was offset by a $21 million increase in merger-related and restructuring expense, driven mostly by severance and facilities rationalization. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our July guidance range of flat to down 1%. The decrease in adjusted expenses was driven by lower personnel expense and reduced professional fees and outside processing expense, partially offset by higher other expense. The increase in other expense included $70 million of costs arising from the previously mentioned client deposit service charge refund accruals as well the settlement of certain litigation matters, including a settlement and patent licensing agreement, which resolved the USAA patent infringement lawsuit. If you excluded these items, adjusted expenses declined by 2.5% linked quarter. The work associated with our gross cost saves program is well underway as we will discuss on Slide 14. In September, we announced a $750 million gross cost saves plan that will be achieved over the next 12 to 18 months. The cost saves will include $300 million from reductions in force, $250 million from organizational realignment and simplification and $200 million from technology expense reductions. Since these initiatives were announced in mid-September, we have already realigned significant elements of our organizational and operational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities. The work we're doing includes optimizing spans and layers to improve organizational design health, consolidating redundant functions, restructuring select businesses and geographic simplification, all of which will result in reductions force over the next couple of quarters. In addition, we are aggressively managing third-party spend, reducing our corporate real estate footprint and rationalizing technology spend. Based on the latest information available, we still expect one-time costs associated with the cost saves program to range from 25% to 30% of gross cost saves. We also continue to project the cost saves program will help us manage adjusted expense growth to 0% to 1% in 2024, which is net of natural expense growth driven by inflation and other factors. Moving to asset quality on Slide 15. Asset quality metrics continued to normalize in the third quarter, but overall remain manageable. Non-performing assets were unchanged linked-quarter, while early-stage delinquencies increased four basis points sequentially as increases in our consumer portfolios were partially offset by declines in commercial. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which represents 1.7% of total loans. We're pleased that non-performing and criticized and classified office loans increased only modestly linked-quarter, while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from 6.2% at June 30, up to 8.3% at September 30. Our net charge-off ratio decreased 3 basis points to 51 basis points, reflecting the prior quarter impact of the student loan sale, partially offset by increases in our CRE and consumer lending portfolios. [Total] reserves as provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by $92 million. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.49%, up 6 basis points sequentially and 15 basis points year-over-year due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we have tightened our risk appetite in select areas, though we maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality, long-term clients. Turning to capital now on Slide 16. Based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules, we feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements under the proposed phase-in periods. Truist added 29 basis points of CET1 capital in the third quarter through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined RWA management. With a CET1 ratio of 9.9%, Truist remains well capitalized relative to our new minimum regulatory requirement of 7.4%, which took place on October 1. As a company, we are strongly committed to building capital and achieving a CET1 ratio of approximately 10% by the end the year. The projected trajectory for our CET1 ratio does incorporate headwinds from the pending FDIC assessment, which is now expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter. Our primary capital priorities are supporting the organic growth needs of new and existing core clients and the payment of our $0.52 per share common dividend. We have no plans to repurchase shares over the near-term and we will continue to allow previous acquisitions to mature. RWA management continues to be disciplined as we allocate less capital to certain businesses, though we have been very clear that our balance sheet is open to core clients. In addition, we continue to believe that Truist's capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings is a distinctive advantage. We estimate that our residual 80% ownership stake provides greater than 200 basis points of additional capital flexibility. The table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our AOCI. Based on estimated cash flows in today's forward curve, we would expect the component of AOCI attributable to securities decline from $13.5 billion at the end of the third quarter to $9.7 billion by the end of 2026 or a decline of 28%. Finally, as it relates to the proposed rules for a long-term debt requirement, we estimate that Truist's binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately $13 billion. We are confident that we will meet the proposed requirements at both the bank and holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phase-in period. Now, I will review our updated guidance on Slide 17. Looking into the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be flat or to decline 1% from 3Q 2023 GAAP revenue of $5.7 billion. We expect linked-quarter improvement in non-interest income due to higher insurance, service charges on deposit income, and investment banking and trading income, partially offset by lower mortgage and other income. Net interest income is likely to remain under some pressure due to our smaller balance sheet and modest NIM compression. Adjusted expenses of $3.5 billion are expected to decline 3.5% due to lower personnel and other expenses. In April, we stated that our 2023 expense guidance excluded expenses associated with TIH independence readiness. Previously, we've not called out these costs because they totaled only $20 million through the first nine months of 2023, including $9 million in the second quarter and $11 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect these expenses to approximate $35 million, which are excluded from our 4Q 2023 expense guidance. For the full year 2023, we expect revenues to increase by approximately 1.5%, which is at the midpoint of our previous revenue guidance of up 1% to 2%. Our guidance includes the $87 million client refund accrual that negatively impacted fees in the third quarter. Full year 2023 adjusted expenses are still on track to increase 7%. This includes $70 million related to the legal settlements and client deposit service charge refunds, but excludes the $55 million of TIH Independence readiness costs for 2023. In terms of asset quality, we have tightened our guidance from a range of 40 to 50 basis points to approximately 50 basis points for the full year, which includes the impact of the student loan sale. Finally, we expect our tax rate tax rate - effective to approximate 18% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis compared to 19% and 21% previously. Now, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\nBill Rogers: Great. Thanks Mike. And I'll conclude on Slide 18. So looking beyond the third quarter, our transformation into a simpler, more profitable company is underway. We're driving swift and meaningful actions to simplify our organization, which include key organizational changes. So, for example, in the recent weeks we've streamlined our commercial and community banking regions from 21 to 14, realigned several overlapping units into a unified commercial real estate business. We merged our consumer payments and wholesale payments businesses into a single Enterprise Payments organization, which will help us to accelerate payments activity more effectively across Truist. There have been a number of team consolidations within our consumer and small business banking lines of businesses. We've also realigned nine teams under our enterprise operational services to drive efficiencies across our support team serving the whole organization. All of these changes are part of our $750 million cost saves program, which is well underway and designed to drive better service for our clients and limit adjusted expense growth to flat up 1% in 2024. Although we're focused on reducing the rate of expense growth, we will continue to invest in our risk management organization and ability to maintain strong asset quality metrics. While there are many changes happening inside Truist, we've not lost focus on our core consumer and commercial businesses, which is an area that will continue to see significant investment. Net new checking account production has been positive for the first three quarters of this year, and we're on track to continue positive net news for the whole year. During the quarter, we acquired more than 39,000 households through our digital channel. We're also maintaining momentum in wealth, where net organic asset flows have been positive in nine of the past 10 quarters. Client satisfaction scores were stable or increased across most RSPB channels during the third quarter. In the corporate and commercial, new left lead transactions were up 45% year-over-year. Lastly, our wholesale payments pipeline is up 10% year-over-year. We're also seeing strong improvement in client sentiment amongst commercial clients, reflecting product and digital investments that we've already made. As a company, we're also operating our balance sheet more efficiently, thanks to our focus on core clients, deemphasizing lower-return portfolios and paying down higher cost debt. We're building capital, and we feel confident in our ability to satisfy the requirements proposed in the Basel III Endgame rules with the proposed phase-in periods, while preserving our strategic flexibility with TIH. In conclusion, we're making progress and we're doing what's necessary to improve our financial performance to meet your high expectations and, of course, ours. I am truly optimistic about Truist, and I know we're well-positioned for the future. Our teammates are really performing at a high level, and they are committed to serving our clients, caring for each other and capitalizing on our great growth markets, I am really proud of our teammates. Before we move to Q&A, I also want to publicly thank the eight members of our Board of Directors who plan to retire at the end of this year. I'm deeply grateful for their years of service and meaningful contributions to our company. Truist literally exists due to their leadership and confidence. Following these retirements, our Board will consist of 13 members, including 12 Independent Directors who are well-positioned to oversee and advance our strategic plans during this period of rapid industry transformation. So with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you, and we look forward to the Q&A.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Bill. Anthony, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session As you do that, I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible in the call today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may now go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for the color and update. I just \u2013 Bill, just coming back to the independence preparation for TIH and articles that were in the paper, I know you're still, I'm talking about the optionality. Can you just give us an updated sense of just how you're looking at the value of the business financially versus strategically? And what would change here to make you guys move forward with some type of transaction to move it forward?\nBill Rogers: Yes, Ken, good morning and thanks for that. As you can imagine, I don't want to comment on any rumor or speculation. But to your question, think about the reason we did the opportunity with standpoint. I mean what we wanted to do is exactly what you highlighted in your question is to create this financial and strategic flexibility for both Truist for TIH. We wanted to establish value in the business, and the business is growing. I mean, we've been able to hire and retain talent. So we feel really good about what's happening in the core insurance business. We wanted to make sure that the insurance business had flexibility to continue to grow and then that Truist has an opportunity to respond so whatever may happen. I mean, we're obviously in a market that's got lot of uncertainty to it, and we just want to retain that strategic and financial flexibility. So there's not one thing. There's not like a queue. If something happens, we do this, But we want to just continue to reserve this flexibility and continue to apply it to both the bank and the insurance business.\nKen Usdin: Yes. And I guess just a follow-up on it as well. Like at what point does financial benefit become strategic? Because a lot of the questions we get are the trade-off between the two. An obvious ability to improve capital versus a delta in terms of like fee contribution, ROE, et cetera. So it's hard for the investor community to kind of just understand what that incremental switch is. I guess, maybe, how do you think about that notion of like when financial becomes strategic?\nBill Rogers: Yes. As I said, there isn't a particular trigger point. We just want to make sure that we retain that flexibility and we're constantly looking at everything that you just talked about and factoring that into the decision-making. This is something that we sort of continually keep in front of ourselves, we keep in front of the Board. But I think the intentionality - I mean, reason we did this is we're allowed to have this conversation around flexibility.\nKen Usdin: Right. Okay. Thank you, Bill.\nBill Rogers: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may now go ahead.\nJohn McDonald: Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask you about net interest income. A number of banks have said that they see NII dollars potentially bottoming in the fourth quarter. Mike mentioned you see a little bit of slippage into the fourth quarter. But do you have any visibility on whether that could stabilize fourth quarter? And what factors should we think about for you as we think about the NII path heading into next year?\nMike Maguire: Yes, good morning, John. We obviously did see some pressure this quarter, actually probably a little bit better than we expected and that we talked about during the second quarter. We do expect to continue to see some pressure in the fourth, and frankly, even into the first half of 2024. And I think that just has to do with the rate path. We have an expectation that we think we've seen our last hike, and we don't have a cut in forecast until July of next year. We have two cuts in the second half. And so as betas - sort of, again, the good news is, are slowing down, and we feel like grinding a bit lower, we should still feel a little bit of pressure there. We're trying to combat some of that pressure. We've been very intentional around how we're managing rate paid across our client base. We're beginning to see some nice progress as it relates to new and renewed credit spreads. We're repricing some of the fixed rate loans. So the good news is, is while there's pressure, it's moderating, but we still do see that pressure into early next year.\nJohn McDonald: Got you. Thank, Mike. And in terms of the expenses, when you talk about the goal for next year to be flat to up 1%, can you remind us how much of the $750 million gross are you expecting it next year and whether you might also have TIH readiness costs go into next year, too.\nMike Maguire: Yes. I can start there, John. I think Bill may want to weigh in, too. Hard to say. I mean, we said on the 750. It's kind of 12 to 18 months. I mean, I think if you think about two-thirds plus or minus being recognized next year, maybe it's a little more than that. That's how we're thinking about the math there. And that would again, John, give us the confidence that we have to make sure we manage expense growth to less than 1%. You asked about TIH readiness costs as well. We're not ready to talk about 2024 yet there. We will give you more visibility to that when we guide for the full year in January.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you. Good morning.\nMike Maguire: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess maybe Mike, just following up on the expense savings, one, just like to think through when we look at the 0% to 1% growth next year, when do these get realized and should we assume that the expense run rate through 2024 continues to decline? So when we are thinking about exit 2024, second half 2024, expenses will be lower than first half 2024, is that just from a construct standpoint the right way to think about how these flows through relative to your offsetting investments?\nMike Maguire: Yes. Ebrahim, I think the way I'd answer that question is, a lot of the action we're taking, actually right now and in the rest of the fourth quarter and early next year around, for example, some of the organizational design and health and some of the reductions in force, you'll see that come into the run rate relatively quickly. Same goes for some of the realignment of businesses. Those have different flavors. In certain cases, if we significantly restructure a business, like as a good example, we discontinued our middle market agency trading business earlier this year. That was a pretty quick adjustment to run rate. Other adjustments we're making maybe take place throughout the course of next year. And then technology spend, which as you recall is a pretty significant component of our cost savings plan. That has a variety of flavors as well. So I'd say for the most part, you're going to see pretty good progress on run rate adjustment sort of as we exit 2023 and enter 2024. And you'll see, I think, just sort of continuous improvement throughout the course of the year.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. Thanks, Mike. And I guess this is a separate question. So, you talked about exiting certain businesses, a student loan portfolio, another one. How much more is there as you think about just making the balance sheet more efficient, optimizing capital? Is there a lot more to go on the asset side that you could look to exit or sale? And if there's any way to quantify that?\nMike Maguire: I think we got after the lowest hanging fruit pretty quickly. Ebrahim, the student portfolio was not a strategic asset for us. It was less profitable. There have been other businesses within even our C&I business, for example, that we didn't feel like we're as highly as strategic. We've talked a lot about correspondent mortgage and some of our national indirect lending businesses. So, I think that we have a pretty good line of sight to it. I think going forward, it's just much more around optimization, right? And being more disciplined in how we select opportunities, how we price opportunities. We're seeing that come through in our results as well. But there's not, I don't think a significant shoe to drop on portfolio sales and those types of things.\nBill Rogers: Maybe the only thing to add to that, Mike, is just particularly in the areas that we've seen really good growth like Sheffield and Service Finance, we'll do more securitization. So, we'll create more velocity around those things on our balance sheet, which I think are great. So, continue the production, continue to acquire new clients but increase velocity. And we'll look at that with other parts of our portfolio. So, I think Mike said it right, I mean it's not a major power shift. But this optimization strategy, our team has really embraced, and I think we just continue to have more opportunities, I'm going to say, around the edges but maybe more significant that as we move forward. And you saw that reflected in the NIM this quarter.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may now go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: This first question is for you, Bill. I think just taking a step back and thinking about Slide 16, I think a handful of your investors did think that once you struck the deal with Stone Point, that it was a sort of one-way exit. That being said, that deal was struck in February, right? The world didn't change in until March. And so my question for you is that you have this monetization opportunity for Truist Insurance Holdings. And as you think about the proceeds, again, clearly, the world has changed. So, how do you balance essentially the push that some investors are calling for in terms of restructuring your portfolio very meaningfully? And I can see in that in that middle chart Slide 16 that portfolio is a very, very slow lead versus if you do that, you're essentially making the same call you did in 4Q 2020, which is assume that rates are going to stay where they are versus maybe doing more on the RWA mitigation side, which will cost you more in NII over the near-term, but won't trap you into making a rate bet.\nBill Rogers: Erika, I think you've been in all our meetings. These are all the things that we're evaluating. Everything is in a bucket to discuss. And as you noted, I mean, the world changed pretty substantially from March. But it just reaffirmed our desire to have this flexibility. And going back a little bit to the independents question, remember, we sort of got this large capital benefit. But we always have this - part of getting that benefit was the expense of creating the independents over the long term, as you just highlighted that. So, that - to us, that was always a really good trade-off in terms of creating that flexibility. So, I don't want to speculate today as to we're going to go left or we're going to go right, other than to say, I think you've encapsulated almost perfectly in your question all the alternatives we would consider and their trade-offs to every single one. There's not one perfect path, there are trade-offs to all of them. And we're going to make the decisions that are in best long-term interest of our shareholders. That's going to be our North Star and the guiding post as we think through this and factor in all the environment that we exist today, and that will exist tomorrow with everything that you put into your question.\nErika Najarian: Thank you. And my second question is far more boring. On the service charges, Mike, it went down to 150 from like a 240 handle and 249 in the previous quarter - previous March quarter. Was that a onetime reversal? Or is this a new run rate? I know that there was some offset in other income, but just trying to think about the moving pieces for fees from here?\nMike Maguire: Yes. During the quarter, the accrual that we referenced was $87 million, and that's not something that we would expect to continue.\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nMike Maguire: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. You may now go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Morning.\nMike Maguire: Morning, John.\nJohn Pancari: On the commentary you gave to John McDonald's question regarding some incremental pressure and margin in NII in fourth quarter and into the first half, can you maybe help quantify that magnitude of the pressure that you would expect based upon your rate outlook and the balance sheet dynamics? And then secondly, could you possibly unpack the deposit growth assumption and deposit beta assumption that's baked into that? Thanks.\nMike Maguire: John, I'll just maybe give you a sense for the outlook on NIM for the fourth quarter. I think we're - again, as I mentioned, with the deposit betas, creeping, we're at 49%. As you know, as of the third quarter, we were at 44 in the second. We would expect that to continue to worsen a bit. Just as customers continue to reprice a bit, that's obviously slowing. And for the most part, across three or four of our segments is sort of all the way where we think terminal betas might be, but we're still seeing some movement on the consumer side of things. So, I think a little bit of pressure from the betas, again, offset perhaps a bit by some of the credit spread widening that we're seeing. So from a NIM perspective, maybe it's a few basis points. As far as our revenue outlook for the quarter, we have a sense that it's probably worse, 1%, perhaps flat. NII is going to be down a touch and fees will be up a touch. So I'd just sort of maybe leave it at that. As far as the balance sheet sizing, we had a much more significant decline in earning assets during the third quarter, around $18 billion, we would expect that to be much, much smaller in the fourth quarter, so maybe closer to the tune of $5 billion or so. You've got the securities portfolio that's cash flowing at about $3 billion and maybe just a little bit of pressure on loans. So, I think that's probably the math you need.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then secondly, you had a pretty solid remix of the funding base that you discussed a bit on Slide 11, in third quarter, given the, some of the pay down or reduction in the club advances, et cetera. How much more do you think of rationalization of the funding mix do you think there is, in coming quarters as you look at the setup now? Thanks.\nMike Maguire: Yes. I think the third quarter was unique in the amount of remixing that was accomplished. I mean, you saw the student loan portfolio was a big component of that. And that's a pretty low net interest margin contributor. Same thing, the investment portfolio at $3 billion. We took cash down by close to $5 billion. So if you think about that stuff as sort of right at SOFR, really, really thin spreads, and then at the same time taking off the FHLB advances. That was really the driver, that mixing that saw some of the benefit on the NIM and that sort of aided the NII in the quarter. I think in the fourth quarter you're going to see a more sort of traditional March of again I've hit it deposit costs creeping up a little bit higher. Hopefully, again will continue to be successful as we have been around. Thinking about rate paid, I mean, I'm really pleased by how the businesses has been performing. I mean, we've been testing different rate strategies. We've been looking at promo rates. We've looked at exception-based pricing and structure and so that will continue. And so we're going to try to do the best we can to manage that. But I think the mix driver that we saw in Q3 is really a Q3-only opportunity.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. All right. thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Fargo Securities. You may now go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I hear you about the expense guide for next year is 0% to 1%. So, that would be better, and I hear you about taking the tough actions. But then I look at the core efficiency ratio of around 60%, and it's not what investors signed up for when you announced the merger, even recognizing the rate headwinds and other things. I don't think it's where you wanted to be. So, as you embark on what maybe you could call Truist 2.0 as compared to Truist 1.0, how is management changing in terms of the time to make decisions? Truist 1.0 was like selecting best of breed, it seemed to take a long time. Maybe that was slowed down by such a large board, which now is getting reduced. How is Truist 2.0 better on intensity? How is Truist 2.0 better in terms of moving shareholders up the pecking order? And I guess, generally, with all your optimism, Bill, that certainly is not reflected in the share price, and there's a lot of frustrated and disgruntled shareholders out there. So, how can Truist is 2.0 with the $750 million of savings, maybe strategic actions with insurance, intensity and the way you manage, help shareholders more?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Mike, thanks. The intensity is - I don't know what superlative to use other than high. So, the intensity is really good. And what's happened with the cost save program, and we talk about the $750 million in cost saves, but I don't want to diminish the simplification of our business. So, creating these consumer and wholesale towers and creating the simplification of our business, that really has allowed us to move a lot faster. So, I've been really pleased with how the team has embraced this whole process. I mean, leaders are stepping up in really demonstrable ways, getting in front of it and they're making decisions at a much, much faster pace. So, I outlined a bunch of the different consolidation and those type of things. Those would have been more sequential in the past. You sort of do one, you another one, you sort of go through the process. And today, they're all on these great parallel paths. And I think that's going to have a faster, longer-term impact. And look, I mean, to your point, I mean, we're not happy with where the efficiency is now. One of them stated that as publicly possible and we have demonstrable plans. We talked about the overall play on the cost saves. But long-term, that also has to result in better revenue growth. And all the things that we do together of bringing these businesses together, optimizing the balance sheet, creating capacity, creating product and capability, training our teammates, having them lean in, demonstrated net new, all the things that are building in terms of the momentum, those are key. And I can assure you, for our Board, we have presented an improvement plan on the efficiency ratio, long-term improvement plan. And we'll be on that track. I mean, we share your frustration, trust me. But I think we've got now the structure in place, the leadership in place, the commitment, the intensity, support and we're moving fast. And our team can feel it and they've embraced it.\nMike Mayo: Just as a follow-up, since you did present a plan to the Board for the efficiency ratio, I don't think consensus expects much improvement next year. I guess next year is going to be tough to have positive operating leverage. But if you could comment on that. And maybe just a little bit more meat on the bones. You gave a lot, one-third less bank region, one payment business. Any other color you can give on the efficiency. And when you say simplification, I mean, you guys aren't Citigroup, right? It's not like you're in 100 countries. You're in adjacent regional markets where you should be able to be a lot more simple than what happened after the merger. So positive optimal leverage, improvement in efficiency next year, is this really, as you say, a long-term plan?\nBill Rogers: Yes. On the - they're just as with efficiency, there is a positive operating leverage long-term plan in all of our businesses. And part of the simplification allows them to control that destiny and make decisions about that on a faster basis. It will be harder in the first part of next year. I mean, as you know, I mean, you're sort of running off an NII comparison. So that's just the tougher hurdle. But as we get into the latter part of next year, I mean, we're going to see continuous improvement and commitment to that on a long-term basis. So I can't - without sort of a rate forecast and all that, particularly, I can't comment exactly. But I can comment that during the second half of that, of next year, you're going to start seeing a lot of improvement on the operating leverage and going into 2025, we'll be firmly committed and be a really good flight path. And then as you - and then to the simplification things, we'll continue to - it's a really good question. We'll continue to outline some of those. I mean just think about, for example, care centers. I mean, we have a lot of care centers serving a lot of different businesses. In the merger. We needed to bring those all over the transom and have them perform well. We've invested in a lot of technology and we can consolidate care centers. Just think about that as one of dozens and dozens of examples of this component of simplification. So while I agree with you, we're not sort globally in 100 countries or whatever that parallel may have been, but we still have a lot of opportunity to make this company simpler, faster, leaner and more responsive to clients and as you noted, more responsive to shareholders.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may now go ahead.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. Can you guys elaborate on the service charge issue? Was that that something was kind of self-identified? Was it driven by the CFPB? Or - we haven't seen that at peers, least not yet. Can you elaborate what happened there, please?\nBill Rogers: Yes, Matt. This is Bill. Yes. We did that on our own volition. I mean, we've looked at all of our products and offerings. We've listened to a lot of client feedback. We reviewed and changed our protocols with respect to deposit-related fees. And that resulted in refunds that did impact revenue and other expense. I think we're taking just a more contemporary view of sort of where the world is, where the puck is going and making sure that we get ahead that, we're staying in front and creating this clearer path as possible for next year and the continuous improvement we want to make in our business.\nMatt O'Connor: And then how do we think about the run rate of the service charges given these changes? Obviously, we're not going to run rate to $152 million. But I guess would assume it's lower than previous quarters if you implemented changes going forward?\nMike Maguire: Yes. Look, I mean, I think there's been pressure on this item in general, just given the evolution of the service charges on deposits. But I think you can safely assume that the $87 million that we've noted here during the third quarter was a quarter event. So, again, I think you should expect there to be the same style of pressure you've seen on this line item sort of trending in the industry and for Truist, but this particular event wasn't sort of a step functional driver.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. And then just to summarize, I guess, at this point, with the changes that you made and the refunds like how would you frame your approach to service charges? Are you kind of in in the middle terms of being conservative or more on the conservative side? How would you frame the overdraft and the fees overall, approach?\nBill Rogers: Yes, I think we've got a great product in Truist One and that really reflects where we're going. And so we're adding almost all of our new clients to Truist One. I highlighted some of the benefits, some of the things we're doing that. And then migrating some of our back book to Truist One. So, I don't know how to characterize conservative work, but I do know this is purposeful. And I think we've got an incredibly competitive product that has all the right mixes and that it's really, really client responsive, but it's also contributed to our growth. So, while service charges as an overall, as Mike talked, will continue to click down, we're balancing that with growth, adding new clients, expanding relationships. And I think that's sort of the right mix as we think going forward. Those things won't align perfectly quarter-to-quarter. But long-term, I think we're on a really, really good long-term shareholder value building path.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may now go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning Bill. Good morning Mike.\nBill Rogers: Hi Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Bill, can you share with us - when you think about the game plan that you and your peers have had to use post financial crisis in this low interest rate environment, of 0 to 25 basis points, there was a blip in 2018, of course. But now we're in this new rate environment that was really pre-financial crisis, what changes are you - if you are having some changes, what changes are you implementing to win new business in this new rate environment since it's quite a bit different than it was three or four years ago with both commercial and consumer customers, loans, deposits, et cetera?\nBill Rogers: Yes, Gerard. I'm unfortunately maybe of the age to have operated in this environment in the past.\nGerard Cassidy: Same here.\nBill Rogers: Yes, exactly. So, I have some familiarity. This is not unprecedented or new territory. And I think sort of a couple of things. It first starts with - and you highlighted, I mean, the cost of funding is not free. So, the first part starts with all the things we've been talking about, about optimization and demanding more full relationships from our clients and all the things that go along with that. But you have to offer competitive products and capabilities and be leading. And so for us, I highlighted a lot of the metrics, things like net new on consumer side. So we've got a product like Truist One that's really responsive. We're winning the battle with the competitive environment that clients want more than rate paid. You've got - your paid is not the only option. You got to offer more product and more capabilities. So I think we're winning on that front. And then on the commercial and corporate side same thing. We're in the advice business. And if we start that we're in the advice business versus we're in the rate business, we start with a really good framework. So this whole concept of business life cycle, advisory where we are. I highlighted the fact that we're winning on left lead relationships, so we're becoming more important to our clients. We're becoming the go-to with our clients. We're in the first call perspective where you want to be. So I think the changes are just this relevance is so much more important to start with the market share that we enjoy in our core markets, 20%, all the ubiquity and efficiency that comes with that. So this is not new work, but it's a double down on you have to be really good at the job. You have to be really good at advice. You have to really be good in product and capability and the - which, by the way, I think that's going to really work well for Truist. The new definition of winning, I think, fits perfectly into our strategy going forward.\nGerard Cassidy: I appreciate those insights, Bill. And then on credit, maybe this is best answered by Clarke. You guys talked about tightening up, I think, the credit standards a bit. But I'm more interested - we're not worried about you folks. You guys have a good track record of credit underwriting. But can you make any comments about what others might have been doing over the last two or three years, whether it's non-depositories or depositories in lending, and those may be aggressive actions, if there were any? How that could impact your customers? Who - again, you've underwritten fine but maybe they've done something crazy with somebody else, which then the second derivative, you guys get impacted. But Clarke, any color on that, especially compared to prior cycles?\nClarke Starnes: Yes. Gerard, it's a great question. I know we've - my peers and I have talked about this. But I'd say, in general, particularly since the Great Recession, I think the discipline in the industry overall has been really good. And I think the fundamental credit approach despite the low rate environment, I think the industry in general is in a much better place than we were pre-financial crisis, and even the non-bank players generally have done a good job there. So I don't think there's - we don't necessarily see a big shoe to drop. I think the biggest impact we're trying to evaluate through as you shift from a long secular low rate environment to where we are now is, how economic some of those deals were even if you thought your underwriting well, how sustainable will all that be. And we feel really good about where we are. And I'd say generally, the industry as well.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our final question from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nRyan Kenny: Hi. Good morning. So I just want to clarify something on the earlier questions on the NII path. So we heard the comment around not expecting any significant loan portfolio sales from here. But can you give us an update on your current approach to managing the securities portfolio? And specifically, what are your views on potentially repositioning parts of the securities portfolio, especially if more capital is freed up from potential future exits or optionality?\nMike Maguire: Yes. Good morning, Ryan, on the security side, we've - on average, we see $2.5 billion to $3 billion of just cash flow and maturities from the portfolio. I think you should expect that to continue in terms of sort of just some of the drag on the earning asset base. As far as the repositioning, I don't think there's any new news here. I mean, obviously, long rates of sort of been on the rise here. And so we've been tracking the unrealized losses, and we have some incremental disclosure kind of on our current position and the burn down on our capital slide. I think we're constantly evaluating potential strategies and the likes as it relates to the bond portfolio, but nothing new. We did - I'd just say, as we think about this new world we're living in, where these unrealized losses, at least the securities AOCI is a factor in terms of capital, in an effort to manage that potential volatility in the future, we did add some pay-fixed hedges during the third quarter, which we'll see some benefit from to the extent that kind of rates hang where they are or worsen a bit. So we've got about one-third - a little less than one-third of the AFS securities hedged.\nRyan Kenny: Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, on the credit side. Just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of credit quality. And I'm asking because it does look like you've increased your 2023 NCO guide slightly to the higher end of the prior range. Just wondering if you can share what you're seeing under the surface.\nMike Maguire: Yes, Ryan, it's a good question. First, I'd say we haven't established our 2024 guidance yet, but I believe the things that will drive where we go forward are the same considerations we are seeing now coming out of Q3 and going into Q4. And so I would say for us, we are seeing normalization in our consumer area, particularly in the low-end consumer. So think of our regional acceptance, subprime auto. And then you've also got some defined seasonality in the second half of the year that's impacting Q4 outlook. The other piece would be on what Bill spoke of earlier and Mike, we're remixing our balance sheet to be more optimal. And so you're seeing more growth in our higher-margin businesses like Sheffield and Service Finance, but they carry higher normal losses. And then I think most importantly, something that we control is our efforts to get ahead of the CRE office risk. So in Q3, we were very intentional about working through moving from just identifying the risk there to actually resolving several of the problem credits. And we took some losses there to do that. And we're anticipating maybe opportunities to do more in Q4. So I think those are the three factors that will impact where losses go.\nRyan Kenny: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Brad Milsaps for any closing remarks.\nBrad Milsaps: Okay. Thanks, Anthony. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist, and we hope you have a great day. Anthony, you can now disconnect the call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Now, before we get into the third quarter results, let's begin as always with our purpose on Slide 4. As we all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. I'd like to take a few minutes just to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose last quarter. Truist is driving positive change by supporting organizations that promote the growth and vibrancy of our communities. In August, we invested $17 million to support affordable housing in Charlotte and career development and economic mobility programs across the state of North Carolina. And just last week, we announced our allocation of $65 million in new market tax credits from the U.S. Treasury's Community Development Financial Institution Fund. This is the 12th time Truist has received an award, which has allowed us to invest $750 million in underserved communities by providing loans with reduced rates of interest and/or non-traditional terms. Over the years, these loans have helped spark economic development and job growth and communities across the regions we serve. I'm really proud of the meaningful work we're doing as a company to have a positive effect on the lives of our clients, our teammates and our communities and, of course, our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. Now, let's turn to some of the key takeaways on Slide 6. Truist reported solid third quarter earnings that met our guidance despite certain discrete non-interest income and expense items that negatively impacted our results. Mike is going to cover those later in the call. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several underlying key themes. On our July earnings call, we discussed our intent to significantly reduce the rate of expense growth at our company, which was followed up with the introduction of our simplification efforts and $750 million cost saves program in September. We're fully committed to delivering on this work. And the reduction in third quarter expenses is evidence of the hard work that's been ongoing throughout the year. We're also managing our balance sheet more efficiently. During the past few earnings calls, I've described how we're focusing on core clients, reducing lower-yielding portfolios and paying down higher cost borrowings, all of which occurred during the third quarter and helped drive our NIM higher by four basis points during the quarter. Moreover, these efforts have increased our CET1 ratio to nearly 10%, which is a level that we believe we can maintain throughout the proposed phase-in period under pending Basel III rules based on our current rate of organic capital growth. Although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels, we are encouraged that our metrics remained relatively stable during the quarter, while we continue to build our loan loss reserve, considering the uncertain economic environment. Lastly, we're making strong progress on our cost saves program and organizational simplification, which we'll discuss in more detail later the call. I'm pleased with our direction, the intensity, and focus and I'm confident in our ability to emerge as a stronger company. While the quarter was solid, we acknowledge there's more work to do as strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future. We view this third quarter performance as a step forward in that direction. So, let's do some more specific work on Slide 7. Net income available to common shareholders was $1.1 billion or $0.80 per share. Merger-related and restructuring charges primarily related to severance associated with our cost saves program hurt EPS by $0.04. Total revenue decreased as expected and was essentially in line with our guidance despite an $87 million discrete impact to service charges on deposits revenue. We're also encouraged that our net interest margin improved four basis points, driven by our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts, including a reduction in FHLB borrowings, a decline in lower-yielding loan balances, and improving new and renewed loan spreads. Adjusted expenses were down 50 basis points and within our guidance range and would have decreased 250 basis points excluding $70 million of higher-than-normal other expense. Average loans decreased 2.5%, primarily due to the sale of the student loan portfolio in the second quarter and our continued repositioning towards higher-return core assets. Average deposits increased modestly as we continue to experience a remixing towards higher-yielding alternatives. We added 29 basis points of CET1 capital in the quarter and increased our ALLL ratio by six basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty. Lastly, we maintained our strong quarterly common stock dividend at $0.52 per share paid on September 1st. So, let's move to our digital update on Slide 8. Digital engagement trends at Truist remain positive, as you can see on the left side of the slide. Mobile app users have grown steadily over the past year, and we're currently focused on driving additional growth through our MobileFirst engagement initiative. From an activity standpoint, digital transactions increased 9% relative to the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by Zelle transactions, which were up 32% over the same period. Due to the rapid growth we've experienced, Digital has quickly become a preferred channel for interacting with Truist. In fact, digital transactions now account for more than 60% of total bank transactions. And while that's certainly positive, Truist has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital, specifically by leveraging what we call T3, which is this concept that touch and technology work together to create trust, and that further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency. As a proof point, recent enhancements to the digital onboarding have helped drive a 19% increase in Truist One funding rates year-to-date, which may in turn lead to additional balances and transaction activity with those new clients. In sum, Truist has solid momentum in digital and I'm highly optimistic about the potential we have to leverage T3 to further expand our digital user base and drive transaction volume. Next, I'm going to cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans decreased 2.5% sequentially, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts, including the sale of our student loan portfolio last quarter and further reductions in lower return portfolios. Excluding the student loan sale, average loans were down 1.1%. Average commercial loans decreased 1.1% primarily due to a 1.5% decrease in C&I balances driven by lower revolver utilization and production. Lower C&I production in our corporate and commercial banking segment reflected a combination of moderately lower demand due to economic uncertainty and greater pricing discipline which contributed to wider spreads on new production and commercial community bank. In our consumer and credit card portfolios, average loans decreased 4.6%, primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and further reductions in indirect auto production. Consumer and card balances were down 1%, excluding the student loan sale. Residential mortgage was essentially flat relative to the prior quarter. We do continue to experience growth in higher yielding portfolios, especially Sheffield in Service Finance. Loan production increased 21% year-over-year at Sheffield and 17% at Service Finance. Overall, we expect average commercial and consumer balances to decline modestly in the fourth quarter, driven by our ongoing mixed shift towards deeper client penetrations, deeper relationships, the emphasis of lower return portfolios and the effects of continued economic uncertainty. Let's move to the deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits were flat sequentially, although we continued to experience remixing within the portfolio, as clients saw higher rate alternatives. Noninterest bearing deposits decreased 3.9% and currently represent 30% of total deposits compared to 31% in the second quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of last year. Within our segments, average deposits were down 1% in corporate and commercial banking and relatively flat in consumer banking and wealth due to the effects of quantitative tightening and availability of higher rate alternatives. We continue to deepen our relationships with Consumer Banking and Wealth Clients, especially in payments. Net new checking account production has been positive for three quarters in a row. We're also seeing solid adoption of our flagship Truist One checking product. In addition, small business deposits were up sequentially, and August was the strongest month for net new small business checking account production in the last three years. Deposit costs continue to rise during the third quarter, though at a slower pace. Interest-bearing deposit cost increased 38 basis points sequentially, down from a 55 basis point increase in the prior quarter. Our interest-bearing cumulative deposit beta was 49%, up from 44% in the second quarter due to the presence of higher rate alternatives and ongoing mixed shift from noninterest-bearing accounts into higher yielding products. Going forward, we'll continue to maintain our balanced approach, being attentive to our client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value for them outside of rate paid. Now, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results in a little more detail. Mike? Great. Thanks Mike. And I'll conclude on Slide 18. So looking beyond the third quarter, our transformation into a simpler, more profitable company is underway. We're driving swift and meaningful actions to simplify our organization, which include key organizational changes. So, for example, in the recent weeks we've streamlined our commercial and community banking regions from 21 to 14, realigned several overlapping units into a unified commercial real estate business. We merged our consumer payments and wholesale payments businesses into a single Enterprise Payments organization, which will help us to accelerate payments activity more effectively across Truist. There have been a number of team consolidations within our consumer and small business banking lines of businesses. We've also realigned nine teams under our enterprise operational services to drive efficiencies across our support team serving the whole organization. All of these changes are part of our $750 million cost saves program, which is well underway and designed to drive better service for our clients and limit adjusted expense growth to flat up 1% in 2024. Although we're focused on reducing the rate of expense growth, we will continue to invest in our risk management organization and ability to maintain strong asset quality metrics. While there are many changes happening inside Truist, we've not lost focus on our core consumer and commercial businesses, which is an area that will continue to see significant investment. Net new checking account production has been positive for the first three quarters of this year, and we're on track to continue positive net news for the whole year. During the quarter, we acquired more than 39,000 households through our digital channel. We're also maintaining momentum in wealth, where net organic asset flows have been positive in nine of the past 10 quarters. Client satisfaction scores were stable or increased across most RSPB channels during the third quarter. In the corporate and commercial, new left lead transactions were up 45% year-over-year. Lastly, our wholesale payments pipeline is up 10% year-over-year. We're also seeing strong improvement in client sentiment amongst commercial clients, reflecting product and digital investments that we've already made. As a company, we're also operating our balance sheet more efficiently, thanks to our focus on core clients, deemphasizing lower-return portfolios and paying down higher cost debt. We're building capital, and we feel confident in our ability to satisfy the requirements proposed in the Basel III Endgame rules with the proposed phase-in periods, while preserving our strategic flexibility with TIH. In conclusion, we're making progress and we're doing what's necessary to improve our financial performance to meet your high expectations and, of course, ours. I am truly optimistic about Truist, and I know we're well-positioned for the future. Our teammates are really performing at a high level, and they are committed to serving our clients, caring for each other and capitalizing on our great growth markets, I am really proud of our teammates. Before we move to Q&A, I also want to publicly thank the eight members of our Board of Directors who plan to retire at the end of this year. I'm deeply grateful for their years of service and meaningful contributions to our company. Truist literally exists due to their leadership and confidence. Following these retirements, our Board will consist of 13 members, including 12 Independent Directors who are well-positioned to oversee and advance our strategic plans during this period of rapid industry transformation. So with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you, and we look forward to the Q&A. Yes, Ken, good morning and thanks for that. As you can imagine, I don't want to comment on any rumor or speculation. But to your question, think about the reason we did the opportunity with standpoint. I mean what we wanted to do is exactly what you highlighted in your question is to create this financial and strategic flexibility for both Truist for TIH. We wanted to establish value in the business, and the business is growing. I mean, we've been able to hire and retain talent. So we feel really good about what's happening in the core insurance business. We wanted to make sure that the insurance business had flexibility to continue to grow and then that Truist has an opportunity to respond so whatever may happen. I mean, we're obviously in a market that's got lot of uncertainty to it, and we just want to retain that strategic and financial flexibility. So there's not one thing. There's not like a queue. If something happens, we do this, But we want to just continue to reserve this flexibility and continue to apply it to both the bank and the insurance business. Yes. As I said, there isn't a particular trigger point. We just want to make sure that we retain that flexibility and we're constantly looking at everything that you just talked about and factoring that into the decision-making. This is something that we sort of continually keep in front of ourselves, we keep in front of the Board. But I think the intentionality - I mean, reason we did this is we're allowed to have this conversation around flexibility. Okay. Thanks. Maybe the only thing to add to that, Mike, is just particularly in the areas that we've seen really good growth like Sheffield and Service Finance, we'll do more securitization. So, we'll create more velocity around those things on our balance sheet, which I think are great. So, continue the production, continue to acquire new clients but increase velocity. And we'll look at that with other parts of our portfolio. So, I think Mike said it right, I mean it's not a major power shift. But this optimization strategy, our team has really embraced, and I think we just continue to have more opportunities, I'm going to say, around the edges but maybe more significant that as we move forward. And you saw that reflected in the NIM this quarter. Good morning. Erika, I think you've been in all our meetings. These are all the things that we're evaluating. Everything is in a bucket to discuss. And as you noted, I mean, the world changed pretty substantially from March. But it just reaffirmed our desire to have this flexibility. And going back a little bit to the independents question, remember, we sort of got this large capital benefit. But we always have this - part of getting that benefit was the expense of creating the independents over the long term, as you just highlighted that. So, that - to us, that was always a really good trade-off in terms of creating that flexibility. So, I don't want to speculate today as to we're going to go left or we're going to go right, other than to say, I think you've encapsulated almost perfectly in your question all the alternatives we would consider and their trade-offs to every single one. There's not one perfect path, there are trade-offs to all of them. And we're going to make the decisions that are in best long-term interest of our shareholders. That's going to be our North Star and the guiding post as we think through this and factor in all the environment that we exist today, and that will exist tomorrow with everything that you put into your question. Yes. Mike, thanks. The intensity is - I don't know what superlative to use other than high. So, the intensity is really good. And what's happened with the cost save program, and we talk about the $750 million in cost saves, but I don't want to diminish the simplification of our business. So, creating these consumer and wholesale towers and creating the simplification of our business, that really has allowed us to move a lot faster. So, I've been really pleased with how the team has embraced this whole process. I mean, leaders are stepping up in really demonstrable ways, getting in front of it and they're making decisions at a much, much faster pace. So, I outlined a bunch of the different consolidation and those type of things. Those would have been more sequential in the past. You sort of do one, you another one, you sort of go through the process. And today, they're all on these great parallel paths. And I think that's going to have a faster, longer-term impact. And look, I mean, to your point, I mean, we're not happy with where the efficiency is now. One of them stated that as publicly possible and we have demonstrable plans. We talked about the overall play on the cost saves. But long-term, that also has to result in better revenue growth. And all the things that we do together of bringing these businesses together, optimizing the balance sheet, creating capacity, creating product and capability, training our teammates, having them lean in, demonstrated net new, all the things that are building in terms of the momentum, those are key. And I can assure you, for our Board, we have presented an improvement plan on the efficiency ratio, long-term improvement plan. And we'll be on that track. I mean, we share your frustration, trust me. But I think we've got now the structure in place, the leadership in place, the commitment, the intensity, support and we're moving fast. And our team can feel it and they've embraced it. Yes. On the - they're just as with efficiency, there is a positive operating leverage long-term plan in all of our businesses. And part of the simplification allows them to control that destiny and make decisions about that on a faster basis. It will be harder in the first part of next year. I mean, as you know, I mean, you're sort of running off an NII comparison. So that's just the tougher hurdle. But as we get into the latter part of next year, I mean, we're going to see continuous improvement and commitment to that on a long-term basis. So I can't - without sort of a rate forecast and all that, particularly, I can't comment exactly. But I can comment that during the second half of that, of next year, you're going to start seeing a lot of improvement on the operating leverage and going into 2025, we'll be firmly committed and be a really good flight path. And then as you - and then to the simplification things, we'll continue to - it's a really good question. We'll continue to outline some of those. I mean just think about, for example, care centers. I mean, we have a lot of care centers serving a lot of different businesses. In the merger. We needed to bring those all over the transom and have them perform well. We've invested in a lot of technology and we can consolidate care centers. Just think about that as one of dozens and dozens of examples of this component of simplification. So while I agree with you, we're not sort globally in 100 countries or whatever that parallel may have been, but we still have a lot of opportunity to make this company simpler, faster, leaner and more responsive to clients and as you noted, more responsive to shareholders. Yes, Matt. This is Bill. Yes. We did that on our own volition. I mean, we've looked at all of our products and offerings. We've listened to a lot of client feedback. We reviewed and changed our protocols with respect to deposit-related fees. And that resulted in refunds that did impact revenue and other expense. I think we're taking just a more contemporary view of sort of where the world is, where the puck is going and making sure that we get ahead that, we're staying in front and creating this clearer path as possible for next year and the continuous improvement we want to make in our business. Yes, I think we've got a great product in Truist One and that really reflects where we're going. And so we're adding almost all of our new clients to Truist One. I highlighted some of the benefits, some of the things we're doing that. And then migrating some of our back book to Truist One. So, I don't know how to characterize conservative work, but I do know this is purposeful. And I think we've got an incredibly competitive product that has all the right mixes and that it's really, really client responsive, but it's also contributed to our growth. So, while service charges as an overall, as Mike talked, will continue to click down, we're balancing that with growth, adding new clients, expanding relationships. And I think that's sort of the right mix as we think going forward. Those things won't align perfectly quarter-to-quarter. But long-term, I think we're on a really, really good long-term shareholder value building path. Thanks Matt. Hi Gerard. Yes, Gerard. I'm unfortunately maybe of the age to have operated in this environment in the past. Yes, exactly. So, I have some familiarity. This is not unprecedented or new territory. And I think sort of a couple of things. It first starts with - and you highlighted, I mean, the cost of funding is not free. So, the first part starts with all the things we've been talking about, about optimization and demanding more full relationships from our clients and all the things that go along with that. But you have to offer competitive products and capabilities and be leading. And so for us, I highlighted a lot of the metrics, things like net new on consumer side. So we've got a product like Truist One that's really responsive. We're winning the battle with the competitive environment that clients want more than rate paid. You've got - your paid is not the only option. You got to offer more product and more capabilities. So I think we're winning on that front. And then on the commercial and corporate side same thing. We're in the advice business. And if we start that we're in the advice business versus we're in the rate business, we start with a really good framework. So this whole concept of business life cycle, advisory where we are. I highlighted the fact that we're winning on left lead relationships, so we're becoming more important to our clients. We're becoming the go-to with our clients. We're in the first call perspective where you want to be. So I think the changes are just this relevance is so much more important to start with the market share that we enjoy in our core markets, 20%, all the ubiquity and efficiency that comes with that. So this is not new work, but it's a double down on you have to be really good at the job. You have to be really good at advice. You have to really be good in product and capability and the - which, by the way, I think that's going to really work well for Truist. The new definition of winning, I think, fits perfectly into our strategy going forward."

            "name": "Mike Maguire",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin with net interest income on Slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent, net interest income decreased 1.6% linked quarter primarily due to lower average earning assets and higher deposit costs. Although net interest income was down linked quarter, we are encouraged that the decline was slower than the 6.1% decrease observed in the second quarter as deposit betas increased at a more moderate pace. Reported net interest margin increased 4 basis points after declining for two consecutive quarters. NIM stabilization reflected our ongoing balance sheet optimization initiatives, including: focusing on our core clients, improving spreads on new and renewed loans, reducing lower-yielding loan portfolios and paying down higher cost wholesale borrowings, including FHLB advances, which were down about $20 billion on average compared to the second quarter. Turning to non-interest income on Slide 12. Fee income decreased $185 million or 8.1% relative to the second quarter. The decline was primarily attributable to lower insurance income, which decreased $142 million sequentially due to seasonality. Insurance production is typically lowest in the third quarter and highest in the second. Insurance fundamentals remain strong, driven by new business growth, improved retention and favorable pricing, all of which contributed to 6.3% organic revenue growth on a like-quarter basis. Service charges on deposits were down $88 million in the third quarter due primarily to $87 million of client refund accruals that were driven by changes we made to our deposit fee protocols. Investment banking and trading income was lower by $26 million, while other income increased $38 million primarily due to higher income from other investments. Fee income was flat on a like-quarter basis as higher insurance income and higher other income were offset by lower service charges and lower investment banking and trading income. Next, I'll cover non-interest expense on Slide 13. Reported non-interest expense was flat sequentially as lower adjusted expense was offset by a $21 million increase in merger-related and restructuring expense, driven mostly by severance and facilities rationalization. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our July guidance range of flat to down 1%. The decrease in adjusted expenses was driven by lower personnel expense and reduced professional fees and outside processing expense, partially offset by higher other expense. The increase in other expense included $70 million of costs arising from the previously mentioned client deposit service charge refund accruals as well the settlement of certain litigation matters, including a settlement and patent licensing agreement, which resolved the USAA patent infringement lawsuit. If you excluded these items, adjusted expenses declined by 2.5% linked quarter. The work associated with our gross cost saves program is well underway as we will discuss on Slide 14. In September, we announced a $750 million gross cost saves plan that will be achieved over the next 12 to 18 months. The cost saves will include $300 million from reductions in force, $250 million from organizational realignment and simplification and $200 million from technology expense reductions. Since these initiatives were announced in mid-September, we have already realigned significant elements of our organizational and operational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities. The work we're doing includes optimizing spans and layers to improve organizational design health, consolidating redundant functions, restructuring select businesses and geographic simplification, all of which will result in reductions force over the next couple of quarters. In addition, we are aggressively managing third-party spend, reducing our corporate real estate footprint and rationalizing technology spend. Based on the latest information available, we still expect one-time costs associated with the cost saves program to range from 25% to 30% of gross cost saves. We also continue to project the cost saves program will help us manage adjusted expense growth to 0% to 1% in 2024, which is net of natural expense growth driven by inflation and other factors. Moving to asset quality on Slide 15. Asset quality metrics continued to normalize in the third quarter, but overall remain manageable. Non-performing assets were unchanged linked-quarter, while early-stage delinquencies increased four basis points sequentially as increases in our consumer portfolios were partially offset by declines in commercial. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which represents 1.7% of total loans. We're pleased that non-performing and criticized and classified office loans increased only modestly linked-quarter, while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from 6.2% at June 30, up to 8.3% at September 30. Our net charge-off ratio decreased 3 basis points to 51 basis points, reflecting the prior quarter impact of the student loan sale, partially offset by increases in our CRE and consumer lending portfolios. [Total] reserves as provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by $92 million. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.49%, up 6 basis points sequentially and 15 basis points year-over-year due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we have tightened our risk appetite in select areas, though we maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality, long-term clients. Turning to capital now on Slide 16. Based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules, we feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements under the proposed phase-in periods. Truist added 29 basis points of CET1 capital in the third quarter through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined RWA management. With a CET1 ratio of 9.9%, Truist remains well capitalized relative to our new minimum regulatory requirement of 7.4%, which took place on October 1. As a company, we are strongly committed to building capital and achieving a CET1 ratio of approximately 10% by the end the year. The projected trajectory for our CET1 ratio does incorporate headwinds from the pending FDIC assessment, which is now expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter. Our primary capital priorities are supporting the organic growth needs of new and existing core clients and the payment of our $0.52 per share common dividend. We have no plans to repurchase shares over the near-term and we will continue to allow previous acquisitions to mature. RWA management continues to be disciplined as we allocate less capital to certain businesses, though we have been very clear that our balance sheet is open to core clients. In addition, we continue to believe that Truist's capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings is a distinctive advantage. We estimate that our residual 80% ownership stake provides greater than 200 basis points of additional capital flexibility. The table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our AOCI. Based on estimated cash flows in today's forward curve, we would expect the component of AOCI attributable to securities decline from $13.5 billion at the end of the third quarter to $9.7 billion by the end of 2026 or a decline of 28%. Finally, as it relates to the proposed rules for a long-term debt requirement, we estimate that Truist's binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately $13 billion. We are confident that we will meet the proposed requirements at both the bank and holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phase-in period. Now, I will review our updated guidance on Slide 17. Looking into the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be flat or to decline 1% from 3Q 2023 GAAP revenue of $5.7 billion. We expect linked-quarter improvement in non-interest income due to higher insurance, service charges on deposit income, and investment banking and trading income, partially offset by lower mortgage and other income. Net interest income is likely to remain under some pressure due to our smaller balance sheet and modest NIM compression. Adjusted expenses of $3.5 billion are expected to decline 3.5% due to lower personnel and other expenses. In April, we stated that our 2023 expense guidance excluded expenses associated with TIH independence readiness. Previously, we've not called out these costs because they totaled only $20 million through the first nine months of 2023, including $9 million in the second quarter and $11 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect these expenses to approximate $35 million, which are excluded from our 4Q 2023 expense guidance. For the full year 2023, we expect revenues to increase by approximately 1.5%, which is at the midpoint of our previous revenue guidance of up 1% to 2%. Our guidance includes the $87 million client refund accrual that negatively impacted fees in the third quarter. Full year 2023 adjusted expenses are still on track to increase 7%. This includes $70 million related to the legal settlements and client deposit service charge refunds, but excludes the $55 million of TIH Independence readiness costs for 2023. In terms of asset quality, we have tightened our guidance from a range of 40 to 50 basis points to approximately 50 basis points for the full year, which includes the impact of the student loan sale. Finally, we expect our tax rate tax rate - effective to approximate 18% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis compared to 19% and 21% previously. Now, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Yes, good morning, John. We obviously did see some pressure this quarter, actually probably a little bit better than we expected and that we talked about during the second quarter. We do expect to continue to see some pressure in the fourth, and frankly, even into the first half of 2024. And I think that just has to do with the rate path. We have an expectation that we think we've seen our last hike, and we don't have a cut in forecast until July of next year. We have two cuts in the second half. And so as betas - sort of, again, the good news is, are slowing down, and we feel like grinding a bit lower, we should still feel a little bit of pressure there. We're trying to combat some of that pressure. We've been very intentional around how we're managing rate paid across our client base. We're beginning to see some nice progress as it relates to new and renewed credit spreads. We're repricing some of the fixed rate loans. So the good news is, is while there's pressure, it's moderating, but we still do see that pressure into early next year. Yes. I can start there, John. I think Bill may want to weigh in, too. Hard to say. I mean, we said on the 750. It's kind of 12 to 18 months. I mean, I think if you think about two-thirds plus or minus being recognized next year, maybe it's a little more than that. That's how we're thinking about the math there. And that would again, John, give us the confidence that we have to make sure we manage expense growth to less than 1%. You asked about TIH readiness costs as well. We're not ready to talk about 2024 yet there. We will give you more visibility to that when we guide for the full year in January. Good morning. Yes. Ebrahim, I think the way I'd answer that question is, a lot of the action we're taking, actually right now and in the rest of the fourth quarter and early next year around, for example, some of the organizational design and health and some of the reductions in force, you'll see that come into the run rate relatively quickly. Same goes for some of the realignment of businesses. Those have different flavors. In certain cases, if we significantly restructure a business, like as a good example, we discontinued our middle market agency trading business earlier this year. That was a pretty quick adjustment to run rate. Other adjustments we're making maybe take place throughout the course of next year. And then technology spend, which as you recall is a pretty significant component of our cost savings plan. That has a variety of flavors as well. So I'd say for the most part, you're going to see pretty good progress on run rate adjustment sort of as we exit 2023 and enter 2024. And you'll see, I think, just sort of continuous improvement throughout the course of the year. I think we got after the lowest hanging fruit pretty quickly. Ebrahim, the student portfolio was not a strategic asset for us. It was less profitable. There have been other businesses within even our C&I business, for example, that we didn't feel like we're as highly as strategic. We've talked a lot about correspondent mortgage and some of our national indirect lending businesses. So, I think that we have a pretty good line of sight to it. I think going forward, it's just much more around optimization, right? And being more disciplined in how we select opportunities, how we price opportunities. We're seeing that come through in our results as well. But there's not, I don't think a significant shoe to drop on portfolio sales and those types of things. Yes. During the quarter, the accrual that we referenced was $87 million, and that's not something that we would expect to continue. Yes. Morning, John. John, I'll just maybe give you a sense for the outlook on NIM for the fourth quarter. I think we're - again, as I mentioned, with the deposit betas, creeping, we're at 49%. As you know, as of the third quarter, we were at 44 in the second. We would expect that to continue to worsen a bit. Just as customers continue to reprice a bit, that's obviously slowing. And for the most part, across three or four of our segments is sort of all the way where we think terminal betas might be, but we're still seeing some movement on the consumer side of things. So, I think a little bit of pressure from the betas, again, offset perhaps a bit by some of the credit spread widening that we're seeing. So from a NIM perspective, maybe it's a few basis points. As far as our revenue outlook for the quarter, we have a sense that it's probably worse, 1%, perhaps flat. NII is going to be down a touch and fees will be up a touch. So I'd just sort of maybe leave it at that. As far as the balance sheet sizing, we had a much more significant decline in earning assets during the third quarter, around $18 billion, we would expect that to be much, much smaller in the fourth quarter, so maybe closer to the tune of $5 billion or so. You've got the securities portfolio that's cash flowing at about $3 billion and maybe just a little bit of pressure on loans. So, I think that's probably the math you need. Yes. I think the third quarter was unique in the amount of remixing that was accomplished. I mean, you saw the student loan portfolio was a big component of that. And that's a pretty low net interest margin contributor. Same thing, the investment portfolio at $3 billion. We took cash down by close to $5 billion. So if you think about that stuff as sort of right at SOFR, really, really thin spreads, and then at the same time taking off the FHLB advances. That was really the driver, that mixing that saw some of the benefit on the NIM and that sort of aided the NII in the quarter. I think in the fourth quarter you're going to see a more sort of traditional March of again I've hit it deposit costs creeping up a little bit higher. Hopefully, again will continue to be successful as we have been around. Thinking about rate paid, I mean, I'm really pleased by how the businesses has been performing. I mean, we've been testing different rate strategies. We've been looking at promo rates. We've looked at exception-based pricing and structure and so that will continue. And so we're going to try to do the best we can to manage that. But I think the mix driver that we saw in Q3 is really a Q3-only opportunity. Yes. Look, I mean, I think there's been pressure on this item in general, just given the evolution of the service charges on deposits. But I think you can safely assume that the $87 million that we've noted here during the third quarter was a quarter event. So, again, I think you should expect there to be the same style of pressure you've seen on this line item sort of trending in the industry and for Truist, but this particular event wasn't sort of a step functional driver. Yes. Good morning, Ryan, on the security side, we've - on average, we see $2.5 billion to $3 billion of just cash flow and maturities from the portfolio. I think you should expect that to continue in terms of sort of just some of the drag on the earning asset base. As far as the repositioning, I don't think there's any new news here. I mean, obviously, long rates of sort of been on the rise here. And so we've been tracking the unrealized losses, and we have some incremental disclosure kind of on our current position and the burn down on our capital slide. I think we're constantly evaluating potential strategies and the likes as it relates to the bond portfolio, but nothing new. We did - I'd just say, as we think about this new world we're living in, where these unrealized losses, at least the securities AOCI is a factor in terms of capital, in an effort to manage that potential volatility in the future, we did add some pay-fixed hedges during the third quarter, which we'll see some benefit from to the extent that kind of rates hang where they are or worsen a bit. So we've got about one-third - a little less than one-third of the AFS securities hedged. Yes, Ryan, it's a good question. First, I'd say we haven't established our 2024 guidance yet, but I believe the things that will drive where we go forward are the same considerations we are seeing now coming out of Q3 and going into Q4. And so I would say for us, we are seeing normalization in our consumer area, particularly in the low-end consumer. So think of our regional acceptance, subprime auto. And then you've also got some defined seasonality in the second half of the year that's impacting Q4 outlook. The other piece would be on what Bill spoke of earlier and Mike, we're remixing our balance sheet to be more optimal. And so you're seeing more growth in our higher-margin businesses like Sheffield and Service Finance, but they carry higher normal losses. And then I think most importantly, something that we control is our efforts to get ahead of the CRE office risk. So in Q3, we were very intentional about working through moving from just identifying the risk there to actually resolving several of the problem credits. And we took some losses there to do that. And we're anticipating maybe opportunities to do more in Q4. So I think those are the three factors that will impact where losses go."

            "content": "Yes. Gerard, it's a great question. I know we've - my peers and I have talked about this. But I'd say, in general, particularly since the Great Recession, I think the discipline in the industry overall has been really good. And I think the fundamental credit approach despite the low rate environment, I think the industry in general is in a much better place than we were pre-financial crisis, and even the non-bank players generally have done a good job there. So I don't think there's - we don't necessarily see a big shoe to drop. I think the biggest impact we're trying to evaluate through as you shift from a long secular low rate environment to where we are now is, how economic some of those deals were even if you thought your underwriting well, how sustainable will all that be. And we feel really good about where we are. And I'd say generally, the industry as well."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Brad Milsaps, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Tarren, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's second quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's second quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings ' Chairman and CEO are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Brad, and welcome to the team. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. I don't think it's a surprise to anybody on this call that the increasing levels of uncertainty in our economy, the impact of interest rates on funding cost, and a new sort of post-March operating environment for our industry are impacting our results and plans. Truist was specifically built to increase our flexibility to respond to any condition to fulfill our purpose and commitment to all stakeholders. Capital and liquidity have taken on an increased focus and although Truist is currently well-positioned. We're also intensely building future flexibility. This environment also challenges us to move faster with greater intensity to tighten our strategic focus and rightsize our expense chassis to reflect the new realities. We also have flexibility in strengthening our balance sheet to support our focus on our unique core client base and market opportunity. These decisions are less incremental and more time-bound than the ones previously made during our shift from integrating to operating. Mike will highlight some of these decisions in his comments and I'll close with some of the underlying momentum. While these changes will be manifested over time, this is not business as usual and reflects an important and significant pivot for Truist and for our leadership team. We'll provide more details about these topics and our second quarter results throughout the presentation. Before we do that, let me start where I always do on slide four on purpose mission and values. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. I'd like to share some of the ways we brought that purpose to life last quarter. In May, we announced the launch of Truist Long Game, our mobile app that leverages behavioral economics to reward clients for building financial wellness at a high-level user set goals, save money and earn rewards that are deposited into a Truist account as they make progress towards their savings goals. Based on early data, users tend to play four to five times a week with strong retention and we've seen positive trends towards new client acquisition. This is also the first product from our Truist Foundry, our very own start-up tasked with creating digital solutions to help meet clients where they are. Truist has also highlighting small-business owners through a small-business Community Heroes initiative which is all about focusing on the small-business owners who worked tirelessly to serve our neighbors, create jobs and build our communities and help drive our economy. Our branch teammates are visiting and connecting with tens of thousands of small business clients to say thank you and have a carrying conversation to assist with their unique needs. The response so far has really been excellent and our outreach efforts have helped drive a 31% increase in net new small business checking accounts during the second quarter alone. Lastly, I want to thank our teammates, who dedicated more than 16,000 hours during the second quarter to volunteer in their communities. I'm really proud of the good work our company and our teammates are doing to live out our purpose and to make a difference in the lives of their clients, teammates and communities. So let's turn to the second quarter performance highlights on slide six. Second quarter results were mixed overall. Net income available to common in the second quarter was $1.2 billion or $0.92 a share. EPS decreased 16% relative to the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a higher loan loss provision and noninterest expense partially offset by higher net interest income. EPS decreased 12% sequentially as higher funding costs pressure net interest income. Total revenue decreased 2.9% sequentially, consistent with our revised guidance, and a 6.1% decrease in net interest income was partially offset by 2.6% increase in fee income led by record results at Truist Insurance Holdings. Adjusted expenses were within our existing guidance range although we are actively working to manage cost even more intensely. Loan balances were relatively stable and we're pleased with the initial progress we've made to reposition the balance sheet for higher return core assets, especially in consumer, though there's always additional work to do. Average deposits were down 2% largely due to client activity in March, the overall deposit trends have stabilized significantly since that time frame and our conversations with our clients and our pipelines have improved. We're also prudently increasing our provision and allowance due to increased economic uncertainty. At the same time, our CET1 capital ratio increased 50 basis points driven by organic capital generation and the sale of a 20% stake in our insurance business. These same factors drove a 5% increase in tangible book value per share for March 31st. Our stress capital buffer increased from 250 basis points to 290 basis points higher than we think our steady state business model warrants, but still a good performance as Truist had the fourth lowest loan loss rates among traditional banks that participate in the stress test reflecting again our conservative credit culture and diverse loan portfolio. We also announced plans to maintain our strong quarterly common stock dividend at $0.52 a share subject to Board approval. Strategically, we continue to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on our core clients and businesses, which is why we made the strategic decision to sell a $5 billion non-core student loan portfolio at net carrying value which has no upfront P&L impact. We're also making solid progress toward shifting our loan mix towards higher return core assets. As we adapt to the current environment, we're highly focused on doubling down on our core franchise, simplifying where it makes sense, rationalizing our expenses, and building capital, all of which will address later in the presentation. So moving to the digital and technology update on slide seven. Digital engagement trends remain positive, reinforcing the importance of continued investment in digital due to its close association with relationship primacy client experience and account growth. As a proof point, we recently enhanced our digital on-boarding experience through a series of platform enhancements resulting in higher conversion rates for new applications, faster funding and higher average digital account balances. Our growing mobile app user base is also driving increased transaction volumes. Digital transactions grew 5% sequentially and now account for 61% of total bank transactions. Zelle transactions increased 12% compared to the first quarter and now account for one-third of all-digital transactions at Truist, which underscores the importance our clients place on our payments and money movement capabilities. Retail digital client satisfaction scores have also returned to their pre-merger highs. We are proud of our third-place ranking in the Javelin 2023 Mobile Banking Scorecard. From an overall client experience and technology perspective, we continue to enhance our capability set that includes recent improvements to our cloud-based self-service digital assistant Truist Assist since implementing these enhancements several months ago, Truist Assist has hosted over 500,000 conversations with more than 380,000 clients and is connected clients to live agents to support more than 100,000 complex needs via LiveChat. Over time, increased utilization of Truist Assist should lead to lower volumes in our call centers. We're also delivering on our commitment to T3, through the launch of our Truist Insights to our small business heroes earlier this month. Truist Insights on power small businesses by providing actionable insights about financial activities, including cash flows, income and expense and proactive balanced monitoring. We first piloted Truist Insights in 2021 and this year alone have generated over 200 million financial insights for more than 4.5 million clients, who are now delivering the best valuable tool to small businesses. This is just one more way we're bringing touch and technology together to build trust and to help our small business clients bank with confidence, where and how they want. Overall, I'm highly optimistic that our investments in innovation and digital and technology will enhance performance and further improve the client experience. Let me turn to loans and leases on slide eight. Loan growth continues to be correlated with the solid progress we've made to shift our loan mix towards more profitable portfolios and core clients while intentionally pulling back from lower-yielding and certain single-product relationships. Average loan balances were stable sequentially as growth in our commercial portfolio was largely offset by lower consumer balances. Commercial loan growth was driven by seasonality and mortgage warehouse lending and continued growth in traditional C&I which is a core area for us. The decline in average consumer balances was primarily due to indirect auto where we've intentionally reduced production, home equity, residential mortgage and student loan balances also declined and I'll provide more details about the sale of the student loan portfolio in a few moments. At the same time, we're seeing strong results from our Service Finance and Sheffield businesses where second quarter production grew 34% and 21% respectively from the year ago quarter. Service Finance continues to perform very well and take market share and consistent with our balance sheet optimization we'll increase our loan sale opportunities to help support its growth. As I mentioned, we made the strategic decision to sell our $5 billion non-core student loan portfolio, which had been running off at a pace of approximately $400 million per quarter. We sold the student loan book in late June and net carrying value with no upfront P&L impact. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce other wholesale funding. The transaction will modestly hurt NII, but boost NIM and balance sheet efficiency, exactly what we should be doing in an environment where cost of capital and funding has increased meaningfully. Moving forward, we'll continue to better focus our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our exposure to single product and indirect clients as well as evaluate ways to increase the velocity overall of our balance sheet. Now let me provide some perspective on overall deposit trends on slide nine. Average deposits decreased $8.7 billion or 2.1% primarily due to seasonal tax payments and outflows that occurred late in the first quarter and were consistent with industry impacts of quantitative tightening. We continue to experience remixing within our deposit portfolio as noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to 31% of total deposits from 32% in the first quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 55 basis points sequentially and our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was 44%, up from 36% in the first quarter due to the continued presence of higher rate alternatives and the ongoing shift from noninterest-bearing accounts to higher-yielding products. We continue to remain a balanced approach in the current environment being attentive to client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value outside of rate paid. Our continued rollout of Truist One and ongoing investments in treasury and payments are the bullseye of our sharpened strategic focus and will remain critical as we look to acquire new relationships, deepen existing ones and maximize high quality deposit growth. Now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail.\nMike Maguire: Great. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with net interest income on slide 10. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 6.1% sequentially as higher funding costs more than offset the benefits of higher rates on earning assets. Reported net interest margin decreased 26 basis points to 2.91% due primarily to an acceleration of interest-bearing deposit betas and mix-shift out of DDA into other high cost alternatives. The lower net interest margin also reflected our liquidity build late in the first quarter, while liquidity remained elevated throughout April and May, it has normalized by June and will provide some modest boost in NIM going forward. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income is still up 7.1%, and core net interest margin is up 13 basis points. This reflects the cumulative benefit we've seen from the rising rates during the cycle, particularly throughout 2022, but now we are losing some of that benefit in 2023. Moving to fee income on slide 11. Fee income rebounded 2.6% relative to the first quarter. Insurance income increased $122 million sequentially to a record $935 million, demonstrating the strength of Truist Insurance Holdings. Year-over-year organic revenue grew by 9.1%, the highest in four quarters, driven by strong new business growth, improved retention and a favorable pricing backdrop. Other income increased $65 million primarily due to higher income from our non-qualified plan and higher other investment income. In contrast, investment banking and trading income decreased $50 million, reflecting lower bond originations, loan syndications and asset securitizations as well as lower core trading income from derivatives and credit trading. Finally, mortgage banking income increased or may decreased $43 million, with most of the decrease related to prior quarter gain on sale of a servicing portfolio. Turning to non-interest expense on slide 12. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $67 million or 1.9% sequentially. The increase in adjusted expenses reflected a $75 million increase in personnel costs due to higher variable compensation and non-qualified plan expense and a $38 million increase in professional fees associated with enterprise technology and other investments. These increases were partially offset by a $41 million reduction and other expenses due to lower operational losses during the quarter. As a company, we have substantial opportunities to operate more efficiently and are committed to generating expense reductions. On the April earnings call, we discussed a strategic realignment within our fixed-income sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain market making activities and services provided by middle-market fixed-income platforms that had an unattractive ROE. We also identified various expense reduction activities that had already been underway, including realigning our LightStream platform to our broader consumer business and ongoing capacity adjustments to market-sensitive businesses such as mortgage. We're actively working to identify and accelerate additional actions that could be implemented over the course of the next 12 to 18 months to generate cost reductions to reflect efficiency opportunities and changing conditions. These actions include taking a much more aggressive approach towards FTE management, realigning and consolidating businesses to advance our long-term strategy, rationalizing our tech spend to drive more efficient and effective delivery and optimizing our operations and contact centers, which will help us transform Truist into a more effective and efficient company. Taken together, we believe these actions will increase our focus, double down on our core, simplify our business, bend the expense curve, and enhance returns for our shareholders. Moving to slide 13, asset quality metrics reflected continued normalization during the second quarter. Nonperforming loans rose 11 basis points primarily due to increases in our CRE and C&I portfolios, though they remain manageable at 47 basis points. While the increase in CRE, nonperforming loans, include some office, these loans are generally paying as agreed. Our net charge-off ratio was 54 basis points inclusive of a 12 basis point impact from the sale of the student loan portfolio, excluding the student loan sale, net charge-offs were 42 basis points up 5 basis points sequentially. We'd also note that the student loan sale had no impact on our provision expense this quarter as the charge-offs taken in conjunction with the sale was essentially equal to the allowance on the portfolio. During the quarter, we also increased our ALLL ratio 6 basis points to 1.43% due to greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we have tightened credit and reduced our risk appetite in select areas though we maintain our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality long-term clients. Next, I'll provide more details on our CRE portfolio, which takes us to slide 14. On June 30th, CRE, including commercial construction represented 8.9% of loans held for investment, while the office segment comprised only 1.6%. We maintain a high-quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. We typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through multiple cycles. Our larger exposures tend to be associated with sponsors that have strong institutional ownership and we have actively managed less strategic exposures out of the portfolio since the close of the merger. Looking at office in particular, the chart at the lower right provides a breakdown of our office portfolio by tenant and Class. Our office exposure tends to be weighted towards multi-tenant Class A properties that are situated within our footprint. All factors that we believe will drive outperformance. In addition, we have a strong CRE team that is highly proactive in working with clients to get ahead of the problems. During the second quarter, we completed a thorough review of the majority of our CRE office exposure. We considered current conditions and client support in our risk rating approach. As a result, a handful of loans were moved to non-accrual, though the preponderance of the clients in exposure are paying as agreed. We believe our actions are prudent in light of current market dynamics and demonstrate our commitment to proactive and early identification and resolution of credit risk. While problem loans have increased in recent months, we believe overall issues will be manageable in light of our laddered maturity profile, conservative LTVs, and reserves which for office totaled 6.2% of loans held for investment. Turning to capital on slide 15. As you can see from the capital waterfall, Truist is well-capitalized and has significant flexibility to respond to potential changes in the risk and regulatory environment. Beginning on the left, CET1 capital increased 50 basis points to 9.6% at June 30th. This was driven by organic capital generation and the completion of the sale of the 20% stake in Truist Insurance Holdings. I would also point out that at 9.6%, we're well above our new regulatory minimum of 7.4% which takes effect on October 1st. We expect to achieve an approximate 10% CET1 ratio by year-end through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined management of RWA growth. This view does contemplate the headwind from the pending FDIC assessment. On top of this, Truist has more than 200 basis points of additional flexibility given the residual 80% ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings. As we look beyond '23, we do expect regulatory and capital requirements to become more stringent and potentially require us to deduct AOCI from our CET1 ratio, while the final form of any regulatory changes remains to be seen Truist is well-positioned to respond due to our strong organic capital generation and the likely phasing periods of any potential new requirement. Specifically, and as shown on the right-hand side of the slide, based on estimated cash flows and assuming today's forward curve, we would expect Truist AOCI to decline by 36% by the end of 2026. Assuming our current rate of organic capital generation remains constant, Truist should generate sufficient capital to offset the estimated remaining impact of AOCI on CET1 over this time period while maintaining the strategic capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings. And now I will review our updated guidance on slide 16. Looking into the third quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be down 4% due to seasonally lower insurance revenue and slightly lower loan balances, which will lead to continued pressure on net interest income, albeit at a slower pace relative to the decline we experienced in the second quarter. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to decline zero to 1% as seasonally lower insurance commissions and our efforts to bend the expense curve will offset several seasonal headwinds like marketing and employee benefits that should change the tailwinds in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 1% to 2% compared to 2022. The decline from our previous outlook for 3% growth is primarily driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit betas, slower loan growth and lower investment banking revenue. Adjusted expenses are expected to increase 7%, which is at the upper end of our previously guided range due to continued investments in enterprise technology and other areas. This excludes the anticipated FDIC surcharge. This is a number that is higher than where we've been targeting, but as we've discussed, we are pursuing a number of actions to reduce costs. In terms of asset quality, our expectation is for the net charge-off ratio to be between 40 and 50 basis points, which includes the impact of the student loan sale. Finally, we expect an effective tax rate of 19% or 21% on a taxable equivalent basis. Now Bill, I'll hand it back to you for some final remarks.\nBill Rogers: Great. Thanks, Mike. So let's conclude on slide 17. We're on the right path and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to provide strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. Our strategic pivot from integrating to operating is well underway. And while the financial benefits of our pivot have been masked by the rapid increase in funding costs and related revenue pressure, we've made significant strategic progress over the past year and showing up in a number of operating metrics across our business. In our Consumer Banking and Wealth segments, Retail and Small Business Banking net new checking production has been positive during four last five quarters, reflecting the success of Truist One and improved retention associated with our increasing client service metrics. Truist One also has many features that appeal to millennials and Gen Z represent 70% of the new client applications. Our Wealth Trust and Brokerage business continues to build momentum as net organic asset flows, which exclude the impact of market value changes have been positive eight of the last nine quarters. We've also steadily improved client satisfaction through the distinctive service provided by our branches and care agents as well as improvements to our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client journey rooms. As a result, our client satisfaction scores were stable to improving across most of our channels during the second quarter, but have been consistently rising over the past year since the integration. In Corporate and Commercial, we continue to focus on left lead loan transactions and the synergies between our CIB and CCB businesses. During the first half of the year, 25% of the left lead transactions closed by Truist were with our CCB clients. We're also making inroads with new CCB clients as 65% of the CCB left leads I just mentioned were new relationships. In equity capital markets, transaction economics have improved approximately 300 basis points on average since the merger. And in wholesale payments, our pipeline is the highest it's been since the merger. Each of these data points reflects our increasing strategic relevance with our clients. In addition, our IRM program, integrated relationship management is off to a great start this year as we've already delivered nearly 50% more IRM solutions year-to-date than during the same period a year ago. Our strong progress demonstrates what is possible post-integration when our teammates can focus their undivided attention on caring for their clients and deepening those relationships. However, just as we're shifting our focus from integrate to operate, the economic landscape shifted from favorable to more challenging. As a result, we too much shift and make tough decisions to fit the realities of today's economic environment and tomorrow's regulatory requirements. This means being more disciplined about where we choose to compete and deploy our capital, whether businesses, clients or products and looking deeper and more -- more structural cost opportunities that exist at Truist. These opportunities exist, but not the primary focus during the integration period where the focus was on creating the best transition possible for clients and teammates. Mike highlighted many of the specifics earlier while the details are critically important, what will ultimately matter to stakeholders is our absolute expense base and growth, and our teams are aligned internally on changing that trajectory. I'm really truly optimistic about the future of Truist as our unwavering foundation of purpose, our talented teammates, leadership in growth markets and diverse business model will continue to drive our momentum and fulfill our potential. So Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Bill. Tarren, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session, as you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to follow-up, of course, it makes sense that the funding cost and slower loan growth is part of the change in the revenue outlook. I'm just wondering as you look forward and you think about that deposit mix and deposit cost trajectory as far as funding cost looking past the second quarter, how do you see that affecting the NII trajectory within that new revenue guide for the third and fourth? Thanks, guys.\nMike Maguire: Hey, good morning, Ken. It's Mike. I'd say as we think about the rest of the year, the same factors that have been driving, I'd say just Average Balance QT primarily in the second quarter, we had a little bit more of an impact from tax payments will continue. The mixing has been pretty consistent too from a noninterest-bearing demand perspective into higher-cost alternatives. We saw a little bit of an acceleration in the first quarter as you'll recall, but this quarter that stabilized a bit. We were down about 5.5% on those balances and remix from I guess 32% to 31%. We would expect that trend to continue as well. I think really the factor as we think about NII trajectory for the third and the fourth quarter has much more to do with sort of the Fed policy track, right, where we had about call it close to 50 basis points average increase in the Fed funds rate in the second quarter which really did have an impact on our betas, in our funding costs, we would expect that to be about half that in the third quarter and further moderating from there.\nKen Usdin: And just on the follow-up, what do you think that means for kind of the view of where you think terminal interest-bearing beta might land?\nMike Maguire: It's tough. We're at 44% today, that's higher than where we expect it to be. I think we -- as recently as a month or so ago expressed an expectation that maybe mid-to-high 40s would be the case. I think certainly piercing 50%, but really hard to pick a number at this point, Ken, to be honest with you, a lot of it I think has to do with how long we're higher for longer.\nKen Usdin: Yeah. That makes sense. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess maybe the first question, Mike, just following up on what -- your response to Ken around just the change in deposit beta expectations even relative to last month. Are they -- like when we think about what you said on deposit beta outlook, are there any real signs that are suggesting that deposit trends are in fact slowing down and the likelihood of the beta -- deposit beta update you provided today is more likely to play-out versus having to change this again next month. I'm just wondering are you seeing any tangible signs on the ground that suggest things are getting better?\nMike Maguire: You know it's -- we look at it on a weekly, monthly basis, Ebrahim. And so, I think, yeah. I mean I think history would say that as we approach and reach this terminal policy rate, we should start to see some moderation in the beta creep. We're starting to see that a little bit, but a month or a few weeks the trend does not make, and so, just being very cautious on the outlook there. I mean at 5.25 going to 5.50, the degree of rate awareness across our client set is very, very high across the industry is very, very high. And so, look I -- and I think that's probably as much as anything driven the miss on betas for the sector so far.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And I guess, a separate question, you've talked a lot -- both you and Bill, throughout the call around wanting to bend the cost curve and the expense focus. I know you're not giving '24 guidance today, but as we think about the opportunity there, I'm just wondering if you can put some framework around what we should expect around what this entails with regards to just quantifying it.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. I'll take that. And without again trying to sort of provide specific guidance because we have a lot of things that we're working on. If you think about sort of the buildup, so the buildup was related to things that are investing to build a large financial institution, and then we had some unique onetime things to us, that are things like pension accounting and then we had acquisitions and part of that. So to say a couple of things, I mean, we're clearly at an inflection point in the growth rate. So the growth rate is going to change materially and you can sort of see that by our guidance for the year relative to where we are right now. So that will give you an impression of where we think the third and fourth quarter will be from a growth perspective. And I think similarly sort of on an absolute basis for the balance of this year, we'd expect to see some of that absolute level of expenses coming down, but the real change comes in the structural opportunities that Mike talked about, the things that we're working on. So we can bend the curve in lots of ways that are incremental, but I think the big opportunity for us is sort of the fundamental components in terms of how our company is structured, how it runs, what the chassis looks like, what are the businesses that we're in. And that's the work that we're doing, and that's the big work of post-integration to running the company in a way that reflects the current environment. So, what I would say, maybe I'll use the word appreciably. So expenses will be down appreciably. And as we get into this latter part of this year, we'll provide a lot more guidance and thought about 2024.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: For our next question we'll turn to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. And I apologize in advance if it feels like everyone's asking the same question, but I think it's important for investors to have clarity. Mike, just on the net interest income trajectory, I apologize that we're asking you to spoon-feed it to us, and for everybody could model it later, but investors are really thinking about what the exit rate for the fourth quarter will be -- and potentially overlay your net interest income sensitivity that you disclosed in your Q which at down 100 basis points, just down 70 basis points would imply pretty good stability from fourth quarter levels. So I guess I'm wondering from the 3, 6, 7, and 9, what is the range of NII outcomes that you expect for the fourth quarter and do you agree with -- that notion that if the Fed does cut 100 basis points, which a lot of investors are putting in their models, there is going to be relative stability in terms of your net interest income power next year?\nMike Maguire: Yeah. No, Erika, don't mind at all -- the follow-up question here. So a couple of things, yes. I mean, look, we are according to our NII sensitivity disclosure, relatively neutral and I'd say based on where we are in the cycle and how in particular betas are performing, we're probably even a little bit more liability sensitive to that then that and you see that in our results. We're not currently contemplating a cut this year, and when we talked about our expectations in the middle of June, we were thinking about a cut as early as this year, we've updated our rate view to a -- up 25 at the next meeting and then holding until probably mid '24. So that probably is what's influencing our revenue guide for the rest of this year and especially the NII component, but yeah, I mean, just to get to your question, if we saw it down 100, that would absolutely be a stabilizing force and would be a nice tailwind for our NII based on how we're positioned.\nErika Najarian: And within guide -- go ahead, Bill.\nBill Rogers: Hey, Erika. No, let me just add a couple of things, because we're really talking about sort of betas and NII and we also need to shift talk about client and client activity, which is also an important part of it. So the tailwind that we're creating about net, net deposit growth expansion, IRM, primacy with relationships and then on the pricing side, I mean we're starting to see some of that pricing flexibility, particularly on the commercial side. So spread over SOFR probably 20 some plus basis points quarter-to-quarter. So the ability to be more relevant to our clients reposition our portfolio to reflect that be in higher returning, quite frankly taking some market share, where others are backing off, we're leaning into some opportunities that have a greater return for. So in addition to all the betas and the other components, there's just a lot of really good underlying client activity that's tailwind.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And just a follow-up question and then I'll step aside. Mike, I guess, let me ask this a different way within the down or up one to two in terms of adjusted revenue, what is the NII outlook there -- embedded there?\nMike Maguire: Yeah. No problem. So, our expectation is that in the third quarter with a single rate hike -- our -- it will continue on a downward trajectory but at a much more moderate pace, call it half of what we saw in the second quarter. And I think you would expect the pressure to decline even further in the fourth quarter.\nErika Najarian: Perfect. Thank you.\nMike Maguire: Talking about NII, yeah. You got it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Thanks so much. Just one quick follow-on to this discussion regarding the noninterest-bearing component. I know you mentioned earlier that you expect the noninterest-bearing to remix just to stabilize here and I'm just wondering in your NII outlook where are you expecting noninterest-bearing to trend and where do you feel that, that will stabilize? Thanks.\nMike Maguire: It's been remixing at about 1% a quarter for us that was about $7 billion in average balance, and 5.5% in the quarter. I would expect that trend to continue at that rate. We spent a lot of time last quarter talking about where that might ultimately land. I think there's a chance that that rate of a percent or whatever 5% to 6% a quarter does begin to moderate some here. Bill and I both talked about sort of maybe it's a mid-20s terminal mix of DDA, but even now I think is in many respects and estimate and trying to rely on pre-pandemic and even pre -- back to the pre-GFC proxy. So, Betsy, I don't know that helps or not, but we are assuming that DDA will continue to decline in the third and the fourth quarter, again, the second quarter is a little tougher because of the tax payments and the likes.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just shifting the conversation a little bit towards the capital. I see -- your slide 15 on the significant capital momentum and flexibility that you've got, maybe you could just frame for us how you're thinking about what's the right level for you as we're thinking through what regulation could come through here next week supposedly, we're going to have some new proposals come out and then give us a sense as to buyback capacity and where you're thinking about that at this stage? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yeah, Betsey. This is Bill. So I think the position right now as we continue to build. And so, the targets are developing, more information is coming, and we'll know more over the next 90 days in terms of different proposals and impact on us. And really what this slide was meant to do rather than show sort of an absolute level or a target was really to show the flexibility and the organic creation of capital that we have. So we start from a good position of 9.6 will be organically at 10 end of this year without sort of doing anything dramatic related to risk-weighted assets sort of staying on the process that we're on. And then we just have a lot of flexibility that the AOCI sort of runs off, and then we have -- and we just have other flexibility. So we'll know more as it develops. But I think we're in left lane of capital accretion and we'll stay in that mode until we're not. And that same thing applies to any buybacks or whatnot. We sort of have to understand where the stopping point is before we make any comment about buybacks. And today, that would be short-term, not on the table as we're building capital.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thanks and appreciate that AOCI burn down. Very helpful. Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yeah.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. The floor is yours.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I want to recognize that accelerated capital pass CET1 10% by year-end. So certainly progress with capital. But otherwise, Bill, I need help in understanding how you can say you're on the right path. One, you had a merger, an end-market merger, an end-market merger predicated on cost synergies, and here we are over three years later and your efficiency ratio in the second quarter is 63% worse than peer. Second, your new guide is for '23 operating leverage -- negative operating leverage of 500 basis points to 600 basis points and to build the revenue guide was lowered by 500 basis points in your expense guide, what's the high-end of your prior range, your personnel expenses are up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year. And then three, you talked about bending the cost curve, but over the past three years, you've mentioned when I hood was open, you said let's invest more than it was investing more for growth. Now I hear you say you're investing more in enterprise tech. So, from the merger is predicated on cost synergies, the guide is for big negative operating leverage, you are still spending more. So I understand the employee should be happy. They are being paid more. The customers are happy. You have strong relationships. The communities are happy. You're immersed in them. But the shareholders, I think, I can safely say are not happy, I mean, not happy about the expense growth, and they're not happy about the negative operating leverage. And it just seems like -- I love you personally, but I just wonder if you've just been a little too soft and not taking the tougher actions like some of your peers have. So correct my logic or thinking or my observations, if you would.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Mike, and appreciate the love, but right back at you. So I think -- so a couple of things. One is maybe a challenge a little bit the merger was predicated on cost saves alone. Remember the merger was predicated on opportunity as well, an opportunity in our markets, and we want to make sure that we're well positioned to take advantage of those. So when I talk about sort of being on track, I don't want you to think that, that satisfaction about where we are from an expense side. Building the infrastructure for a large company in this environment was more expensive than we anticipated, so there's just no doubt about that. And, but to that point, I think we're at a really good inflection point. And that inflection point is a pivot. The intensity I can assure you hear around expenses, but not just expenses, but just redesigning the chassis. I mean, there are lots of easy things you can do. You can do hiring freezes and those type of things and we're underway on all that, and you'll start to see some of that in the next couple of quarters, but our commitment is to really underchange the fundamental structure and the business model that results of this. So there are certain businesses. We talked about student loan would be an example that we're we've been supporting from an expense standpoint that just doesn't fit into our strategy and doesn't make sense, so we'll evaluate other parts of our business and other parts of our support structure that are part of that. You could argue we should have been doing that faster. I think that's a legitimate push, and I accept that, but I don't want to think that it's not happening. And that focus is intense, but it is about trying to create more permanent change than structural. I mean let's make the next quarter lower. Let's really change the fundamental structure of the company from an expense standpoint. You've seen me do it before, and you know we can do it again. So my confidence comes from the fact that we've got a team that's committed to this, and the plans that I see and the focus that we have. This is an inflection point from that standpoint in this quarter.\nMike Mayo: So you mentioned you'll come back with some plan for 12 to 18 months. And I know, look, I know you wanted to have positive operating leverage in the environment worked against you partly and you acknowledge there are some other things internally. But it looks like it's going be tough to get positive operating leverage in 2024. Is that something you're going to shoot for? And when do we hear about these new expense plans over the next 12 to 18 months? You gave us a laundry list earlier and what sort of magnitude might that be?\nBill Rogers: Yes. We'll start talking about that in the next couple of quarters, Mike, and how they fit into the overall structure. As I've said to you before, I mean we have -- every business unit has a positive operating leverage plan. I mean that's what we've asked them to do is to create plans that are unique to their businesses, but what we need to do in addition is that sort of the enterprise positive operating leverage focus. 2024, we'll just have to see how it plays out. I mean there's a lot of economic factors that will determine that. So I'd say, not throwing in the towel, so to speak, but we just have to see where some of the economics layout as it relates to that. So if we're in a different rate environment, we're in a different investment banking environment, we're in a different -- then I'll have a different view on that. But as we sit here today, that's -- it's a tough climb, but what we want to do is build that capacity for the long-term.\nMike Mayo: And then last short follow-up. I asked this with everybody, the NII guide is much lower for you and for others. Do you think you've captured it all here? I mean do you lead the year at that kind of fourth quarter level and that say? Or do you see more downside after that?\nMike Maguire: As far as the year is concerned, look, we've flipped to this higher for longer. The new guide reflects how betas are performing. So I think we feel like we've got it for the year. As far as trajectory and trough and '24, it's just -- I think it really is going to be rate path and policy dependent, so long as we're at these rates and for longer betas are going to keep creeping. Now the good news is we are seeing -- and Bill mentioned there's some improvement on things like credit spreads and repricing assets, et cetera. But I think so long as we stay at whatever 5.25%, 5.5% or there's risk, if there's a second hike for sure, Mike, to our outlook. But no, I think we've got Q3 and Q4 pretty well pegged.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn McDonald: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about credit. Could you talk a little bit about the asset quality trends you saw this quarter? What drove the increase in nonperformers, particularly around C&I and CRE?\nBill Rogers: John, I'll turn it over to Clarke, but just -- there's not a trend. So a lot of idiosyncratic things, but let me turn it over to Clarke to do a little more detail.\nClarke Starnes: Yes. Thanks, Bill, and thanks, John. So I would just say we had a number of moving pieces this quarter from a credit perspective and a lot of that was an intentionality around actively managing the portfolio. So the takeaways I would give you are. First, we had really solid consumer performance overall with lower NPLs and losses versus our forecast, so the consumer is holding up really well. So where we did see some of the impact, to your point, is in the C&I and CRE books. From a C&I standpoint, we did see some uptick in NPLs and losses, but what I'd tell you is it's more episodic. There's no particular trend or segment issue, as Bill said, and we're coming off really low historical numbers, and so even where we are today would be lower than our long-term numbers. But as far as the NPL increase, most of that was driven by an intentional focus on CRE office. So what we did is we did an intense loan-by-loan review of our -- almost our entire book. So I would just give you some color on Q1 and our community bank, we looked at every -- we looked at all office loans greater than $2 million and in Q2, we looked at everything over $25 million, so we've done a loan-by-loan review with the vast majority of all of our CRE office. That included updated risk assessments and view evaluation. So we work really, really hard to make sure we're not kicking the can down the road and we understand where we are. So as a result of that, we put a few loans on nonaccrual. I would tell you that the predominance of those loans are actually current . They're swapped to maturity from a rate standpoint, and they've got good economic risk. But we're trying to stay focused on their ability to exit at maturity, and so we're looking and making sure we fully understand that, so that drove the increase in NPLs. And then we did recognize that with six bp increase in our allowance. And so our office allocation is up six point overall, so we feel really good about that. So again, I would say the takeaway is worked really hard to make sure we have good visibility in the portfolio. And the good news is our overall guidance for losses really didn't change. We included our student loan impact for Q2, but we maintain otherwise, our loss guidance for the year.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, Clarke. What should we think about in terms of maybe the charge-off trajectory in the back half of the year that's embedded in the guidance relative to the 42, I guess, jumping off point here.\nClarke Starnes: Yes. Again, we're very confident we'll be within the range of 40 to 50 for the entire year. And I would just remind you all that the second half of the year is always seasonally high in our Consumer businesses, particularly in our subprime auto, and so that's why you see the range stay in the 40 to 50 range, so it will be higher than Q2, but within the guidance we've given you.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. On the efficiency side of things, I know I heard you around the efficiency program that you're working on and looking to bend the cost curve. How should we think about long-term efficiency for the company? As you're looking at this program, as you're looking at this quarter being the inflection and the -- you're apparently clearly looking at across businesses. How should we think about what the prudent, what the appropriate efficiency ratio is from a long-term perspective that you're likely to target here? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Hey, John, this is Bill. I'll take that. What I said was, obviously, is that the expense growth is going to decrease materially, so that's what we're going to see. And then the absolute expense base related to our businesses. I think the way to think about it, and this was very similar sort of how we came out of the merger is we should be sort of top quartile efficiency ratio. So the efficiency ratio is kind of be a bit determined by a little bit of the market conditions where rates are. But our business model, our construct, things that we're engaged in, I think rather than sort of honing in on a specific number because I think that's sort of boxes you in, so to speak, in terms of business mix and those type of things. I think really hone in on the expectation from shareholders ought to be that we ought to be sort of top quartile from an efficiency ratio given the opportunities that we have, both on the revenue side, and then the diversity and construct of our business mix.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Thanks, Bill. That's helpful. And then on the credit side, I appreciate the color you just gave around the non-accruals. Can you give us your thoughts around additional reserve additions here? Is it likely that you still see some incremental build there? And then what -- where does the commercial real estate reserves stand right now, the ratio and the same for the office commercial real estate reserve? Thanks.\nClarke Starnes: Hey, John. This is Clarke. While we're comfortable with our reserve levels right now based on what we know today, obviously, CECL's life of loan, given what you know today, obviously, if the economic outlook deteriorates any further or we do see additional deterioration beyond what we believe we've seen and forecasted today around the portfolio performance or risk attributes. You could see some additional incremental build, but I would not expect to see any sort of large build or hockey stick type. So I think it would be more incremental if we see some. And then as far as did say the CRE office reserve is 6.2% overall, I would remind you all, we have about 40% of our portfolio with our small loans and our wealth and CCB segments, which carries higher reserves. So we've got -- but I think are really strong reserves against where I think the fundamental risk is in the office side and then our total CRE allocation right now is 240.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Clarke, you were talking about what's going on here in commercial real estate. And can you give us some further color on when you look at the nonaccrual increase in commercial real estate? Is it because the owners of these properties are losing tenants? Is it more the value of the properties have fallen and therefore the loan to values are out of sync? And then as part of the answer, how are you guys working to resolve working with your customers to resolve these issues?\nClarke Starnes: Great question, Gerard. I would say for us, we take a very strict view of accrual status when we think about whether a loan needs to be on nonaccrual or not. And I would just remind you what I said but majority of the loans that we placed on nonaccrual this quarter in the CRE office segment and C&I, but in the CRE office segment are actually currently -- current from a contractual basis right now because they still have good economic rents. They're hedged on the rate side, and so they're performing on their payments. But we're looking at what might happen at the end of term as the rate impact fully hit after the swaps go off and whether there's any risk in leasing activity and then what it costs to, for example, reposition the property from an operating standpoint or structurally to be sure the loan could be resized at maturity. And so that's what's driving our view of accrual status, so a lot of it is the valuation side unless the sponsor of principle can address these risks. The good news is we're working with our sponsors. We don't see our clients in any way just walking away from the loans. We have long-term relationships there. And so we're looking at things like asking them to refit, bring in more equity, give us an LC, bring us some interest reserves. We may do some AB note splits while as they attempt to sell the property. So we've got a lot of tools in the tool chest and we're working all of those. Our goal is to be early on this and work with as many borrowers as we can. And hopefully, the market will improve and will have good success.\nBill Rogers: And then not to minimize the focus because, I mean, it's acute, but just also remember, 75% of this portfolio is sitting in our markets, so we're sort of a net in migration market. So while they're dealing with current tenants, people are consolidating their office space, all that's happening, we're experiencing that with all of our bars. We also have markets in which there's a lot of in migration, so there's also more new tenants and more opportunities. And it's idiosyncratic, you've got to be in the right building, the Class A, the opportunities and our portfolio arcs to Class A and end market migration market. So again, not to minimize it, but we got -- we have some better opportunities from that side.\nMike Maguire: Very good, Bill.\nGerard Cassidy: One more question, Bill. Yes. Just as a quick follow-up. Mike, when you look at the AOCI burn down, what would accelerate that in terms from an interest rate standpoint, the forward curve is looking for some short-term interest rate cuts early next year. What would bring that number down even faster from an interest rate environment standpoint, what would you have to see?\nMike Maguire: Well, a couple of. I think the positive catalyst even away from rates would be, I guess, in connection with rates would be speeds increasing in terms of the actual cash flow profile. But if you're looking at the rates, we would need to see the long end rally and we'd actually need to see a parallel benefit from mortgage spreads as well. So some of the, for example, rate rally you saw even from the end of the quarter to this to where we are 20, 30 basis points on the 10-year. If mortgage spreads don't come with it, it can lag a bit. But that would be the -- and Gerard thanks for the question because what we tried to lay out on the right-hand part of that slide, frankly, was a pretty conservative burn-down analysis based on today's speeds, which are quite slow and with no benefit from yield curve normalization.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O'Connor: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one more on costs here. I guess how are you thinking about organizing the effort in terms of who's kind of taking responsibility for running it? Are you thinking about bringing in any outside consultants to get kind of a fresh perspective? Or talk about the organization of it. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Matt, maybe at its simplest form, it's me in terms of sort of who's responsible, but our executive leadership team, and we've got a really good focus on this. We've got -- and by the way, we have different third parties helping us with different elements, so they're not an Uber approach because I actually think we need to own it. It needs to be part of the work that we do as a leadership team. But we have a variety of consultants looking on specific areas, so they may be focused on or consolidation of a specific technology or an outsourcing of a particular thing, so they exist as part of the process. But this is an overall leadership team, sleeves rolled up, everybody is in it. Not only line of business up, but most importantly, enterprise across where I think the real efficiencies are achieved and are more permanent as we think about the company.\nMatthew O'Connor: And in terms of how you think about the timing, is this going to be like a one year effort or several year effort, a continuous improvement effort. How are you thinking about that so far? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yes. I mean it's already underway, and it's a continuous improvement. I mean, I think the mentality of structuring the company around our strategic focus and creating a chassis that attaches to it is not a onetime thing. I think that's something that we're constantly doing, constantly looking at again, back to that commitment to sort of be top quartile in terms of how we run the company from an efficient standpoint, so that's both the revenue and the expense part that comes along with that. So it's not a onetime big bang thing because I actually don't think those are permanent. I don't think they stick. This is a philosophy of how we run the company and the approach that we take long-term.\nMatthew O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'll turn the floor back over for any closing remarks.\nBrad Milsaps: Okay. That completes our earnings call today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist, and we hope you have a great day. Tarren, you may now disconnect the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and welcome to the team. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. I don't think it's a surprise to anybody on this call that the increasing levels of uncertainty in our economy, the impact of interest rates on funding cost, and a new sort of post-March operating environment for our industry are impacting our results and plans. Truist was specifically built to increase our flexibility to respond to any condition to fulfill our purpose and commitment to all stakeholders. Capital and liquidity have taken on an increased focus and although Truist is currently well-positioned. We're also intensely building future flexibility. This environment also challenges us to move faster with greater intensity to tighten our strategic focus and rightsize our expense chassis to reflect the new realities. We also have flexibility in strengthening our balance sheet to support our focus on our unique core client base and market opportunity. These decisions are less incremental and more time-bound than the ones previously made during our shift from integrating to operating. Mike will highlight some of these decisions in his comments and I'll close with some of the underlying momentum. While these changes will be manifested over time, this is not business as usual and reflects an important and significant pivot for Truist and for our leadership team. We'll provide more details about these topics and our second quarter results throughout the presentation. Before we do that, let me start where I always do on slide four on purpose mission and values. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. I'd like to share some of the ways we brought that purpose to life last quarter. In May, we announced the launch of Truist Long Game, our mobile app that leverages behavioral economics to reward clients for building financial wellness at a high-level user set goals, save money and earn rewards that are deposited into a Truist account as they make progress towards their savings goals. Based on early data, users tend to play four to five times a week with strong retention and we've seen positive trends towards new client acquisition. This is also the first product from our Truist Foundry, our very own start-up tasked with creating digital solutions to help meet clients where they are. Truist has also highlighting small-business owners through a small-business Community Heroes initiative which is all about focusing on the small-business owners who worked tirelessly to serve our neighbors, create jobs and build our communities and help drive our economy. Our branch teammates are visiting and connecting with tens of thousands of small business clients to say thank you and have a carrying conversation to assist with their unique needs. The response so far has really been excellent and our outreach efforts have helped drive a 31% increase in net new small business checking accounts during the second quarter alone. Lastly, I want to thank our teammates, who dedicated more than 16,000 hours during the second quarter to volunteer in their communities. I'm really proud of the good work our company and our teammates are doing to live out our purpose and to make a difference in the lives of their clients, teammates and communities. So let's turn to the second quarter performance highlights on slide six. Second quarter results were mixed overall. Net income available to common in the second quarter was $1.2 billion or $0.92 a share. EPS decreased 16% relative to the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a higher loan loss provision and noninterest expense partially offset by higher net interest income. EPS decreased 12% sequentially as higher funding costs pressure net interest income. Total revenue decreased 2.9% sequentially, consistent with our revised guidance, and a 6.1% decrease in net interest income was partially offset by 2.6% increase in fee income led by record results at Truist Insurance Holdings. Adjusted expenses were within our existing guidance range although we are actively working to manage cost even more intensely. Loan balances were relatively stable and we're pleased with the initial progress we've made to reposition the balance sheet for higher return core assets, especially in consumer, though there's always additional work to do. Average deposits were down 2% largely due to client activity in March, the overall deposit trends have stabilized significantly since that time frame and our conversations with our clients and our pipelines have improved. We're also prudently increasing our provision and allowance due to increased economic uncertainty. At the same time, our CET1 capital ratio increased 50 basis points driven by organic capital generation and the sale of a 20% stake in our insurance business. These same factors drove a 5% increase in tangible book value per share for March 31st. Our stress capital buffer increased from 250 basis points to 290 basis points higher than we think our steady state business model warrants, but still a good performance as Truist had the fourth lowest loan loss rates among traditional banks that participate in the stress test reflecting again our conservative credit culture and diverse loan portfolio. We also announced plans to maintain our strong quarterly common stock dividend at $0.52 a share subject to Board approval. Strategically, we continue to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on our core clients and businesses, which is why we made the strategic decision to sell a $5 billion non-core student loan portfolio at net carrying value which has no upfront P&L impact. We're also making solid progress toward shifting our loan mix towards higher return core assets. As we adapt to the current environment, we're highly focused on doubling down on our core franchise, simplifying where it makes sense, rationalizing our expenses, and building capital, all of which will address later in the presentation. So moving to the digital and technology update on slide seven. Digital engagement trends remain positive, reinforcing the importance of continued investment in digital due to its close association with relationship primacy client experience and account growth. As a proof point, we recently enhanced our digital on-boarding experience through a series of platform enhancements resulting in higher conversion rates for new applications, faster funding and higher average digital account balances. Our growing mobile app user base is also driving increased transaction volumes. Digital transactions grew 5% sequentially and now account for 61% of total bank transactions. Zelle transactions increased 12% compared to the first quarter and now account for one-third of all-digital transactions at Truist, which underscores the importance our clients place on our payments and money movement capabilities. Retail digital client satisfaction scores have also returned to their pre-merger highs. We are proud of our third-place ranking in the Javelin 2023 Mobile Banking Scorecard. From an overall client experience and technology perspective, we continue to enhance our capability set that includes recent improvements to our cloud-based self-service digital assistant Truist Assist since implementing these enhancements several months ago, Truist Assist has hosted over 500,000 conversations with more than 380,000 clients and is connected clients to live agents to support more than 100,000 complex needs via LiveChat. Over time, increased utilization of Truist Assist should lead to lower volumes in our call centers. We're also delivering on our commitment to T3, through the launch of our Truist Insights to our small business heroes earlier this month. Truist Insights on power small businesses by providing actionable insights about financial activities, including cash flows, income and expense and proactive balanced monitoring. We first piloted Truist Insights in 2021 and this year alone have generated over 200 million financial insights for more than 4.5 million clients, who are now delivering the best valuable tool to small businesses. This is just one more way we're bringing touch and technology together to build trust and to help our small business clients bank with confidence, where and how they want. Overall, I'm highly optimistic that our investments in innovation and digital and technology will enhance performance and further improve the client experience. Let me turn to loans and leases on slide eight. Loan growth continues to be correlated with the solid progress we've made to shift our loan mix towards more profitable portfolios and core clients while intentionally pulling back from lower-yielding and certain single-product relationships. Average loan balances were stable sequentially as growth in our commercial portfolio was largely offset by lower consumer balances. Commercial loan growth was driven by seasonality and mortgage warehouse lending and continued growth in traditional C&I which is a core area for us. The decline in average consumer balances was primarily due to indirect auto where we've intentionally reduced production, home equity, residential mortgage and student loan balances also declined and I'll provide more details about the sale of the student loan portfolio in a few moments. At the same time, we're seeing strong results from our Service Finance and Sheffield businesses where second quarter production grew 34% and 21% respectively from the year ago quarter. Service Finance continues to perform very well and take market share and consistent with our balance sheet optimization we'll increase our loan sale opportunities to help support its growth. As I mentioned, we made the strategic decision to sell our $5 billion non-core student loan portfolio, which had been running off at a pace of approximately $400 million per quarter. We sold the student loan book in late June and net carrying value with no upfront P&L impact. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce other wholesale funding. The transaction will modestly hurt NII, but boost NIM and balance sheet efficiency, exactly what we should be doing in an environment where cost of capital and funding has increased meaningfully. Moving forward, we'll continue to better focus our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our exposure to single product and indirect clients as well as evaluate ways to increase the velocity overall of our balance sheet. Now let me provide some perspective on overall deposit trends on slide nine. Average deposits decreased $8.7 billion or 2.1% primarily due to seasonal tax payments and outflows that occurred late in the first quarter and were consistent with industry impacts of quantitative tightening. We continue to experience remixing within our deposit portfolio as noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to 31% of total deposits from 32% in the first quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 55 basis points sequentially and our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was 44%, up from 36% in the first quarter due to the continued presence of higher rate alternatives and the ongoing shift from noninterest-bearing accounts to higher-yielding products. We continue to remain a balanced approach in the current environment being attentive to client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value outside of rate paid. Our continued rollout of Truist One and ongoing investments in treasury and payments are the bullseye of our sharpened strategic focus and will remain critical as we look to acquire new relationships, deepen existing ones and maximize high quality deposit growth. Now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Great. Thanks, Mike. So let's conclude on slide 17. We're on the right path and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to provide strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. Our strategic pivot from integrating to operating is well underway. And while the financial benefits of our pivot have been masked by the rapid increase in funding costs and related revenue pressure, we've made significant strategic progress over the past year and showing up in a number of operating metrics across our business. In our Consumer Banking and Wealth segments, Retail and Small Business Banking net new checking production has been positive during four last five quarters, reflecting the success of Truist One and improved retention associated with our increasing client service metrics. Truist One also has many features that appeal to millennials and Gen Z represent 70% of the new client applications. Our Wealth Trust and Brokerage business continues to build momentum as net organic asset flows, which exclude the impact of market value changes have been positive eight of the last nine quarters. We've also steadily improved client satisfaction through the distinctive service provided by our branches and care agents as well as improvements to our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client journey rooms. As a result, our client satisfaction scores were stable to improving across most of our channels during the second quarter, but have been consistently rising over the past year since the integration. In Corporate and Commercial, we continue to focus on left lead loan transactions and the synergies between our CIB and CCB businesses. During the first half of the year, 25% of the left lead transactions closed by Truist were with our CCB clients. We're also making inroads with new CCB clients as 65% of the CCB left leads I just mentioned were new relationships. In equity capital markets, transaction economics have improved approximately 300 basis points on average since the merger. And in wholesale payments, our pipeline is the highest it's been since the merger. Each of these data points reflects our increasing strategic relevance with our clients. In addition, our IRM program, integrated relationship management is off to a great start this year as we've already delivered nearly 50% more IRM solutions year-to-date than during the same period a year ago. Our strong progress demonstrates what is possible post-integration when our teammates can focus their undivided attention on caring for their clients and deepening those relationships. However, just as we're shifting our focus from integrate to operate, the economic landscape shifted from favorable to more challenging. As a result, we too much shift and make tough decisions to fit the realities of today's economic environment and tomorrow's regulatory requirements. This means being more disciplined about where we choose to compete and deploy our capital, whether businesses, clients or products and looking deeper and more -- more structural cost opportunities that exist at Truist. These opportunities exist, but not the primary focus during the integration period where the focus was on creating the best transition possible for clients and teammates. Mike highlighted many of the specifics earlier while the details are critically important, what will ultimately matter to stakeholders is our absolute expense base and growth, and our teams are aligned internally on changing that trajectory. I'm really truly optimistic about the future of Truist as our unwavering foundation of purpose, our talented teammates, leadership in growth markets and diverse business model will continue to drive our momentum and fulfill our potential. So Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. Yeah. I'll take that. And without again trying to sort of provide specific guidance because we have a lot of things that we're working on. If you think about sort of the buildup, so the buildup was related to things that are investing to build a large financial institution, and then we had some unique onetime things to us, that are things like pension accounting and then we had acquisitions and part of that. So to say a couple of things, I mean, we're clearly at an inflection point in the growth rate. So the growth rate is going to change materially and you can sort of see that by our guidance for the year relative to where we are right now. So that will give you an impression of where we think the third and fourth quarter will be from a growth perspective. And I think similarly sort of on an absolute basis for the balance of this year, we'd expect to see some of that absolute level of expenses coming down, but the real change comes in the structural opportunities that Mike talked about, the things that we're working on. So we can bend the curve in lots of ways that are incremental, but I think the big opportunity for us is sort of the fundamental components in terms of how our company is structured, how it runs, what the chassis looks like, what are the businesses that we're in. And that's the work that we're doing, and that's the big work of post-integration to running the company in a way that reflects the current environment. So, what I would say, maybe I'll use the word appreciably. So expenses will be down appreciably. And as we get into this latter part of this year, we'll provide a lot more guidance and thought about 2024. Hey, Erika. No, let me just add a couple of things, because we're really talking about sort of betas and NII and we also need to shift talk about client and client activity, which is also an important part of it. So the tailwind that we're creating about net, net deposit growth expansion, IRM, primacy with relationships and then on the pricing side, I mean we're starting to see some of that pricing flexibility, particularly on the commercial side. So spread over SOFR probably 20 some plus basis points quarter-to-quarter. So the ability to be more relevant to our clients reposition our portfolio to reflect that be in higher returning, quite frankly taking some market share, where others are backing off, we're leaning into some opportunities that have a greater return for. So in addition to all the betas and the other components, there's just a lot of really good underlying client activity that's tailwind. Yeah, Betsey. This is Bill. So I think the position right now as we continue to build. And so, the targets are developing, more information is coming, and we'll know more over the next 90 days in terms of different proposals and impact on us. And really what this slide was meant to do rather than show sort of an absolute level or a target was really to show the flexibility and the organic creation of capital that we have. So we start from a good position of 9.6 will be organically at 10 end of this year without sort of doing anything dramatic related to risk-weighted assets sort of staying on the process that we're on. And then we just have a lot of flexibility that the AOCI sort of runs off, and then we have -- and we just have other flexibility. So we'll know more as it develops. But I think we're in left lane of capital accretion and we'll stay in that mode until we're not. And that same thing applies to any buybacks or whatnot. We sort of have to understand where the stopping point is before we make any comment about buybacks. And today, that would be short-term, not on the table as we're building capital. Yeah. Thanks, Mike, and appreciate the love, but right back at you. So I think -- so a couple of things. One is maybe a challenge a little bit the merger was predicated on cost saves alone. Remember the merger was predicated on opportunity as well, an opportunity in our markets, and we want to make sure that we're well positioned to take advantage of those. So when I talk about sort of being on track, I don't want you to think that, that satisfaction about where we are from an expense side. Building the infrastructure for a large company in this environment was more expensive than we anticipated, so there's just no doubt about that. And, but to that point, I think we're at a really good inflection point. And that inflection point is a pivot. The intensity I can assure you hear around expenses, but not just expenses, but just redesigning the chassis. I mean, there are lots of easy things you can do. You can do hiring freezes and those type of things and we're underway on all that, and you'll start to see some of that in the next couple of quarters, but our commitment is to really underchange the fundamental structure and the business model that results of this. So there are certain businesses. We talked about student loan would be an example that we're we've been supporting from an expense standpoint that just doesn't fit into our strategy and doesn't make sense, so we'll evaluate other parts of our business and other parts of our support structure that are part of that. You could argue we should have been doing that faster. I think that's a legitimate push, and I accept that, but I don't want to think that it's not happening. And that focus is intense, but it is about trying to create more permanent change than structural. I mean let's make the next quarter lower. Let's really change the fundamental structure of the company from an expense standpoint. You've seen me do it before, and you know we can do it again. So my confidence comes from the fact that we've got a team that's committed to this, and the plans that I see and the focus that we have. This is an inflection point from that standpoint in this quarter. Yes. We'll start talking about that in the next couple of quarters, Mike, and how they fit into the overall structure. As I've said to you before, I mean we have -- every business unit has a positive operating leverage plan. I mean that's what we've asked them to do is to create plans that are unique to their businesses, but what we need to do in addition is that sort of the enterprise positive operating leverage focus. 2024, we'll just have to see how it plays out. I mean there's a lot of economic factors that will determine that. So I'd say, not throwing in the towel, so to speak, but we just have to see where some of the economics layout as it relates to that. So if we're in a different rate environment, we're in a different investment banking environment, we're in a different -- then I'll have a different view on that. But as we sit here today, that's -- it's a tough climb, but what we want to do is build that capacity for the long-term. John, I'll turn it over to Clarke, but just -- there's not a trend. So a lot of idiosyncratic things, but let me turn it over to Clarke to do a little more detail. Hey, John, this is Bill. I'll take that. What I said was, obviously, is that the expense growth is going to decrease materially, so that's what we're going to see. And then the absolute expense base related to our businesses. I think the way to think about it, and this was very similar sort of how we came out of the merger is we should be sort of top quartile efficiency ratio. So the efficiency ratio is kind of be a bit determined by a little bit of the market conditions where rates are. But our business model, our construct, things that we're engaged in, I think rather than sort of honing in on a specific number because I think that's sort of boxes you in, so to speak, in terms of business mix and those type of things. I think really hone in on the expectation from shareholders ought to be that we ought to be sort of top quartile from an efficiency ratio given the opportunities that we have, both on the revenue side, and then the diversity and construct of our business mix. Good morning. And then not to minimize the focus because, I mean, it's acute, but just also remember, 75% of this portfolio is sitting in our markets, so we're sort of a net in migration market. So while they're dealing with current tenants, people are consolidating their office space, all that's happening, we're experiencing that with all of our bars. We also have markets in which there's a lot of in migration, so there's also more new tenants and more opportunities. And it's idiosyncratic, you've got to be in the right building, the Class A, the opportunities and our portfolio arcs to Class A and end market migration market. So again, not to minimize it, but we got -- we have some better opportunities from that side. Matt, maybe at its simplest form, it's me in terms of sort of who's responsible, but our executive leadership team, and we've got a really good focus on this. We've got -- and by the way, we have different third parties helping us with different elements, so they're not an Uber approach because I actually think we need to own it. It needs to be part of the work that we do as a leadership team. But we have a variety of consultants looking on specific areas, so they may be focused on or consolidation of a specific technology or an outsourcing of a particular thing, so they exist as part of the process. But this is an overall leadership team, sleeves rolled up, everybody is in it. Not only line of business up, but most importantly, enterprise across where I think the real efficiencies are achieved and are more permanent as we think about the company. Yes. I mean it's already underway, and it's a continuous improvement. I mean, I think the mentality of structuring the company around our strategic focus and creating a chassis that attaches to it is not a onetime thing. I think that's something that we're constantly doing, constantly looking at again, back to that commitment to sort of be top quartile in terms of how we run the company from an efficient standpoint, so that's both the revenue and the expense part that comes along with that. So it's not a onetime big bang thing because I actually don't think those are permanent. I don't think they stick. This is a philosophy of how we run the company and the approach that we take long-term."

            "name": "Mike Maguire",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with net interest income on slide 10. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 6.1% sequentially as higher funding costs more than offset the benefits of higher rates on earning assets. Reported net interest margin decreased 26 basis points to 2.91% due primarily to an acceleration of interest-bearing deposit betas and mix-shift out of DDA into other high cost alternatives. The lower net interest margin also reflected our liquidity build late in the first quarter, while liquidity remained elevated throughout April and May, it has normalized by June and will provide some modest boost in NIM going forward. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income is still up 7.1%, and core net interest margin is up 13 basis points. This reflects the cumulative benefit we've seen from the rising rates during the cycle, particularly throughout 2022, but now we are losing some of that benefit in 2023. Moving to fee income on slide 11. Fee income rebounded 2.6% relative to the first quarter. Insurance income increased $122 million sequentially to a record $935 million, demonstrating the strength of Truist Insurance Holdings. Year-over-year organic revenue grew by 9.1%, the highest in four quarters, driven by strong new business growth, improved retention and a favorable pricing backdrop. Other income increased $65 million primarily due to higher income from our non-qualified plan and higher other investment income. In contrast, investment banking and trading income decreased $50 million, reflecting lower bond originations, loan syndications and asset securitizations as well as lower core trading income from derivatives and credit trading. Finally, mortgage banking income increased or may decreased $43 million, with most of the decrease related to prior quarter gain on sale of a servicing portfolio. Turning to non-interest expense on slide 12. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $67 million or 1.9% sequentially. The increase in adjusted expenses reflected a $75 million increase in personnel costs due to higher variable compensation and non-qualified plan expense and a $38 million increase in professional fees associated with enterprise technology and other investments. These increases were partially offset by a $41 million reduction and other expenses due to lower operational losses during the quarter. As a company, we have substantial opportunities to operate more efficiently and are committed to generating expense reductions. On the April earnings call, we discussed a strategic realignment within our fixed-income sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain market making activities and services provided by middle-market fixed-income platforms that had an unattractive ROE. We also identified various expense reduction activities that had already been underway, including realigning our LightStream platform to our broader consumer business and ongoing capacity adjustments to market-sensitive businesses such as mortgage. We're actively working to identify and accelerate additional actions that could be implemented over the course of the next 12 to 18 months to generate cost reductions to reflect efficiency opportunities and changing conditions. These actions include taking a much more aggressive approach towards FTE management, realigning and consolidating businesses to advance our long-term strategy, rationalizing our tech spend to drive more efficient and effective delivery and optimizing our operations and contact centers, which will help us transform Truist into a more effective and efficient company. Taken together, we believe these actions will increase our focus, double down on our core, simplify our business, bend the expense curve, and enhance returns for our shareholders. Moving to slide 13, asset quality metrics reflected continued normalization during the second quarter. Nonperforming loans rose 11 basis points primarily due to increases in our CRE and C&I portfolios, though they remain manageable at 47 basis points. While the increase in CRE, nonperforming loans, include some office, these loans are generally paying as agreed. Our net charge-off ratio was 54 basis points inclusive of a 12 basis point impact from the sale of the student loan portfolio, excluding the student loan sale, net charge-offs were 42 basis points up 5 basis points sequentially. We'd also note that the student loan sale had no impact on our provision expense this quarter as the charge-offs taken in conjunction with the sale was essentially equal to the allowance on the portfolio. During the quarter, we also increased our ALLL ratio 6 basis points to 1.43% due to greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we have tightened credit and reduced our risk appetite in select areas though we maintain our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality long-term clients. Next, I'll provide more details on our CRE portfolio, which takes us to slide 14. On June 30th, CRE, including commercial construction represented 8.9% of loans held for investment, while the office segment comprised only 1.6%. We maintain a high-quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. We typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through multiple cycles. Our larger exposures tend to be associated with sponsors that have strong institutional ownership and we have actively managed less strategic exposures out of the portfolio since the close of the merger. Looking at office in particular, the chart at the lower right provides a breakdown of our office portfolio by tenant and Class. Our office exposure tends to be weighted towards multi-tenant Class A properties that are situated within our footprint. All factors that we believe will drive outperformance. In addition, we have a strong CRE team that is highly proactive in working with clients to get ahead of the problems. During the second quarter, we completed a thorough review of the majority of our CRE office exposure. We considered current conditions and client support in our risk rating approach. As a result, a handful of loans were moved to non-accrual, though the preponderance of the clients in exposure are paying as agreed. We believe our actions are prudent in light of current market dynamics and demonstrate our commitment to proactive and early identification and resolution of credit risk. While problem loans have increased in recent months, we believe overall issues will be manageable in light of our laddered maturity profile, conservative LTVs, and reserves which for office totaled 6.2% of loans held for investment. Turning to capital on slide 15. As you can see from the capital waterfall, Truist is well-capitalized and has significant flexibility to respond to potential changes in the risk and regulatory environment. Beginning on the left, CET1 capital increased 50 basis points to 9.6% at June 30th. This was driven by organic capital generation and the completion of the sale of the 20% stake in Truist Insurance Holdings. I would also point out that at 9.6%, we're well above our new regulatory minimum of 7.4% which takes effect on October 1st. We expect to achieve an approximate 10% CET1 ratio by year-end through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined management of RWA growth. This view does contemplate the headwind from the pending FDIC assessment. On top of this, Truist has more than 200 basis points of additional flexibility given the residual 80% ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings. As we look beyond '23, we do expect regulatory and capital requirements to become more stringent and potentially require us to deduct AOCI from our CET1 ratio, while the final form of any regulatory changes remains to be seen Truist is well-positioned to respond due to our strong organic capital generation and the likely phasing periods of any potential new requirement. Specifically, and as shown on the right-hand side of the slide, based on estimated cash flows and assuming today's forward curve, we would expect Truist AOCI to decline by 36% by the end of 2026. Assuming our current rate of organic capital generation remains constant, Truist should generate sufficient capital to offset the estimated remaining impact of AOCI on CET1 over this time period while maintaining the strategic capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings. And now I will review our updated guidance on slide 16. Looking into the third quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be down 4% due to seasonally lower insurance revenue and slightly lower loan balances, which will lead to continued pressure on net interest income, albeit at a slower pace relative to the decline we experienced in the second quarter. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to decline zero to 1% as seasonally lower insurance commissions and our efforts to bend the expense curve will offset several seasonal headwinds like marketing and employee benefits that should change the tailwinds in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 1% to 2% compared to 2022. The decline from our previous outlook for 3% growth is primarily driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit betas, slower loan growth and lower investment banking revenue. Adjusted expenses are expected to increase 7%, which is at the upper end of our previously guided range due to continued investments in enterprise technology and other areas. This excludes the anticipated FDIC surcharge. This is a number that is higher than where we've been targeting, but as we've discussed, we are pursuing a number of actions to reduce costs. In terms of asset quality, our expectation is for the net charge-off ratio to be between 40 and 50 basis points, which includes the impact of the student loan sale. Finally, we expect an effective tax rate of 19% or 21% on a taxable equivalent basis. Now Bill, I'll hand it back to you for some final remarks. Hey, good morning, Ken. It's Mike. I'd say as we think about the rest of the year, the same factors that have been driving, I'd say just Average Balance QT primarily in the second quarter, we had a little bit more of an impact from tax payments will continue. The mixing has been pretty consistent too from a noninterest-bearing demand perspective into higher-cost alternatives. We saw a little bit of an acceleration in the first quarter as you'll recall, but this quarter that stabilized a bit. We were down about 5.5% on those balances and remix from I guess 32% to 31%. We would expect that trend to continue as well. I think really the factor as we think about NII trajectory for the third and the fourth quarter has much more to do with sort of the Fed policy track, right, where we had about call it close to 50 basis points average increase in the Fed funds rate in the second quarter which really did have an impact on our betas, in our funding costs, we would expect that to be about half that in the third quarter and further moderating from there. It's tough. We're at 44% today, that's higher than where we expect it to be. I think we -- as recently as a month or so ago expressed an expectation that maybe mid-to-high 40s would be the case. I think certainly piercing 50%, but really hard to pick a number at this point, Ken, to be honest with you, a lot of it I think has to do with how long we're higher for longer. You know it's -- we look at it on a weekly, monthly basis, Ebrahim. And so, I think, yeah. I mean I think history would say that as we approach and reach this terminal policy rate, we should start to see some moderation in the beta creep. We're starting to see that a little bit, but a month or a few weeks the trend does not make, and so, just being very cautious on the outlook there. I mean at 5.25 going to 5.50, the degree of rate awareness across our client set is very, very high across the industry is very, very high. And so, look I -- and I think that's probably as much as anything driven the miss on betas for the sector so far. Yeah. No, Erika, don't mind at all -- the follow-up question here. So a couple of things, yes. I mean, look, we are according to our NII sensitivity disclosure, relatively neutral and I'd say based on where we are in the cycle and how in particular betas are performing, we're probably even a little bit more liability sensitive to that then that and you see that in our results. We're not currently contemplating a cut this year, and when we talked about our expectations in the middle of June, we were thinking about a cut as early as this year, we've updated our rate view to a -- up 25 at the next meeting and then holding until probably mid '24. So that probably is what's influencing our revenue guide for the rest of this year and especially the NII component, but yeah, I mean, just to get to your question, if we saw it down 100, that would absolutely be a stabilizing force and would be a nice tailwind for our NII based on how we're positioned. Yeah. No problem. So, our expectation is that in the third quarter with a single rate hike -- our -- it will continue on a downward trajectory but at a much more moderate pace, call it half of what we saw in the second quarter. And I think you would expect the pressure to decline even further in the fourth quarter. Talking about NII, yeah. You got it. It's been remixing at about 1% a quarter for us that was about $7 billion in average balance, and 5.5% in the quarter. I would expect that trend to continue at that rate. We spent a lot of time last quarter talking about where that might ultimately land. I think there's a chance that that rate of a percent or whatever 5% to 6% a quarter does begin to moderate some here. Bill and I both talked about sort of maybe it's a mid-20s terminal mix of DDA, but even now I think is in many respects and estimate and trying to rely on pre-pandemic and even pre -- back to the pre-GFC proxy. So, Betsy, I don't know that helps or not, but we are assuming that DDA will continue to decline in the third and the fourth quarter, again, the second quarter is a little tougher because of the tax payments and the likes. As far as the year is concerned, look, we've flipped to this higher for longer. The new guide reflects how betas are performing. So I think we feel like we've got it for the year. As far as trajectory and trough and '24, it's just -- I think it really is going to be rate path and policy dependent, so long as we're at these rates and for longer betas are going to keep creeping. Now the good news is we are seeing -- and Bill mentioned there's some improvement on things like credit spreads and repricing assets, et cetera. But I think so long as we stay at whatever 5.25%, 5.5% or there's risk, if there's a second hike for sure, Mike, to our outlook. But no, I think we've got Q3 and Q4 pretty well pegged. Very good, Bill. Well, a couple of. I think the positive catalyst even away from rates would be, I guess, in connection with rates would be speeds increasing in terms of the actual cash flow profile. But if you're looking at the rates, we would need to see the long end rally and we'd actually need to see a parallel benefit from mortgage spreads as well. So some of the, for example, rate rally you saw even from the end of the quarter to this to where we are 20, 30 basis points on the 10-year. If mortgage spreads don't come with it, it can lag a bit. But that would be the -- and Gerard thanks for the question because what we tried to lay out on the right-hand part of that slide, frankly, was a pretty conservative burn-down analysis based on today's speeds, which are quite slow and with no benefit from yield curve normalization."

            "name": "Clarke Starnes",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Bill, and thanks, John. So I would just say we had a number of moving pieces this quarter from a credit perspective and a lot of that was an intentionality around actively managing the portfolio. So the takeaways I would give you are. First, we had really solid consumer performance overall with lower NPLs and losses versus our forecast, so the consumer is holding up really well. So where we did see some of the impact, to your point, is in the C&I and CRE books. From a C&I standpoint, we did see some uptick in NPLs and losses, but what I'd tell you is it's more episodic. There's no particular trend or segment issue, as Bill said, and we're coming off really low historical numbers, and so even where we are today would be lower than our long-term numbers. But as far as the NPL increase, most of that was driven by an intentional focus on CRE office. So what we did is we did an intense loan-by-loan review of our -- almost our entire book. So I would just give you some color on Q1 and our community bank, we looked at every -- we looked at all office loans greater than $2 million and in Q2, we looked at everything over $25 million, so we've done a loan-by-loan review with the vast majority of all of our CRE office. That included updated risk assessments and view evaluation. So we work really, really hard to make sure we're not kicking the can down the road and we understand where we are. So as a result of that, we put a few loans on nonaccrual. I would tell you that the predominance of those loans are actually current . They're swapped to maturity from a rate standpoint, and they've got good economic risk. But we're trying to stay focused on their ability to exit at maturity, and so we're looking and making sure we fully understand that, so that drove the increase in NPLs. And then we did recognize that with six bp increase in our allowance. And so our office allocation is up six point overall, so we feel really good about that. So again, I would say the takeaway is worked really hard to make sure we have good visibility in the portfolio. And the good news is our overall guidance for losses really didn't change. We included our student loan impact for Q2, but we maintain otherwise, our loss guidance for the year. Yes. Again, we're very confident we'll be within the range of 40 to 50 for the entire year. And I would just remind you all that the second half of the year is always seasonally high in our Consumer businesses, particularly in our subprime auto, and so that's why you see the range stay in the 40 to 50 range, so it will be higher than Q2, but within the guidance we've given you. Hey, John. This is Clarke. While we're comfortable with our reserve levels right now based on what we know today, obviously, CECL's life of loan, given what you know today, obviously, if the economic outlook deteriorates any further or we do see additional deterioration beyond what we believe we've seen and forecasted today around the portfolio performance or risk attributes. You could see some additional incremental build, but I would not expect to see any sort of large build or hockey stick type. So I think it would be more incremental if we see some. And then as far as did say the CRE office reserve is 6.2% overall, I would remind you all, we have about 40% of our portfolio with our small loans and our wealth and CCB segments, which carries higher reserves. So we've got -- but I think are really strong reserves against where I think the fundamental risk is in the office side and then our total CRE allocation right now is 240. Great question, Gerard. I would say for us, we take a very strict view of accrual status when we think about whether a loan needs to be on nonaccrual or not. And I would just remind you what I said but majority of the loans that we placed on nonaccrual this quarter in the CRE office segment and C&I, but in the CRE office segment are actually currently -- current from a contractual basis right now because they still have good economic rents. They're hedged on the rate side, and so they're performing on their payments. But we're looking at what might happen at the end of term as the rate impact fully hit after the swaps go off and whether there's any risk in leasing activity and then what it costs to, for example, reposition the property from an operating standpoint or structurally to be sure the loan could be resized at maturity. And so that's what's driving our view of accrual status, so a lot of it is the valuation side unless the sponsor of principle can address these risks. The good news is we're working with our sponsors. We don't see our clients in any way just walking away from the loans. We have long-term relationships there. And so we're looking at things like asking them to refit, bring in more equity, give us an LC, bring us some interest reserves. We may do some AB note splits while as they attempt to sell the property. So we've got a lot of tools in the tool chest and we're working all of those. Our goal is to be early on this and work with as many borrowers as we can. And hopefully, the market will improve and will have good success."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Truist Financial Corporation's First Quarter Call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation.\nAnkur Vyas: Thank you, Allay, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's first quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's first quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and recent events, and provide an outlook -- updated outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings' Chairman and CEO are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. I know you have a busy day ahead of you. The first quarter of 2023 was certainly an unusual and maybe even possibly an historic one for our banking industry. I am really extremely proud of our more than 50,000 teammates who leaned into our purpose and continue to care for our clients and stakeholders, reassuring them of Truist's position of strength and commitment to serve them. Throughout the quarter, we continue to experience the benefits of our shift from integrating to operating as evidenced by improved organic production and increasing client satisfaction scores which in our branches has send it to new highs from the weeks after March 9. Based on a volatile and uncertain environment, we successfully demonstrated the strength and resiliency of Truist's diverse business mix, scale and market share, granular and relationship-oriented deposit base and strong capital and liquidity. But as we will also discuss, some of that positive momentum was offset by some higher funding costs and somewhat elevated expenses. Strategically, we continue to take actions to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and at the same time, simplify, consolidate or exit certain activities to improve profitable growth. Mike will share some of those details later in the call. We'll provide more details on the quarter's results and other topical items throughout the presentation. But first, let's begin with our purpose on Slides 4 and 5. And in certain times, it can be easy to focus on the short-term at the expense of the long-term, which is why it's important that we always lead with purpose at Truist. These slides are a powerful reminder that the most effective way to grow over the long-term is to deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. But today, my comments will be on this topic a little briefer to gauge investor interest and other topics. Our purpose statement intentionally begins with the words Inspire. And that's exactly what I witnessed while working closely with our teammates in March. As I mentioned, I was inspired by how our teammates leaned into purpose and care as they held numerous discussions with clients and stakeholders to answer their questions about the banking system to emphasize Truist's financial position and strength and help them move forward with their financial needs. In addition to client care we provided last month, there were many other ways we actualized our purpose throughout the quarter, which we highlight on Slide 5. You can read more about these items and many of our other efforts to build better lives and communities in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, which we published last week. Now I'll walk through our first quarter performance highlights on Slide 7. Quarter performance slide focused mostly on GAAP or unadjusted results given that MOE-related spend (ph) exited our run rate last year. Going forward, we intend to focus primarily on GAAP results with the exceptions of adjusted tangible efficiency and adjusted PPNR since intangible amortization expense remained significant due to the scale of the MOE and has no impact on capital generation. Truist reported first quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $1.05 a share, up 6% like quarter due to strong growth in adjusted PPNR, lower merger cost, partially offset by a more normal provision level compared to a year ago. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, EPS decreased 13%, primarily due to lower net interest income and seasonality. Adjusted PPNR decreased 7% sequentially, consistent with our prior guidance as better than expected fee income due to higher capital markets activity was more than offset by lower net interest income and somewhat higher than expected expenses. Relative to the first quarter of 2022, adjusted PPNR grew 19%, and we delivered 310 basis points of positive adjusted operating leverage, reflecting a good start to the year. Asset quality remains strong and net charge-offs continue to normalize consistent with our expectations. We prudently built our ALLL ratio 3 basis points to reflect a more uncertain economic environment. Balance sheet trends despite all the noise in mid-March were fairly expected and more business as usual, and we'll cover more about loans, deposits, capital and liquidity later in the presentation. So moving to our digital and technology update on Slide 8. Continued investments in progress in digital will be even more critical due to the close relationship between digital engagement, primacy of relationships and deposits. The good news is Truist prioritized digital early in the merger, building the Truist digital experience organically and in the cloud, which allows us to fully-own the digital experience for our clients end-to-end. Our first quarter results reflect our continued investments agility and momentum. In the first quarter, we opened 146,000 deposit accounts digitally, exceeding our internal expectations. We saw a strong growth in digital transactions and Zelle, in particular, underscoring the importance of payments and money movement capabilities to our clients. More broadly, we had an incredibly productive technology quarter as we advance our strategy to reimagine our capability set. In the deposit space, we launched a new data driven deposit pricing engine, which provides personalized relationship based rates for clients during account opening and will allow us to be even more targeted with respect to rate paid. We also enhanced our digital lending capabilities with the launch of our commercial loan dashboard, an industry-leading solution that allows wholesale lending clients to track the status of their loans, upload documents and eventually electronically signed documents. Our goal is to eventually incorporate this dashboard into one view, our desired end-state integrated digital experience across payments, lending and capital markets creating a seamless experience for commercial and corporate clients and to our relationship with Truist. So turning to loans and leases on Slide 9. Loan growth was solid in portfolios targeted for growth and lower portfolios where we've intentionally pulled back. Average loan balances grew 1.7% sequentially while end-of-period balances increased a more modest 50 basis points. The slower growth on an end-of-period basis was intentional and expected and reflects our strategic decision in the second half of last year to reduce production in certain lower return portfolios, including indirect auto and correspondent mortgage while also increasing rates and spreads from ongoing production. C&I balances increased 3.6% on an average basis and 1.8% on an end-of-period basis due to continued growth across CIB and CCB, reflecting the benefits of our capabilities and our markets. Consumer loan balances decreased 60 basis points on average and were down 1% from December 31, reflecting ongoing runoff in student and partnership lending as well as lower indirect auto production. Strategically, we're focusing our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our balance sheet usage with more single product and indirect clients. We're also evaluating ways to increase the velocity of our balance sheet, increasing greater utilization of loan sales and securitization. This allows us to be more impactful and increase returns in businesses such as service finance. Next, I'll provide some perspective on overall deposit trends starting on Slide 10. Despite the unique events of mid-March, average deposit trends during the first quarter were generally consistent with our expectations. Average deposit balance decreased 1.2%, driven by quantitative tightening, inflation and movements to higher rate alternatives. Within the month of March, more deposit flows were concentrated in the period from March 11 to March 18 and have largely been business as usual since including through yesterday. Positive outflows during mid-March were primarily related to CIG and CCB clients. We chose to diversify in the money market mutual funds and in some cases, across multiple bags. These outflows tended to be a higher cost of non-operational deposits. We also experienced deposit inflows as we're both attracting new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients. Retail production continues to improve due to our shift from integrating to operating and leading with the value proposition of Truist One. In the first quarter, Truist saw record new deposit production, including 18% year-over-year uplift in branch account openings with improved client retention driving strong net new account performance. Commercial Community Banking had record new account growth in March, and we've seen good momentum in the first couple of weeks of April as clients are beginning to move money to fund those accounts. More noteworthy than overall deposit flows was the pace of the mix shift from DDA as non-interest-bearing deposits decreased to 32% of deposits from 34% previously. This happened a little sooner than we previously anticipated. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 64 basis points sequentially, contributing to a cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta of 36% so far in the cycle. Deposit betas accelerated relative to the fourth quarter due to the presence of high rate alternatives and the previously mentioned shift from non-interest-bearing DDA into interest-bearing products. We'll continue to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing the value outside of rate paid. Given higher investor interest and additional deposit details, we provided a closer look at our deposit base on Slide 11. Truist has one of the most robust deposit franchises in the banking industry, thanks to three key factors. First, Truist has strong market shares in many of the fastest-growing markets in the U.S. Truist currently ranks first, second or third in deposit share in 17 of the Top 20 markets. Those include cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, D.C., Miami, Tampa, Raleigh-Durham, among others, making us the dominant player in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Second, Truist has a granular retail leading deposit base that is 63% insured and/or collateralized, which is the second highest in our peer group and an important source of stability. In addition, our commercial deposits are diversified across 21 industry groups with no one sector representing more than 10% of corporate and commercial banking deposits. Third, we're highly relationship oriented, as you can see from the table at the bottom of the slide. The average deposit account at Truist has been open for 17 years during which time these relationships have broadened to include multiple products and services. In retail and small business banking, we have over 12 million deposit accounts with an average account balance of 17,000. RSBB deposits are highly granular and 86% of balances are insured. In addition, Truist is the primary bank for the preponderance of those clients. In our Wealth business, 90% of the depositors have investments with Truist Wealth and our Commercial Community Bank 81% depositors have a payments lending or advisory relationship with Truist, with the majority of that related to operating treasury management products. Together, these factors are a source of strength for Truist and for our clients. So now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nMike Maguire: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with net interest income on Slide 12. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 2.8% sequentially as higher funding costs and two fewer days in the quarter more than offset the effects of solid loan growth. Reported net interest margin decreased 8 basis points, while core net interest margin decreased 7 basis points. When you break down the decrease in the core net interest margin, approximately 5 basis points was driven by a shift in the funding mix from DDA and other low cost deposit products into interest-bearing deposits and about 2 basis points was due to our decision to conservatively carry more liquidity during the last few weeks of March. Moving to fee income on Slide 13. Fee income was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter and modestly exceeded our expectations in light of typical seasonal headwinds. Insurance income increased $47 million, largely due to seasonality. Year-over-year organic revenue growth was 4.7%. Mortgage banking income rose $25 million, primarily due to a gain on sale of a servicing portfolio, which was partially offset by MSR valuation adjustments. Income from core mortgage activity was relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. Wealth management income improved $15 million, benefiting from an increase in brokerage commissions, asset flows and higher fees due to rising asset prices during the quarter. Wealth continues to build momentum as net organic asset flows, which exclude the impact of market value changes, were approximately $1 billion for the quarter and have been positive for seven of the last eight quarters. In addition, we were pleased by the modest increase in investment banking and trading income, led by strength in investment grade and high yield bond originations, fixed income derivatives and loan syndications. CIB's performance continues to be aided by two idiosyncratic factors, strategic hiring over the past two years as well as increased integrated relationship management activity. With respect to IRM, capital markets fees from non-CIB clients increased 12% sequentially and were 20% up from first quarter 2022. Other income decreased $56 million, primarily due to lower income from our non-qualified plan. While fee income remains below its potential, our investments in key areas such as insurance, investment banking and wealth will continue to be a source of momentum as markets normalize and as our IRM execution continues to mature. Turning now to Slide 14. Reported non-interest expense declined $31 million driven by a $107 million reduction in merger costs due to the completion of integration activities and a $27 million decrease in amortization expense. The expense reductions I just described were largely offset by $103 million or a 3% increase in adjusted non-interest expense. Expense drivers included a $39 million increase in pension expense and a $23 million increase in regulatory charges due to higher FDIC premiums. We also experienced a $33 million increase in operating losses, which are reflected in other expense due to industry check fraud issues and then operating loss within Truist Insurance recognized prior to completing our transaction with Stone Point. As a company, we are committed to generating expense reductions and have undertaken a number of actions that help bend the expense arc at Truist. Last week, we announced a strategic realignment within our fixed income sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain market-making activities and services provided by our middle markets fixed income platform. This platform was largely focused on MBS-related sales and trading for depositories and had produced an unattractive ROE. This realignment will result in an approximate $50 million run rate expense save with little PPNR impact and enable us to focus more on our core strategy of being a fulsome and premier investment bank for corporates, sponsors and municipal issuers. We're also in the process of realigning our LightStream platforms with our broader consumer business with the goal of bringing the innovation, digital capabilities, efficiencies and cloud-based infrastructure of LightStream to Truist's broader client base. This will reduce the cost of supporting a separate brand and strategy and enhance the experience and primacy with our existing and prospective clients. In addition, we continue to adjust our capacity and focus in mortgage to reflect current challenging market conditions and our own strategic focus on client primacy. These actions, among others, are what drove the $63 million of restructuring charges during the quarter. Furthermore, we've also aligned executive compensation to Truist to shareholder expectations, which I shared with many of you about a month ago. Taken together, we believe these as well as other actions we're taking will increase our focus, bend our expense curve and improve returns for Truist. Moving to Slide 15. Asset quality remained strong in the first quarter, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio. Leading indicators remain favorable. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 15 basis points sequentially and were down 17 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Our NPL ratio was steady at a relatively benign 36 basis points. Net charge-offs increased 3 basis points to 37 basis points, primarily due to C&I and continued normalization in the consumer and are consistent with pre-pandemic levels. We became even more cautious in our outlook regarding CRE fundamentals. And in light of increased economic uncertainty, we prudently increased our allowance by $102 million and increased our ALLL ratio by 3 basis points to 1.37%. In anticipation of an increasing risk environment, we are also tightening credit and reducing our risk appetite in selected areas while maintaining our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality, long-term clients. Next, given high investor interest, I will dive deeper into CRE on Slide 16. As we began the integration process to become Truist, we were very intentional about retaining the diversification benefits of the merger. To achieve this outcome, we carefully evaluated our various portfolios, including CRE to ensure we fully understood their combined risk profile and to establish how we would manage them going forward. While we did not wholly pause CRE production during this process, we did deemphasize it until we aligned on a single go-to-market strategy. As a result of this decision, Truist CRE portfolio actually decreased by 2.2% from the end of 2019 to the end of 2022, whereas our median peer grew CRE 21%. Our disciplined focus on diversification has also resulted in less CRE concentration and risk relative to our peer group. At year-end, CRE represented 11% of our loan mix compared to 12% at our median peer and the office segment comprised 1.6% of our loan book versus 1.9% at our median peer. We maintain a high-quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. We typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through the cycle. Our exposure tends to be large CRE with strong institutional sponsorship, and we have reduced our exposure to smaller CRE. The quality of our CRE portfolio is also reflected in the Federal Reserve's annual stress test results. Our disciplined approach to CRE is reflected in our asset quality metrics, which remain solid. In the lower right, you can see a snapshot of our office portfolio, which had approximately $5 billion in outstanding balances as of March 31 and another area where Truist has been risk averse and highly selective over the past two years. Our office portfolio tends to be weighted towards Class A properties within our footprint, which we believe will perform better than large urban markets. We have a great CRE team that is very proactive in working with clients to get ahead of any problems. Criticized trends have increased over the past few months, but we believe overall problems will be manageable given our conservative LTVs, our reserves and the laddered maturity profile of the portfolio. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 17. Our CET1 ratio increased from 9% to 9.1% as approximately 20 basis points of organic capital generation was partially offset by 12 basis points of CECL phase-in. While not included in our CET1 ratio, AOCI improved by $1 billion from December 31 to March 31. Of our $12.6 billion of after-tax OCI, as of March 31, $8.5 billion is related to our AFS portfolio, $2.5 billion is related to the frozen portion of the HTM portfolio, and $1.5 billion is related to our pension plan. We would expect the securities portfolio related OCI to decrease by $2 billion to $2.5 billion by the end of 2024 or by approximately 20%, and that's in a static rate environment. In addition, this accretion will be a powerful driver of higher tangible book value per share over time, a small glimpse of which we saw this past quarter with tangible book value increasing 8%. On April 3, we also closed on the sale of a 20% minority stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which added approximately 30 basis points to our capital ratios and provides flexibility in the future. Additionally, we declared a strong common dividend of $0.52 per share, which was paid on March 1. Finally, Truist continues to have significant access to liquidity and a very robust liquidity managed process that includes internal and external stress testing as well as real-time monitoring of our liquidity position. Our average consolidated LCR improved to 113% during the first quarter and remains well above the regulatory minimum of 100%. We have access to approximately $166 billion of liquidity, including cash, FHLB borrowing capacity, unpledged securities and discount window capacity. As a reminder, government and agency obligations represent 97% of our securities portfolio, which produces about $2.5 billion to $3 billion of cash flow per quarter. During the quarter, we conservatively increased our cash position from $16 billion as of December 31 to $33 billion at the end of March, funded largely by callable FHLB advances and would expect that to somewhat normalize going forward given that activity has stabilized. More broadly, we do expect regulatory requirements around capital and liquidity to heighten, but believe we're in a strong position to respond given the already high expectations for an institution of our size, the strategic and financial flexibility we have as a company in the orderly phase-in period that would likely accompany potential changes. Now I will review our updated guidance on Slide 18. Looking into the second quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be relatively stable compared to the first quarter as a modest decline in NII is offset by seasonally stronger insurance revenue. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 1% to 2% linked quarter primarily as a result of higher incentive-based compensation from insurance revenue growth. For the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 5% to 7% compared to 2022. The decline from our previous outlook is driven almost entirely by a lower net interest income outlook given higher deposit and funding costs. Adjusted expenses are still expected to increase between 5% and 7%. As I indicated earlier, we remain focused on taking actions throughout the year to reduce costs. Excluded from our adjusted expense outlook are two items. First, we are not including the impact of any potential incremental FDIC surcharge or assessment. After we receive clarity, we'll provide an update on estimated impact. Secondly, there will be some one-time costs occurring in 2023 and 2024 tied to preparing Truist Insurance Holdings to transition its operating model to be more independent, which is consistent with its new capital structure. These expenses directly correlate to realizing significant value in the business over time. We will not adjust for these expenses in our results, but we will provide transparency. Our goal is still to produce positive operating leverage and positive adjusted PPNR growth for the full year, excluding these two items. The degree of difficulty has increased relative to January given higher funding costs. Our expectations for the net charge-off ratio to be between 35 basis points for the full year is unchanged. Lastly, excluding discrete items, we now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20%, which translates to approximately 22% on a taxable equivalent basis due to our adoption of recent accounting guidance regarding the amortization of new market tax credits. This change simply shifts contra revenue and other income to the tax expense line and has no impact on the bottom line. Now I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\nBill Rogers: Great. Thanks, Mike. So to conclude on Slide 19, Truist is on the right path. And I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to produce strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. As we began to shift from integrating to operating several quarters ago, we also made a strategic decision to focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and are most synergistic with our core strengths. Since that time, we focus on product solutions and distinctive experiences that are most relevant to our primary consumer and deposit households into our commercial, corporate and high net worth clients while reducing our investment in businesses and clients that are less strategically relevant with respect to returns and relationship opportunities. We believe these changes are consistent with where the banking industry is likely to go from here. We're already realizing the early benefits of this shift. For instance, first quarter net new consumer checking account production was among the best we've seen since becoming Truist, driven by our continued focus on core deposit clients, the attractiveness of new products, including Truist One and improve retention as well as flight to quality. Branch checking account production has increased 13% since the launch of Trust One, and as I said earlier, has accelerated up to 18% compared to a year ago in the first quarter. The steady improvement we've seen in client satisfaction has been driven by the distinct service our branch and care agents provide as well as improvements in our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client journey rooms. As I indicated earlier, I'm really proud to care of our teammates -- care our teammates provided to our clients in March, and this is reflected in higher voice of client scores during the last few weeks of the quarter. Lastly, we continue to advance our integrated relationship management program by establishing long-term growth targets for our most strategic IRM partnerships, details of which I shared in December. Relative to the first quarter of last year, these strategic partnerships have grown revenues by 35%. At the same time, we acknowledge that the environment is tougher and strong balance sheet and expense management will remain critical for our stakeholders. In closing, while uncertainty has increased, Truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix, dynamic markets, conservative credit (ph) culture, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, strong profitability profile and our strong risk-adjusted capital position. I am truly optimistic about the future of Truist as our more than 50,000 talented teammates build on our momentum to create distinctive client experiences and deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. So with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.\nAnkur Vyas: Great. Thank you, Bill. Allay, at this time, will you explain to our listeners how they can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.\nOperator: Of course, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to start just on the deposit front, good color you gave in terms of the relationships. You mentioned in the deck that end-of-period was down 2%, and some of that was seasonal. So just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on just how you saw deposits end the quarter and if you've seen stabilization and what kind of outlook you just see for the flow and mix of deposits from here? Thanks.\nMike Maguire: Hey. Good morning, Ken. It's Mike. That's right. We saw really throughout the course of the quarter, relatively stable flows. Actually, if you think about sort of where we saw our balances evolve throughout the first-two months of the quarter, very typical. We saw some seasonal outflows related to public funds. We saw the expected impact of qualitative tightening, which we've seen throughout the previous couple of quarters. And so we're probably down about 1% or so. And then in the last month of the quarter, we really saw continued public fund outflows. We saw a little bit of higher rate pursuant behavior. We saw people cycling into money market accounts to a higher extent. We saw some of our wealth clients cycle into investment accounts and ended down about 2% for the quarter. I'd say the bulk of the money [indiscernible] happened during that week that Bill mentioned in our opening remarks. As far as outlook is concerned, it's been business as usual and steady since really that first week in March. And our expectation, frankly, is that the impacts that were driving some pressure in the fourth quarter and the first two-thirds of the first quarter will continue to put pressure on deposits, probably to the tune of 1% to 2%.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And just my follow-up is just then what about that mix? And what -- how do you expect that mix of DDAs to total as there's more cycling of that? I think you're down to about 32% in the first quarter. What do you think -- you had previously said you thought you could approach that 30% over time. Has that view changed at all given what's happened?\nBill Rogers: Yeah. Ken, it's Bill. We're -- pre-COVID, we were sort of at 29%. As you mentioned, we're right 32% now. We're going to clearly migrate down to that high-20s. And sort of depending upon where rates are, I think that sort of is the stabilization level as based upon what we know right now. And just to add to what Mike said as well and continue to just focus on the positive side of the retail deposit production, I just expect that engine to continue. So while sort of on balance, we might be down flattish to down 1 or so percent, that includes a really good positive production momentum we have in our core franchise.\nKen Usdin: Understood. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Yeah.\nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBlake Netter: Hi. This is Blake Netter on the line for Betsy. Good morning.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nBlake Netter: I'm wondering, if you could \u2013 could talk about how you're thinking about the potential impact of tougher LCR requirements and TLAC (ph) [indiscernible] expected to be announced in the near future. How -- and how should we think about your debt issuance plans and other potential impact?\nMike Maguire: Sure. I'd say from a TLAC perspective, this is something that we've had our eyes on for a number of quarters that the entire industry has, certainly, companies our size. We've studied the framework. We've previously probably were considering tailored versions of TLAC, perhaps that will ultimately be the case. But in the abundance of caution, the framework that we've assessed is sort of a traditionally applied framework, the same that the largest banks in the country have applied. And from our perspective, our regular way issuance, certainly given some reasonable phase-in period will allow Truist to comply really without much effort. And so to your question around debt issuance, we -- you saw we raised $3 billion in January. Our expectation given Truist scale and funding needs and perspective is that we'll be a relatively regular issuer. And to the extent that we get a better sense for what's eligible and not eligible from a TLAC perspective, that may influence how we issue whether it's at the holding company or the opco. But I think the net of it is that we feel really well prepared and positioned to comply with TLAC to the extent that that's applied to Truist.\nBlake Netter: Got it. And separately, just one more question for me. Service charges on deposits came down a bit sequentially this quarter. Can you talk about the potential for overdrafts you used to get even [indiscernible] from here?\nBill Rogers: Yeah. They're going to continue to get lower like, we instituted our Truist One, which is sort of a big part of the deposit generation and new client acquisition, but it's also our no overdraft fee accounts. So those will continue to draft lower. And those are in all of our guidance and everything that we talked about. And they\u2019re basically right on path to where we thought they\u2019d be.\nBlake Netter: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nBill Rogers: Hi. Good morning.\nJohn Pancari: On the -- back to the deposit growth expectation, I just want to confirm that on 1% to 2%. Is that on end-of-period balances and debt for the full year, your expectation? Thanks.\nMike Maguire: Yeah. That's a quarterly view. And I'm not sure that's going to sort of be linear in its progression. If we think about just the impact of qualitative tightening and some of the work that we've done and certainly prior to this first quarter was just getting a sense for our share of the easing and how that may impact our share of the tightening. And so that 1% to 2% is reflective of QT continuing on a quarterly basis, and it's also reflective of, frankly, is the rate environment that we're in as people continue to assess bank alternative products where perhaps higher rates or investment products are or an alternative, but that's a quarterly view.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Got it, Mike. Thank you. And then separately, also on the margin and deposit dynamics. Can you maybe talk to us about how you can see this playing out in terms of the net interest margin project progression from here? And then also, what do you expect is a fair through cycle deposit beta. I know you're currently at 36%. And I want to get your thoughts there. Thanks.\nMike Maguire: Sure. Maybe just -- and we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our net interest margin in the first quarter, we were down on a reported basis, about 8 basis points, and that really had two primary drivers. The first was, we also mentioned that we have a little bit more liquidity on the balance sheet. That was something that we made the decision to do sort of in the abundance of caution. And so while that doesn't really have an impact on NII because there's very sort of de minimis negative carry relative to the funding cost there, it did swell the size of the balance sheet a bit. So the denominator impact drove about 2 basis points of net interest margin decline. And then we also had just the overall funding mix shift, which probably drove the bulk of the rest. There's also 1 basis point in there for PAA. Those same factors that drove our NIM down 8 basis points in the first quarter exist in the second quarter as well. Perhaps to -- and to some extent, in terms of the behaviors, maybe it will be a little bit more modest, but you also have to quarterize some of those impacts. And so our expectation is that NIM probably has downside of another, call it, dozen basis points in the second quarter. As far as the second half, probably have a more stable outlook for the NIM. There's -- we've mentioned before that we've sort of intentionally approached a more neutral kind of rate sensitivity position, but I think beyond that, it's really going to depend on some of these other factors. The betas, the mix that Bill just talked about on the DDA side, whether or not we see credit spreads widen as an example, is a factor two. The beta that we have in our assumption around NII and NIM, you mentioned we're at 36% today. That until now, we've been exceeding our expectations just as the first quarter where we performed a little worse than we expected, our spot data today on a IBD basis is 40%. We expect that to migrate to the low-40s for the full second quarter, and we have a terminal outlook of 44%.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I\u2019m not so faster, you are keep pushing the corvette analogy here, but it just looks like the fuel efficiency isn't quite as good. I don't know if you put diesel fuel in the corvette by mistake or what, but you closed 117 branches in the first quarter, so that should be good. You're getting other merger benefits. You've completed the integration phase and you guide for 5% to 7% revenue growth, which is decent, but also 5% to 7% expense growth. And isn't this the time when you go back to your management team and say, hey, we're getting more cautious on lending as you indicated. And we need to tighten some of this expense spend. And I get some of the expenses are FDIC and pension, minimum wage, but that's true at some of your peers, which are looking for positive operating leverage. I know you said positive operating leverage, but then you have 5% to 7% higher both for revenues and expenses. So just give a little bit more color about the efficiency of Truist as you transition from integration to growth. Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Right. And Mike, I'm going to spare from the corvette analogies is just try to sort of go right at it. As Mike said, I mean, we're really -- we're going to continue to focus on positive operating leverage. The revenue guidance is really an NII guidance issue. Our continued focus on insurance, investment banking, all the other things that comprise that, we're still very confident of. And hopefully, if markets really improve in the second half of the year, might even have some upside. But your point on the expense side is exactly right. I mean, we have call it, 4% or so, sort of embedded in the categories that you talked about. So the ability to manage in that other component of that. And trust me, every business leader has a positive operating leverage plan, and they are readjusting those plans based on particularly those that have an NII component to their plans and the things that they can do. You saw already this quarter, things that we're doing that are more reflective of the strategy you talked about the realignment of fixed income, consolidation of LightStream. I mean in the past, these might have been things that sort of would have been off the table. Now they're firmly on the table like everything else as it relates to expenses. We'll do more work in the mortgage area, all the things with spans and layers, real estate, digitization, automation, all that is firmly on the table and a clear focus for us as we move into the rest of this year with a keen focus and eye on positive operating leverage.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then one separate question. Do you plan to rebrand LightStream to Truist? And if so, does that mean you're going to have more of a national branding strategy. And it's interesting, you're in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic with Truist. You go outside the region with the different brands. So I'm just trying to reconcile your brand names.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. Really sort of same way around actually. So we really -- we're going to eventually wind down the LightStream brand and increase the Truist side of that. We created LightStream for completely different reasons that don't really exist today as it relates to Truist. So we've got this incredible franchise, incredible market, really good digital capabilities. And what we're doing now is say, let's bring all those digital capabilities, really fast turnaround times, incredible Net Promoter Scores with LightStream to all the Truist client base. So the emphasis will be on the Truist client base and then also with partnerships that are Truist clients rather than sort of this national brands. So I'm pleased with what we did. I think we did all the right things. We created this really cool capability. But to the comment I made earlier, we are also supporting a separate brand, and that has a lot of expense associated with it. There's a lot of marketing and other things with that. And we're having incredible success with the Truist brand. So we want to bring it under that umbrella, create some more efficiencies from an expense standpoint and then I think accelerate from a revenue standpoint and penetrating and further cementing these incredible deposit relationships we have.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. And your line is now\u2026\nBill Rogers: Ebrahim, are you on mute.\nAnkur Vyas: Allay, maybe we just shift to the next person.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: You mentioned that you \u2013 good morning. You're anticipating tighter capital and liquidity standards. And Bill, as you think about growing your capital from here, your starting point is 9.1. Do you feel like the build is now closer to 9.5 and 10 as you anticipate higher capital and liquidity standards. And if so, how should we think about your plans for dividend growth? I suspect that buybacks would be lowest priority? And also, is there some RWA mitigation that you could do in order to perhaps speed up that 20 basis points of organic capital generation.\nBill Rogers: Yeah, Erika. Thanks. Remember, we're actually at 9.4 today, as we've completed the interest and Truist Insurance Holdings. So if we start with there, I mean the mode we're in right now, I mean, we're comfortable where our capital level is. But we're in a capital build mode right now until we're not. So we want to really understand the landscape, understand the regulatory landscape, be prepared. We've got 20 basis points or so of sort of organic capital accretion that comes into play. That's post our dividend. Our dividend will continue to be important to us, and we'll continue to support our dividend. So I think we've got -- we're at a good place right now with capital. We'll continue to be in a little bit of the capital build mode. So we'll sort of blow through that 9.5 number you mentioned here in several quarters. And then we'll see. We'll just sort of see where the regulatory things line up and the opportunities that we have. And I think we've got the most organic combined with financial and strategic flexibility on capital to respond to sort of anything that might come our way. You did mention though, our focus is going to continue to be on supporting organic growth. We're going to maximize RWA, but we don't need to reduce RWA. So that we don't need to change RWA from a capital standpoint. But we do want to optimize it. We do want to create more velocity around RWA, which I talked about. Dividend being important and then M&A on particularly things like insurance and then capabilities to create sustainable advantages. And then as you mentioned, share repurchase is just not in our short-term window. I mean that's just not our focus right now.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my second question is, sorry to make this another car (ph) analogy, a 24% ROTCE is more like an F1 car rather than a Corvette right. But the conversation on your AFS portfolio that was brewing over the quarter aside, it feels like some of what's holding now in your valuation is the puts and takes the specials that keep coming up. And I wonder, Bill, where are you in terms of the optimization of this franchise because it's pretty clear that the steps that you have been taking and it seems like based on Mike's laundry list that you are accelerating has everything to do with the optimization of this franchise. And I wonder how you're weighing sort of pulling forward that optimization. And I mean, look, there's always a continuous improvement process for every company, right? But is it better to just clean everything up this year and perhaps for the sake of positive operating leverage to think about cleaner '24 and '25 numbers when it comes to the expenses. Because I do think that it's very clear what the potential of this franchise is, but there's always adjustments here and there. And so I feel like your investors are less likely to see that visibility on that expense curve bend that you guys are aiming for?\nBill Rogers: Yeah. Let me try to break that up into two components, if I understood the question. So the question is around the strategic parts of our business and optimizing those, you are seeing a little bit of an acceleration around there. That's not sort of a dramatic shift, but you're all seeing a speed up in that, and it's things around the edges. And I talked a little bit about those today. There are some more of those that we're thinking through. Because as you know, I mean, our core franchise is so powerful. And what we want to do is make sure that the resources that we have at this company are devoted towards growing, expanding that incredible franchise. So the things that we talked about, about capital markets and LightStream, I think, are really good examples of those. And you could argue they were probably a little accelerated maybe with a small A of accelerating. If you're going to the balance sheet side, are we going to do anything on the securities portfolio, the answer to that is not at this time. I mean there's just not a really good economic benefit for that, and we want to be long-term protectors of shareholder value. And so I think we'll stay the course there unless something were to change dramatically that would cause us to change our posture. Did that [indiscernible], Erika?\nErika Najarian: Yeah. I was just wondering if -- just a follow-up, it seems as if you have optimized and accelerated some of the initiatives and I'm wondering, if you can tell your investors that your goal for '24 is really sort of cleaner quarters on expenses so that they could really see that expense curve in terms of your GAAP EPS power?\nBill Rogers: Yeah. I think relative to the first part of that, yes, that would be the goal. And I think they\u2019re getting cleaner every quarter, and they\u2019re going to continue to stay on that flight path. But when we have opportunities that we think are long-term beneficial, we\u2019re not going to miss those. But I think your basic statement of we\u2019ll be \u2013 will we have a cleaner quarter process in \u201824, yes. And I think they get cleaner every quarter along that path.\nErika Najarian: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Mike, and maybe this is more directed to Clarke on credit. You guys had very strong credit quality, obviously. But you perked my interest with something that you said in the prepared remarks that charge-offs, again, they're low, went up by 3 basis points. But you cited C&I, which was interesting to me. So the question is, and then you also pointed out that the allowance, of course, was built up for CRE, but you talked about you're reducing your risk appetite in selected areas. So where are those areas, number one? And then in C&I, if you guys could elaborate what -- maybe what happened there in comments also about your leverage loan portfolio that I assume is included in the C&I as well.\nClarke Starnes: Great. Hey, Gerard.\nBill Rogers: Hey, Clarke. Why don't you start with [indiscernible] there.\nClarke Starnes: So as far as what areas are we focused on, first and foremost, what I'd say is that we want to maintain our through-the-cycle lending approach as we always have for our clients. So we're not going to make dramatic shifts in our appetite or how we lend. We just want to be more cautious and prudent where it makes sense. So things like less exceptions, more due diligence and some of the areas we're focused on right now would be the ones you would expect, higher leverage. So leverage finance would be one, things like senior care given the market aspects of CRE, lower-end consumer, things like that, Gerard. So I think it's more around being cautious, but being consistent there for our clients. And to your other question, our leverage book is performing very well right now. So I would just remind you all the portion that you would be focused on is about 3.6% of our total loans. Portfolio is 50% investment grade. We have very modest hold levels. Our leverage multiples have come down over the last couple of years in that book. And right now, it's performing very well. We have NPLs at 0.6%. Our NCOs are at 0.11%. So very good overall performance. And then as far as the C&I losses in Q1, there's nothing episodic there. We're coming off such extremely low levels. If we go back into 2022, we were in just a couple of basis point range, and we were up just more toward a normalized range. So nothing specific there.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you, Clarke. And then following up, Mike, you talked about the investment banking business, how you've built it out with some strategic hires over the last two years. And we know from the market conditions from some of your larger competitors, it's challenging out there. Are you guys comfortable with your revenue to expense area in investment banking now or do you really want to see or need the revenues to kind of really pick up as the market conditions pick up?\nMike Maguire: Yeah. I'll start there and maybe Bill may have something to add. But the investment banking business is performing well. It was a bright spot for us. In the first quarter, we have expectations that it will continue to perform well. Pipelines remain solid. And I think that a lot of that is driven by the fact that we've been adding really high caliber sort of franchise type talent to that platform, not just recently but consistently over the years. And so look, I mean, there's no doubt about it. There's market interruptions, transaction markets, deal markets are a little harder. But in sort of the middle market and upper middle market space, where we feel like we've really got a powerful franchise, we continue to get deals done for our clients on the corporate and sponsor side. And so we're still very supportive and optimistic about the investment banking business. And look, we're managing it carefully and revenues will be highly correlated with expenses in that business, but that's always been the case.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. And for us, to your margin question, investment banking business always been a good margin business and has had a lot of discipline over a long period of time. And part of that sustainability, I think you saw some of it this quarter is back to the earlier comments and questions were having about the strength of the franchise. So being able to take advantage of this incredible franchise and client base really afford us this opportunity all across high grade, debt and equity, earn revenue being up. So it just creates more consistency and more confidence for us in that revenue base.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you for the insights gentlemen.\nAnkur Vyas: Allay, we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: And we'll take our last question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn McDonald: Hi. Good morning. I know we're running tight. Maybe we could get a comments from John about the operating environment for insurance this year. And then also if you could add on your thoughts about utilizing the increased optionality that the transaction has gotten you and what the M&A environment looks like for you? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Hey, John. Do you want to\u2026\nJohn Howard: Sure, John. This is John Howard. Thank you very much for the question. When I look at the environment from an insurance standpoint, it continues to be favorable. Pricing continues to be firm, if you think about insured values and you think about insured rates, they are both affected by the inflationary environment that we're experiencing. Those are tailwinds for us. There are some capacity headwinds, particularly around catastrophe exposed property. But net-net, we'll continue to see good organic growth in insurance. And I do expect our organic growth to improve over the course of the year. And to your question about acquisitions, the market response to the Stone Point transaction has been very positive. So we've gotten great feedback from teammates, clients, insurance companies, business partners as well as acquisition candidates. So I think we're very well positioned.\nJohn McDonald: Great. Thanks.\nAnkur Vyas: Thanks, John. Okay. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We know you guys will have a busy day, but we hope you have a great day. Allay, you can now disconnect the call.\nOperator: And with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. I know you have a busy day ahead of you. The first quarter of 2023 was certainly an unusual and maybe even possibly an historic one for our banking industry. I am really extremely proud of our more than 50,000 teammates who leaned into our purpose and continue to care for our clients and stakeholders, reassuring them of Truist's position of strength and commitment to serve them. Throughout the quarter, we continue to experience the benefits of our shift from integrating to operating as evidenced by improved organic production and increasing client satisfaction scores which in our branches has send it to new highs from the weeks after March 9. Based on a volatile and uncertain environment, we successfully demonstrated the strength and resiliency of Truist's diverse business mix, scale and market share, granular and relationship-oriented deposit base and strong capital and liquidity. But as we will also discuss, some of that positive momentum was offset by some higher funding costs and somewhat elevated expenses. Strategically, we continue to take actions to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and at the same time, simplify, consolidate or exit certain activities to improve profitable growth. Mike will share some of those details later in the call. We'll provide more details on the quarter's results and other topical items throughout the presentation. But first, let's begin with our purpose on Slides 4 and 5. And in certain times, it can be easy to focus on the short-term at the expense of the long-term, which is why it's important that we always lead with purpose at Truist. These slides are a powerful reminder that the most effective way to grow over the long-term is to deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. But today, my comments will be on this topic a little briefer to gauge investor interest and other topics. Our purpose statement intentionally begins with the words Inspire. And that's exactly what I witnessed while working closely with our teammates in March. As I mentioned, I was inspired by how our teammates leaned into purpose and care as they held numerous discussions with clients and stakeholders to answer their questions about the banking system to emphasize Truist's financial position and strength and help them move forward with their financial needs. In addition to client care we provided last month, there were many other ways we actualized our purpose throughout the quarter, which we highlight on Slide 5. You can read more about these items and many of our other efforts to build better lives and communities in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, which we published last week. Now I'll walk through our first quarter performance highlights on Slide 7. Quarter performance slide focused mostly on GAAP or unadjusted results given that MOE-related spend (ph) exited our run rate last year. Going forward, we intend to focus primarily on GAAP results with the exceptions of adjusted tangible efficiency and adjusted PPNR since intangible amortization expense remained significant due to the scale of the MOE and has no impact on capital generation. Truist reported first quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $1.05 a share, up 6% like quarter due to strong growth in adjusted PPNR, lower merger cost, partially offset by a more normal provision level compared to a year ago. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, EPS decreased 13%, primarily due to lower net interest income and seasonality. Adjusted PPNR decreased 7% sequentially, consistent with our prior guidance as better than expected fee income due to higher capital markets activity was more than offset by lower net interest income and somewhat higher than expected expenses. Relative to the first quarter of 2022, adjusted PPNR grew 19%, and we delivered 310 basis points of positive adjusted operating leverage, reflecting a good start to the year. Asset quality remains strong and net charge-offs continue to normalize consistent with our expectations. We prudently built our ALLL ratio 3 basis points to reflect a more uncertain economic environment. Balance sheet trends despite all the noise in mid-March were fairly expected and more business as usual, and we'll cover more about loans, deposits, capital and liquidity later in the presentation. So moving to our digital and technology update on Slide 8. Continued investments in progress in digital will be even more critical due to the close relationship between digital engagement, primacy of relationships and deposits. The good news is Truist prioritized digital early in the merger, building the Truist digital experience organically and in the cloud, which allows us to fully-own the digital experience for our clients end-to-end. Our first quarter results reflect our continued investments agility and momentum. In the first quarter, we opened 146,000 deposit accounts digitally, exceeding our internal expectations. We saw a strong growth in digital transactions and Zelle, in particular, underscoring the importance of payments and money movement capabilities to our clients. More broadly, we had an incredibly productive technology quarter as we advance our strategy to reimagine our capability set. In the deposit space, we launched a new data driven deposit pricing engine, which provides personalized relationship based rates for clients during account opening and will allow us to be even more targeted with respect to rate paid. We also enhanced our digital lending capabilities with the launch of our commercial loan dashboard, an industry-leading solution that allows wholesale lending clients to track the status of their loans, upload documents and eventually electronically signed documents. Our goal is to eventually incorporate this dashboard into one view, our desired end-state integrated digital experience across payments, lending and capital markets creating a seamless experience for commercial and corporate clients and to our relationship with Truist. So turning to loans and leases on Slide 9. Loan growth was solid in portfolios targeted for growth and lower portfolios where we've intentionally pulled back. Average loan balances grew 1.7% sequentially while end-of-period balances increased a more modest 50 basis points. The slower growth on an end-of-period basis was intentional and expected and reflects our strategic decision in the second half of last year to reduce production in certain lower return portfolios, including indirect auto and correspondent mortgage while also increasing rates and spreads from ongoing production. C&I balances increased 3.6% on an average basis and 1.8% on an end-of-period basis due to continued growth across CIB and CCB, reflecting the benefits of our capabilities and our markets. Consumer loan balances decreased 60 basis points on average and were down 1% from December 31, reflecting ongoing runoff in student and partnership lending as well as lower indirect auto production. Strategically, we're focusing our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our balance sheet usage with more single product and indirect clients. We're also evaluating ways to increase the velocity of our balance sheet, increasing greater utilization of loan sales and securitization. This allows us to be more impactful and increase returns in businesses such as service finance. Next, I'll provide some perspective on overall deposit trends starting on Slide 10. Despite the unique events of mid-March, average deposit trends during the first quarter were generally consistent with our expectations. Average deposit balance decreased 1.2%, driven by quantitative tightening, inflation and movements to higher rate alternatives. Within the month of March, more deposit flows were concentrated in the period from March 11 to March 18 and have largely been business as usual since including through yesterday. Positive outflows during mid-March were primarily related to CIG and CCB clients. We chose to diversify in the money market mutual funds and in some cases, across multiple bags. These outflows tended to be a higher cost of non-operational deposits. We also experienced deposit inflows as we're both attracting new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients. Retail production continues to improve due to our shift from integrating to operating and leading with the value proposition of Truist One. In the first quarter, Truist saw record new deposit production, including 18% year-over-year uplift in branch account openings with improved client retention driving strong net new account performance. Commercial Community Banking had record new account growth in March, and we've seen good momentum in the first couple of weeks of April as clients are beginning to move money to fund those accounts. More noteworthy than overall deposit flows was the pace of the mix shift from DDA as non-interest-bearing deposits decreased to 32% of deposits from 34% previously. This happened a little sooner than we previously anticipated. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 64 basis points sequentially, contributing to a cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta of 36% so far in the cycle. Deposit betas accelerated relative to the fourth quarter due to the presence of high rate alternatives and the previously mentioned shift from non-interest-bearing DDA into interest-bearing products. We'll continue to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing the value outside of rate paid. Given higher investor interest and additional deposit details, we provided a closer look at our deposit base on Slide 11. Truist has one of the most robust deposit franchises in the banking industry, thanks to three key factors. First, Truist has strong market shares in many of the fastest-growing markets in the U.S. Truist currently ranks first, second or third in deposit share in 17 of the Top 20 markets. Those include cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, D.C., Miami, Tampa, Raleigh-Durham, among others, making us the dominant player in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Second, Truist has a granular retail leading deposit base that is 63% insured and/or collateralized, which is the second highest in our peer group and an important source of stability. In addition, our commercial deposits are diversified across 21 industry groups with no one sector representing more than 10% of corporate and commercial banking deposits. Third, we're highly relationship oriented, as you can see from the table at the bottom of the slide. The average deposit account at Truist has been open for 17 years during which time these relationships have broadened to include multiple products and services. In retail and small business banking, we have over 12 million deposit accounts with an average account balance of 17,000. RSBB deposits are highly granular and 86% of balances are insured. In addition, Truist is the primary bank for the preponderance of those clients. In our Wealth business, 90% of the depositors have investments with Truist Wealth and our Commercial Community Bank 81% depositors have a payments lending or advisory relationship with Truist, with the majority of that related to operating treasury management products. Together, these factors are a source of strength for Truist and for our clients. So now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail. Great. Thanks, Mike. So to conclude on Slide 19, Truist is on the right path. And I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to produce strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. As we began to shift from integrating to operating several quarters ago, we also made a strategic decision to focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and are most synergistic with our core strengths. Since that time, we focus on product solutions and distinctive experiences that are most relevant to our primary consumer and deposit households into our commercial, corporate and high net worth clients while reducing our investment in businesses and clients that are less strategically relevant with respect to returns and relationship opportunities. We believe these changes are consistent with where the banking industry is likely to go from here. We're already realizing the early benefits of this shift. For instance, first quarter net new consumer checking account production was among the best we've seen since becoming Truist, driven by our continued focus on core deposit clients, the attractiveness of new products, including Truist One and improve retention as well as flight to quality. Branch checking account production has increased 13% since the launch of Trust One, and as I said earlier, has accelerated up to 18% compared to a year ago in the first quarter. The steady improvement we've seen in client satisfaction has been driven by the distinct service our branch and care agents provide as well as improvements in our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client journey rooms. As I indicated earlier, I'm really proud to care of our teammates -- care our teammates provided to our clients in March, and this is reflected in higher voice of client scores during the last few weeks of the quarter. Lastly, we continue to advance our integrated relationship management program by establishing long-term growth targets for our most strategic IRM partnerships, details of which I shared in December. Relative to the first quarter of last year, these strategic partnerships have grown revenues by 35%. At the same time, we acknowledge that the environment is tougher and strong balance sheet and expense management will remain critical for our stakeholders. In closing, while uncertainty has increased, Truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix, dynamic markets, conservative credit (ph) culture, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, strong profitability profile and our strong risk-adjusted capital position. I am truly optimistic about the future of Truist as our more than 50,000 talented teammates build on our momentum to create distinctive client experiences and deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. So with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. Yeah. Ken, it's Bill. We're -- pre-COVID, we were sort of at 29%. As you mentioned, we're right 32% now. We're going to clearly migrate down to that high-20s. And sort of depending upon where rates are, I think that sort of is the stabilization level as based upon what we know right now. And just to add to what Mike said as well and continue to just focus on the positive side of the retail deposit production, I just expect that engine to continue. So while sort of on balance, we might be down flattish to down 1 or so percent, that includes a really good positive production momentum we have in our core franchise. Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. They're going to continue to get lower like, we instituted our Truist One, which is sort of a big part of the deposit generation and new client acquisition, but it's also our no overdraft fee accounts. So those will continue to draft lower. And those are in all of our guidance and everything that we talked about. And they're basically right on path to where we thought they'd be. Hi. Good morning. Right. And Mike, I'm going to spare from the corvette analogies is just try to sort of go right at it. As Mike said, I mean, we're really -- we're going to continue to focus on positive operating leverage. The revenue guidance is really an NII guidance issue. Our continued focus on insurance, investment banking, all the other things that comprise that, we're still very confident of. And hopefully, if markets really improve in the second half of the year, might even have some upside. But your point on the expense side is exactly right. I mean, we have call it, 4% or so, sort of embedded in the categories that you talked about. So the ability to manage in that other component of that. And trust me, every business leader has a positive operating leverage plan, and they are readjusting those plans based on particularly those that have an NII component to their plans and the things that they can do. You saw already this quarter, things that we're doing that are more reflective of the strategy you talked about the realignment of fixed income, consolidation of LightStream. I mean in the past, these might have been things that sort of would have been off the table. Now they're firmly on the table like everything else as it relates to expenses. We'll do more work in the mortgage area, all the things with spans and layers, real estate, digitization, automation, all that is firmly on the table and a clear focus for us as we move into the rest of this year with a keen focus and eye on positive operating leverage. Yeah. Really sort of same way around actually. So we really -- we're going to eventually wind down the LightStream brand and increase the Truist side of that. We created LightStream for completely different reasons that don't really exist today as it relates to Truist. So we've got this incredible franchise, incredible market, really good digital capabilities. And what we're doing now is say, let's bring all those digital capabilities, really fast turnaround times, incredible Net Promoter Scores with LightStream to all the Truist client base. So the emphasis will be on the Truist client base and then also with partnerships that are Truist clients rather than sort of this national brands. So I'm pleased with what we did. I think we did all the right things. We created this really cool capability. But to the comment I made earlier, we are also supporting a separate brand, and that has a lot of expense associated with it. There's a lot of marketing and other things with that. And we're having incredible success with the Truist brand. So we want to bring it under that umbrella, create some more efficiencies from an expense standpoint and then I think accelerate from a revenue standpoint and penetrating and further cementing these incredible deposit relationships we have. Thanks. Ebrahim, are you on mute. Good morning. Yeah, Erika. Thanks. Remember, we're actually at 9.4 today, as we've completed the interest and Truist Insurance Holdings. So if we start with there, I mean the mode we're in right now, I mean, we're comfortable where our capital level is. But we're in a capital build mode right now until we're not. So we want to really understand the landscape, understand the regulatory landscape, be prepared. We've got 20 basis points or so of sort of organic capital accretion that comes into play. That's post our dividend. Our dividend will continue to be important to us, and we'll continue to support our dividend. So I think we've got -- we're at a good place right now with capital. We'll continue to be in a little bit of the capital build mode. So we'll sort of blow through that 9.5 number you mentioned here in several quarters. And then we'll see. We'll just sort of see where the regulatory things line up and the opportunities that we have. And I think we've got the most organic combined with financial and strategic flexibility on capital to respond to sort of anything that might come our way. You did mention though, our focus is going to continue to be on supporting organic growth. We're going to maximize RWA, but we don't need to reduce RWA. So that we don't need to change RWA from a capital standpoint. But we do want to optimize it. We do want to create more velocity around RWA, which I talked about. Dividend being important and then M&A on particularly things like insurance and then capabilities to create sustainable advantages. And then as you mentioned, share repurchase is just not in our short-term window. I mean that's just not our focus right now. Yeah. Let me try to break that up into two components, if I understood the question. So the question is around the strategic parts of our business and optimizing those, you are seeing a little bit of an acceleration around there. That's not sort of a dramatic shift, but you're all seeing a speed up in that, and it's things around the edges. And I talked a little bit about those today. There are some more of those that we're thinking through. Because as you know, I mean, our core franchise is so powerful. And what we want to do is make sure that the resources that we have at this company are devoted towards growing, expanding that incredible franchise. So the things that we talked about, about capital markets and LightStream, I think, are really good examples of those. And you could argue they were probably a little accelerated maybe with a small A of accelerating. If you're going to the balance sheet side, are we going to do anything on the securities portfolio, the answer to that is not at this time. I mean there's just not a really good economic benefit for that, and we want to be long-term protectors of shareholder value. And so I think we'll stay the course there unless something were to change dramatically that would cause us to change our posture. Did that [indiscernible], Erika? Yeah. I think relative to the first part of that, yes, that would be the goal. And I think they're getting cleaner every quarter, and they're going to continue to stay on that flight path. But when we have opportunities that we think are long-term beneficial, we're not going to miss those. But I think your basic statement of we'll be \u2013 will we have a cleaner quarter process in \u201824, yes. And I think they get cleaner every quarter along that path. Good morning. Hey, Clarke. Why don't you start with [indiscernible] there. Yeah. And for us, to your margin question, investment banking business always been a good margin business and has had a lot of discipline over a long period of time. And part of that sustainability, I think you saw some of it this quarter is back to the earlier comments and questions were having about the strength of the franchise. So being able to take advantage of this incredible franchise and client base really afford us this opportunity all across high grade, debt and equity, earn revenue being up. So it just creates more consistency and more confidence for us in that revenue base. Hey, John. Do you want to..."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mike Maguire",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with net interest income on Slide 12. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 2.8% sequentially as higher funding costs and two fewer days in the quarter more than offset the effects of solid loan growth. Reported net interest margin decreased 8 basis points, while core net interest margin decreased 7 basis points. When you break down the decrease in the core net interest margin, approximately 5 basis points was driven by a shift in the funding mix from DDA and other low cost deposit products into interest-bearing deposits and about 2 basis points was due to our decision to conservatively carry more liquidity during the last few weeks of March. Moving to fee income on Slide 13. Fee income was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter and modestly exceeded our expectations in light of typical seasonal headwinds. Insurance income increased $47 million, largely due to seasonality. Year-over-year organic revenue growth was 4.7%. Mortgage banking income rose $25 million, primarily due to a gain on sale of a servicing portfolio, which was partially offset by MSR valuation adjustments. Income from core mortgage activity was relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. Wealth management income improved $15 million, benefiting from an increase in brokerage commissions, asset flows and higher fees due to rising asset prices during the quarter. Wealth continues to build momentum as net organic asset flows, which exclude the impact of market value changes, were approximately $1 billion for the quarter and have been positive for seven of the last eight quarters. In addition, we were pleased by the modest increase in investment banking and trading income, led by strength in investment grade and high yield bond originations, fixed income derivatives and loan syndications. CIB's performance continues to be aided by two idiosyncratic factors, strategic hiring over the past two years as well as increased integrated relationship management activity. With respect to IRM, capital markets fees from non-CIB clients increased 12% sequentially and were 20% up from first quarter 2022. Other income decreased $56 million, primarily due to lower income from our non-qualified plan. While fee income remains below its potential, our investments in key areas such as insurance, investment banking and wealth will continue to be a source of momentum as markets normalize and as our IRM execution continues to mature. Turning now to Slide 14. Reported non-interest expense declined $31 million driven by a $107 million reduction in merger costs due to the completion of integration activities and a $27 million decrease in amortization expense. The expense reductions I just described were largely offset by $103 million or a 3% increase in adjusted non-interest expense. Expense drivers included a $39 million increase in pension expense and a $23 million increase in regulatory charges due to higher FDIC premiums. We also experienced a $33 million increase in operating losses, which are reflected in other expense due to industry check fraud issues and then operating loss within Truist Insurance recognized prior to completing our transaction with Stone Point. As a company, we are committed to generating expense reductions and have undertaken a number of actions that help bend the expense arc at Truist. Last week, we announced a strategic realignment within our fixed income sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain market-making activities and services provided by our middle markets fixed income platform. This platform was largely focused on MBS-related sales and trading for depositories and had produced an unattractive ROE. This realignment will result in an approximate $50 million run rate expense save with little PPNR impact and enable us to focus more on our core strategy of being a fulsome and premier investment bank for corporates, sponsors and municipal issuers. We're also in the process of realigning our LightStream platforms with our broader consumer business with the goal of bringing the innovation, digital capabilities, efficiencies and cloud-based infrastructure of LightStream to Truist's broader client base. This will reduce the cost of supporting a separate brand and strategy and enhance the experience and primacy with our existing and prospective clients. In addition, we continue to adjust our capacity and focus in mortgage to reflect current challenging market conditions and our own strategic focus on client primacy. These actions, among others, are what drove the $63 million of restructuring charges during the quarter. Furthermore, we've also aligned executive compensation to Truist to shareholder expectations, which I shared with many of you about a month ago. Taken together, we believe these as well as other actions we're taking will increase our focus, bend our expense curve and improve returns for Truist. Moving to Slide 15. Asset quality remained strong in the first quarter, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio. Leading indicators remain favorable. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 15 basis points sequentially and were down 17 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Our NPL ratio was steady at a relatively benign 36 basis points. Net charge-offs increased 3 basis points to 37 basis points, primarily due to C&I and continued normalization in the consumer and are consistent with pre-pandemic levels. We became even more cautious in our outlook regarding CRE fundamentals. And in light of increased economic uncertainty, we prudently increased our allowance by $102 million and increased our ALLL ratio by 3 basis points to 1.37%. In anticipation of an increasing risk environment, we are also tightening credit and reducing our risk appetite in selected areas while maintaining our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality, long-term clients. Next, given high investor interest, I will dive deeper into CRE on Slide 16. As we began the integration process to become Truist, we were very intentional about retaining the diversification benefits of the merger. To achieve this outcome, we carefully evaluated our various portfolios, including CRE to ensure we fully understood their combined risk profile and to establish how we would manage them going forward. While we did not wholly pause CRE production during this process, we did deemphasize it until we aligned on a single go-to-market strategy. As a result of this decision, Truist CRE portfolio actually decreased by 2.2% from the end of 2019 to the end of 2022, whereas our median peer grew CRE 21%. Our disciplined focus on diversification has also resulted in less CRE concentration and risk relative to our peer group. At year-end, CRE represented 11% of our loan mix compared to 12% at our median peer and the office segment comprised 1.6% of our loan book versus 1.9% at our median peer. We maintain a high-quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. We typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through the cycle. Our exposure tends to be large CRE with strong institutional sponsorship, and we have reduced our exposure to smaller CRE. The quality of our CRE portfolio is also reflected in the Federal Reserve's annual stress test results. Our disciplined approach to CRE is reflected in our asset quality metrics, which remain solid. In the lower right, you can see a snapshot of our office portfolio, which had approximately $5 billion in outstanding balances as of March 31 and another area where Truist has been risk averse and highly selective over the past two years. Our office portfolio tends to be weighted towards Class A properties within our footprint, which we believe will perform better than large urban markets. We have a great CRE team that is very proactive in working with clients to get ahead of any problems. Criticized trends have increased over the past few months, but we believe overall problems will be manageable given our conservative LTVs, our reserves and the laddered maturity profile of the portfolio. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 17. Our CET1 ratio increased from 9% to 9.1% as approximately 20 basis points of organic capital generation was partially offset by 12 basis points of CECL phase-in. While not included in our CET1 ratio, AOCI improved by $1 billion from December 31 to March 31. Of our $12.6 billion of after-tax OCI, as of March 31, $8.5 billion is related to our AFS portfolio, $2.5 billion is related to the frozen portion of the HTM portfolio, and $1.5 billion is related to our pension plan. We would expect the securities portfolio related OCI to decrease by $2 billion to $2.5 billion by the end of 2024 or by approximately 20%, and that's in a static rate environment. In addition, this accretion will be a powerful driver of higher tangible book value per share over time, a small glimpse of which we saw this past quarter with tangible book value increasing 8%. On April 3, we also closed on the sale of a 20% minority stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which added approximately 30 basis points to our capital ratios and provides flexibility in the future. Additionally, we declared a strong common dividend of $0.52 per share, which was paid on March 1. Finally, Truist continues to have significant access to liquidity and a very robust liquidity managed process that includes internal and external stress testing as well as real-time monitoring of our liquidity position. Our average consolidated LCR improved to 113% during the first quarter and remains well above the regulatory minimum of 100%. We have access to approximately $166 billion of liquidity, including cash, FHLB borrowing capacity, unpledged securities and discount window capacity. As a reminder, government and agency obligations represent 97% of our securities portfolio, which produces about $2.5 billion to $3 billion of cash flow per quarter. During the quarter, we conservatively increased our cash position from $16 billion as of December 31 to $33 billion at the end of March, funded largely by callable FHLB advances and would expect that to somewhat normalize going forward given that activity has stabilized. More broadly, we do expect regulatory requirements around capital and liquidity to heighten, but believe we're in a strong position to respond given the already high expectations for an institution of our size, the strategic and financial flexibility we have as a company in the orderly phase-in period that would likely accompany potential changes. Now I will review our updated guidance on Slide 18. Looking into the second quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be relatively stable compared to the first quarter as a modest decline in NII is offset by seasonally stronger insurance revenue. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 1% to 2% linked quarter primarily as a result of higher incentive-based compensation from insurance revenue growth. For the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 5% to 7% compared to 2022. The decline from our previous outlook is driven almost entirely by a lower net interest income outlook given higher deposit and funding costs. Adjusted expenses are still expected to increase between 5% and 7%. As I indicated earlier, we remain focused on taking actions throughout the year to reduce costs. Excluded from our adjusted expense outlook are two items. First, we are not including the impact of any potential incremental FDIC surcharge or assessment. After we receive clarity, we'll provide an update on estimated impact. Secondly, there will be some one-time costs occurring in 2023 and 2024 tied to preparing Truist Insurance Holdings to transition its operating model to be more independent, which is consistent with its new capital structure. These expenses directly correlate to realizing significant value in the business over time. We will not adjust for these expenses in our results, but we will provide transparency. Our goal is still to produce positive operating leverage and positive adjusted PPNR growth for the full year, excluding these two items. The degree of difficulty has increased relative to January given higher funding costs. Our expectations for the net charge-off ratio to be between 35 basis points for the full year is unchanged. Lastly, excluding discrete items, we now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20%, which translates to approximately 22% on a taxable equivalent basis due to our adoption of recent accounting guidance regarding the amortization of new market tax credits. This change simply shifts contra revenue and other income to the tax expense line and has no impact on the bottom line. Now I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Hey. Good morning, Ken. It's Mike. That's right. We saw really throughout the course of the quarter, relatively stable flows. Actually, if you think about sort of where we saw our balances evolve throughout the first-two months of the quarter, very typical. We saw some seasonal outflows related to public funds. We saw the expected impact of qualitative tightening, which we've seen throughout the previous couple of quarters. And so we're probably down about 1% or so. And then in the last month of the quarter, we really saw continued public fund outflows. We saw a little bit of higher rate pursuant behavior. We saw people cycling into money market accounts to a higher extent. We saw some of our wealth clients cycle into investment accounts and ended down about 2% for the quarter. I'd say the bulk of the money [indiscernible] happened during that week that Bill mentioned in our opening remarks. As far as outlook is concerned, it's been business as usual and steady since really that first week in March. And our expectation, frankly, is that the impacts that were driving some pressure in the fourth quarter and the first two-thirds of the first quarter will continue to put pressure on deposits, probably to the tune of 1% to 2%. Sure. I'd say from a TLAC perspective, this is something that we've had our eyes on for a number of quarters that the entire industry has, certainly, companies our size. We've studied the framework. We've previously probably were considering tailored versions of TLAC, perhaps that will ultimately be the case. But in the abundance of caution, the framework that we've assessed is sort of a traditionally applied framework, the same that the largest banks in the country have applied. And from our perspective, our regular way issuance, certainly given some reasonable phase-in period will allow Truist to comply really without much effort. And so to your question around debt issuance, we -- you saw we raised $3 billion in January. Our expectation given Truist scale and funding needs and perspective is that we'll be a relatively regular issuer. And to the extent that we get a better sense for what's eligible and not eligible from a TLAC perspective, that may influence how we issue whether it's at the holding company or the opco. But I think the net of it is that we feel really well prepared and positioned to comply with TLAC to the extent that that's applied to Truist. Yeah. That's a quarterly view. And I'm not sure that's going to sort of be linear in its progression. If we think about just the impact of qualitative tightening and some of the work that we've done and certainly prior to this first quarter was just getting a sense for our share of the easing and how that may impact our share of the tightening. And so that 1% to 2% is reflective of QT continuing on a quarterly basis, and it's also reflective of, frankly, is the rate environment that we're in as people continue to assess bank alternative products where perhaps higher rates or investment products are or an alternative, but that's a quarterly view. Sure. Maybe just -- and we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our net interest margin in the first quarter, we were down on a reported basis, about 8 basis points, and that really had two primary drivers. The first was, we also mentioned that we have a little bit more liquidity on the balance sheet. That was something that we made the decision to do sort of in the abundance of caution. And so while that doesn't really have an impact on NII because there's very sort of de minimis negative carry relative to the funding cost there, it did swell the size of the balance sheet a bit. So the denominator impact drove about 2 basis points of net interest margin decline. And then we also had just the overall funding mix shift, which probably drove the bulk of the rest. There's also 1 basis point in there for PAA. Those same factors that drove our NIM down 8 basis points in the first quarter exist in the second quarter as well. Perhaps to -- and to some extent, in terms of the behaviors, maybe it will be a little bit more modest, but you also have to quarterize some of those impacts. And so our expectation is that NIM probably has downside of another, call it, dozen basis points in the second quarter. As far as the second half, probably have a more stable outlook for the NIM. There's -- we've mentioned before that we've sort of intentionally approached a more neutral kind of rate sensitivity position, but I think beyond that, it's really going to depend on some of these other factors. The betas, the mix that Bill just talked about on the DDA side, whether or not we see credit spreads widen as an example, is a factor two. The beta that we have in our assumption around NII and NIM, you mentioned we're at 36% today. That until now, we've been exceeding our expectations just as the first quarter where we performed a little worse than we expected, our spot data today on a IBD basis is 40%. We expect that to migrate to the low-40s for the full second quarter, and we have a terminal outlook of 44%. Yeah. I'll start there and maybe Bill may have something to add. But the investment banking business is performing well. It was a bright spot for us. In the first quarter, we have expectations that it will continue to perform well. Pipelines remain solid. And I think that a lot of that is driven by the fact that we've been adding really high caliber sort of franchise type talent to that platform, not just recently but consistently over the years. And so look, I mean, there's no doubt about it. There's market interruptions, transaction markets, deal markets are a little harder. But in sort of the middle market and upper middle market space, where we feel like we've really got a powerful franchise, we continue to get deals done for our clients on the corporate and sponsor side. And so we're still very supportive and optimistic about the investment banking business. And look, we're managing it carefully and revenues will be highly correlated with expenses in that business, but that's always been the case."

Pricing continues to be firm, if you think about insured values and you think about insured rates, they are both affected by the inflationary environment that we're experiencing. Those are tailwinds for us. There are some capacity headwinds, particularly around catastrophe exposed property. But net-net, we'll continue to see good organic growth in insurance. And I do expect our organic growth to improve over the course of the year. And to your question about acquisitions, the market response to the Stone Point transaction has been very positive. So we've gotten great feedback from teammates, clients, insurance companies, business partners as well as acquisition candidates. So I think we're very well positioned."

            "name": "Clarke Starnes",
            "content": "Great. Hey, Gerard. So as far as what areas are we focused on, first and foremost, what I'd say is that we want to maintain our through-the-cycle lending approach as we always have for our clients. So we're not going to make dramatic shifts in our appetite or how we lend. We just want to be more cautious and prudent where it makes sense. So things like less exceptions, more due diligence and some of the areas we're focused on right now would be the ones you would expect, higher leverage. So leverage finance would be one, things like senior care given the market aspects of CRE, lower-end consumer, things like that, Gerard. So I think it's more around being cautious, but being consistent there for our clients. And to your other question, our leverage book is performing very well right now. So I would just remind you all the portion that you would be focused on is about 3.6% of our total loans. Portfolio is 50% investment grade. We have very modest hold levels. Our leverage multiples have come down over the last couple of years in that book. And right now, it's performing very well. We have NPLs at 0.6%. Our NCOs are at 0.11%. So very good overall performance. And then as far as the C&I losses in Q1, there's nothing episodic there. We're coming off such extremely low levels. If we go back into 2022, we were in just a couple of basis point range, and we were up just more toward a normalized range. So nothing specific there."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire; our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer, Clarke Starnes; as well as other members of Truist's senior management team. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2024. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist investor relations website at ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I will turn it over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Before we discuss the third quarter's results, I'd like to begin with purpose on Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company. We're dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. It's the foundation for everything we do and the belief in this mission has never been more important given the extraordinary start to the fourth quarter with two devastating hurricanes. In the days since these storms cut a path through the Southeast, Truist's humanitarian aid team and hundreds of teammate volunteers have been out and forced to help our communities. I spent time in recent days with teammates in some of the hardest hit areas. These teammates are doing just incredible heroic work, helping their neighbors, distributing critical supplies and making sure Truist facilities were open to serve our clients even as their own lives have been upended. In addition to contributions from the foundation, we've set up several sites where we've distributed supplies. We've also deployed mobile services for basic needs like showers and laundering facilities as well as mobile branches, ATMs and generators to serve clients in areas without power. This recovery is going to take time, and we're going to play a significant role in helping these communities recover and rebuild in the days, weeks, months and even years to come. They can count on Truist. Okay. Let's turn to discussing our third quarter results on Slide 5. We've made demonstrable progress on our strategic priorities during the quarter, as I'm proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum and sound asset quality metrics. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $0.99 a share, adjusted EPS was $0.97 per share, which excluded a few small discrete items that Mike will discuss later in the call. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we grew adjusted revenue 2.4% on a linked-quarter basis due to another strong quarter of investment banking and trading income and a full quarter's impact on the balance sheet repositioning we completed during the second quarter. Second, our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost. As a result of these efforts, our efficiency ratio improved on both a linked and like-quarter basis. Adjusted expenses increased by less than 1% linked-quarter and declined for the third consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. Expenses are now projected to decline sin 2024 compared to 2023, which is an improvement from our original commitment to keep expenses flat for the year. Non-performing loans remained relatively stable while net charge-offs were better than our expectations. We did record a $25 million loan loss provision during the quarter specifically related to Hurricane Helene, which Mike will discuss in more detail later. We also returned $1.2 billion worth of capital to our shareholders through our common dividend and repurchase of $500 million worth of common stock as part of the $5 billion repurchase plan our Board approved in late July -- I mean, late June, excuse me. We anticipate repurchasing another $500 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. Our CET1 capital ratio remained relatively stable, leaving us well-positioned to grow our balance sheet and to continue to return significant amount of capital to shareholders. Finally, we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core consumer and small business and wholesale banking businesses. Although average loans declined during the quarter, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased loan production, greater wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company, all while continuing to maintain our expense discipline and investing in important areas like technology and our risk infrastructure. Maintaining this momentum and continuing to execute against our strategic growth priorities will be key to reaching our mid-teens medium-term ROATCE target, which we also announced during the quarter. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the quarterly results, I want to spend a little time reviewing the positive momentum we're seeing within business segments and within our digital initiatives on Slides 6 and 7. In Consumer and Small Business Banking, I'm encouraged by the momentum as we experienced an increase in loan production in key focus areas within our lending portfolio, and we continue to acquire new clients and households through both digital and traditional channels. Average consumer loan balance remained relatively stable linked-quarter as growth in other consumer, which includes our specialty consumer lending verticals, was offset by lower residential mortgage and home equity loans. We did experience a 3% linked-quarter increase in consumer loan production driven by non-real estate lending, which drove period-end indirect auto and other consumer balances, each higher by 2% on a linked-quarter basis. Importantly, we're not sacrificing our credit standards or pricing discipline to drive growth. Credit metrics remain relatively stable and new consumer loan production spreads are accretive to the portfolio. Although overall deposit growth remains muted, we're continuing to add new clients and households. We opened nearly 200,000 new digital loan and deposit accounts during the quarter, including over 75,000 new-to-bank clients through our digital channels, which represents a 35% increase over the third quarter of last year. Net new checking account growth was once again positive in the third quarter as we grew 40,000 new consumer and business accounts, bringing our total to 108,000 year-to-date. Not only are we adding new households, but primacy rates and client retention also continue to increase due to improvements to the client experience as we rolled out more than 130 enhancements to our digital experience during the quarter. In wholesale, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of improved production, increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company. During the quarter, we saw a 1% growth in commercial deposits and a 4% increase in wholesale lending production, which was offset by lower line utilization and higher paydowns due in part to greater capital markets activity, which is an area where we have invested consistently. The third quarter represents the strongest capital markets quarter we've reported since 2021 as investment banking revenues increased 79% year-over-year and 43% year-to-date. We experienced record quarterly performance in equity capital markets, investment-grade issuance, public finance and asset securitization. The growth is tied to our focus on gaining greater mindshare with our clients across our industry verticals, which has led to an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines. We're continuing to invest in our wholesale platform as we've made several key new hires this quarter in commercial banking, corporate banking, investment banking, wealth and payments and plan to add additional talent in the fourth quarter and beyond. These new teammates complement our great existing teams and have significant experience in many cases from larger institutions and are attracted to our results-oriented culture. As I mentioned last quarter, we have a specific focus on further building out our middle-market commercial lending segment, which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional businesses. We'll primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise where we've gained significant share. We also continue to enhance our wholesale digital capabilities by improving the client experience. During the quarter, we launched several significant enhancements to the Truist One View platform, including the ability for clients to securely chat directly with treasury management specialists. Enhancing the client experience and growing our digital capabilities are important parts of our strategy, which I'll discuss in more detail on Slide 7. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew 6% and digital transactions increased 15% compared to the third quarter of 2023. We continue to migrate clients towards self-service capabilities, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions, which are up 36% year-over-year. In addition to an increase in account openings, we're also seeing an improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up significantly over the third quarter of last year. Our recently enhanced digital deposit application experience has helped drive a 49% increase in mobile device applications, which now account for 72% of total digital applications. These improvements also drove a 500 basis point linked-quarter increase in the conversion rate on new digital applications, driving productivity and leading strong digital client satisfaction scores. We're not only better serving and growing with our clients, but we're also doing that more efficiently. So, now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results and I'll come back after that and close us out.\nMike Maguire: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As a high-level summary, we reported third quarter 2024 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $0.99 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $0.97 per share, which included a $36 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after-tax increase to the gain on sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and a $16 million pretax or another $0.01 per share after-tax reduction on the FDIC special assessment. Total revenue adjusted for the losses on the available-for-sale investment securities that were sold in the second quarter increased by 2.4% linked quarter due to a 2.2% increase in net interest income and 3.1% growth in non-interest income driven primarily by growth in investment banking and trading revenue. Adjusted expenses increased 0.9% linked-quarter but were down approximately 2.3% on a like-quarter basis, reflecting lower personnel costs. Moving on to capital. Our CET1 ratio remained relatively stable linked-quarter at 11.6% as current period earnings and a smaller balance sheet were offset by the payment of our common dividend and share repurchases completed during the quarter. From a credit perspective, net charge-offs declined by 3 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and our non-performing loans remained relatively stable both on a like and linked-quarter basis. Next, getting into additional detail, I'll cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans decreased $3 billion or 1% on a sequential basis, reflecting overall weaker commercial client demand and line utilization, partially offset by modest growth in consumer loans. Average commercial loans decreased by $3.2 billion or 1.7%, primarily due to a decline in C&I balances driven again by lower line utilization and at least in part by greater capital markets activity. In our consumer portfolio, average loans remained relatively stable linked-quarter as growth in indirect auto and service finance was offset with lower residential mortgage loans. As Bill mentioned, production improved in both consumer and wholesale lending, but paydowns and runoff in certain categories like commercial and residential real estate will likely result in continued pressure on an average balance basis in the fourth quarter, likely similar to the rate of decline that we experienced in the third quarter. Moving to deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1% sequentially or $3.7 billion with approximately $1.7 billion of the decline due to lower brokered deposits. Average non-interest bearing deposits decreased 1.4% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged versus the second quarter of 2024. The $1.7 billion decline in average brokered deposits reduced our total and interest-bearing deposit costs by 1 basis point sequentially to 2.08% and 2.88%, respectively. Overall, we expect deposit balances to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 12. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 2.2% linked-quarter or $77 million, primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning we completed during the second quarter, a reduction in higher-cost wholesale funding and the impact of one additional day in the third quarter. These tailwinds were partially offset by the impact of additional received fixed interest-rate swaps that became effective during the quarter and by lower commercial loan balances. Reported net interest margin increased 10 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.12% due primarily to the securities repositioning I just mentioned and a reduction in higher cost wholesale funding. Returning to non-interest income on Slide 12. Adjusted non-interest income increased $45 million or 3.1% relative to the second quarter. The linked-quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher other income and higher investment banking and trading income, which improved $46 million due to higher M&A, equity capital markets and investment-grade fees. Adjusted non-interest income increased 11% on a like-quarter basis due to higher investment banking and trading income and higher service charge on deposit income. Next, I'll cover non-interest expense on Slide 13. GAAP expenses of $2.9 billion decreased $167 million linked-quarter, primarily due to lower other expenses as the second quarter included a $150 million charitable donation. Regulatory costs decreased by $34 million, partially due to a $16 million reduction on the FDIC special assessment, which was recognized in 3Q24. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 0.9% sequentially due to higher professional fees, other, and marketing expense, partially offset by lower personnel expense. On a like-quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined by $67 million or 2.3%, reflecting lower personnel and other expenses. Now, moving to asset quality on Slide 14. Asset quality remained stable on both a like and linked-quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio decreased 3 basis points to 55 basis points due primarily to lower losses in our CRE portfolio. Our loan loss provision remained relatively stable linked-quarter and includes a $25 million provision related to Hurricane Helene. The provision exceeded net charge-offs for the fourth quarter, which along with lower loan balances resulted in a 3 basis point increase in our ALLL ratio to 1.60%. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans remained relatively stable for the fourth consecutive quarter, while total delinquencies were also flat on a linked-quarter basis. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is down $232 million linked-quarter to 1.5% of total loans. Our office reserve increased from 9.7% to 10.4%, driven by continued expected stress in the office sector. Approximately 5.1% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing compared with 6.3% at June 30. Approximately 90% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. Notably, approximately 21% of our office portfolio is housed within our commercial community banking and wealth segments, where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent and overall loss is lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well-reserved, but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio. Turning to capital on Slide 15. Truist CET1 ratio remained relatively stable linked-quarter at 11.6% as current period earnings were offset by the return of $1.2 billion in capital to shareholders via our common stock dividend and the repurchase of $500 million of our shares. Our CET1 capital ratio, including the impact of AOCI, increased from 9.6% to 9.9%, reflecting a $1.6 billion linked-quarter improvement in AOCI due to the decline in longer-term interest rates experienced during the quarter. Although we await the final proposal for the Basel III Endgame rules, we believe that our current strong capital position gives us the unique ability to utilize our future earnings and AOCI accretion to fund balance sheet growth and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. I will now review our updated guidance on Slide 16. Looking into the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to decrease 1.5% from the third quarter of 2024 adjusted revenue of $5.1 billion. We expect net interest income to decrease 1.5% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances and some pressure to our net interest margin due to the temporary lag in our deposit beta. Our net interest income outlook assumes two 25 basis point reductions in the federal funds rate over the remainder of 2024, one cut in November and another cut in December. We expect non-interest income to decline by 2%, driven primarily by lower investment banking and trading revenue as the third quarter performance was helped by some pull-forward of capital markets activity from the fourth into the third quarter. Adjusted expenses of $2.8 billion in the third quarter are expected to increase 4% in the third quarter, driven by investments in areas such as talent, our digital platforms, marketing and risk infrastructure. For the full year 2024, consistent with our previous guidance, we expect revenues to be down 0.5% to down 1%, which reflects our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now expect full-year 2024 adjusted expenses to be slightly lower than 2023 adjusted expenses versus our previous expectation for expenses to remain approximately flat. In terms of asset quality, we previously expected net charge-offs of about 65 basis points for full year 2024, we would now expect net charge-offs to be closer to 60 basis points in 2024. As it relates to buybacks, similar to the third quarter, we are targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17.5% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2024. I will now hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\nBill Rogers: Great. Thank you, Mike. So, in conclusion, I'm really pleased with the progress we've made as a company this year and I'm confident that we've got tremendous momentum within our company with our clients and with our teammates as our value proposition has never been stronger. First, we've got an incredible franchise with leading share in high-growth markets. We've got highly motivated and energized teammates. We have a fulsome set of specialized wholesale and consumer capabilities that our loyal clients value. Our relative capital advantage is a differentiating factor that gives us a unique ability to grow our core banking businesses by serving existing and new clients, invest in our infrastructure and return considerable amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years. As we execute our strategic growth and capital management priorities, we see a significant opportunity to improve our profitability over the medium term. Our path to profitability improvement is multifaceted and a function of client and business growth while maintaining our cost discipline. I can say that I'm encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential we're working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships and verticals and product lines that already exist at Truist. The good news is we see multiple paths and initiatives that with proper execution will result in improved performance, while we don't have to experiment with new products or expand into new markets to achieve our goals. We plan to accomplish all of this while maintaining our expense discipline and focus on generating positive long-term operating leverage, while also continuing to invest in talent, technology and our infrastructure. Although it's too early to provide specific earnings guidance for 2025, based on the current momentum, the confidence in our teams and our franchise, where we are in the planning cycle, we do expect to achieve positive operating leverage next year. Finally, we'll never take for granted our strong track record on asset quality as we continue to focus on maintaining strong risk discipline and controls. I'm as optimistic as ever about Truist's future, especially in light of the success I see every day inside our company. I'd like to thank all of our teammates and all of our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity in moving our company forward. Again, thank you for your interest and investment in Truist. And with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we can may accommodate as many of you on the call today as possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping you could please maybe unpack the fourth quarter margin guidance a bit more. For overall NII, I certainly understand the ongoing pressure on loans, but was hoping you might be able to sort of walk through thoughts on how quickly deposit betas might be able to catch up to help support or ideally enhance the margin and then just make some top-level thoughts about the company's overall rate sensitivity at this point.\nMike Maguire: Yeah. Good morning, Scott. Happy to do that. From a NIM perspective, maybe just to sort of start with the third quarter and give you the trend into the fourth and maybe even give you a sense for kind of where we go from there and I'll link that to the beta. The bulk of the improvement that we saw in the third quarter was really driven by the repositioning. So the 10 basis points from 3.02% to 3.12%. As you look into the fourth quarter, we mentioned the temporary beta lag. We do expect two cuts in the fourth. We did see some improvement in the third, you'll recall. We were better by a basis point on, call it, an average funds rate that was better by 7 basis points for the quarter. So started at, call it, a 15% beta. Our outlook for the fourth quarter is that while we'll accelerate significantly, call it, into the mid, maybe even high 30% from a beta perspective, that will still lag a touch relative to how quickly the assets are repricing. So we see some margin compression there. Maybe it's to the same tune as we guided NII, so call it a 1.5% or so of net interest margin down into the sort of low 3.05%, 3.06% area. We would expect that to catch up very, very early, probably in the first quarter of 2025, and would expect to see the margin stabilize, I'd say, in the first quarter and then begin to improve as we have further cuts as we get into 2025.\nScott Siefers: All right. Perfect. That's great color and thank you. And then just wanted to ask separately. So, you did the really large balance repositioning earlier this year. I've gotten the impression that that was sort of all you planned there, but you have so much capital flexibility relative to so many banks out there. Would -- any thoughts on further opportunities to do so, or is it sort of stand pat on that front?\nMike Maguire: Yeah. Look, I think you're right, and we feel like we took a pretty big swing at this in May and have now fully realized at least the benefit into the run rate in the third quarter. We do think that our capital position is an advantage. We're trying to be patient, very focused on growing the business. Bill's talked a lot about the various initiatives in both of our business segments where we do think we're going to have an opportunity to grow footings and leverage capital. Obviously, as that's been a little slower to develop, we're buying back shares at an elevated level. I think we would expect to continue buying back shares at an elevated level. I think the repositioning incrementally, I don't think we want to ever put the tool back in the toolbox necessarily, but I think it's a lower priority for us based on what else we see in front of us.\nScott Siefers: Yeah. Got it. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nBill Rogers: Betsy.\nMike Maguire: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Bill, you mentioned with proper execution deliver on the goals here, the targets that you have. Could you help us understand what do you mean by proper execution? Is that just hitting the goals or is there a change in how you're operating that delivers proper execution?\nBill Rogers: Yeah, I mean, Betsy, there's a real strong focus on expanding our relationships with our existing clients. I'm really pleased with the momentum we've created in the execution. Coming out of the merger, there was a lot of diversion and a lot of focus on activities of getting clients converted and getting teammates onboarded and all those type things. And that's just way behind us. And now the team's really focused on executing against our priorities. We've got a really strong focus and clarity about what we want to accomplish. So when I say proper execution, maybe it's -- I should better have said continuation of the execution momentum that we've started and you see some of that in this quarter. You see increase in primacy rates, you see that continuation of net new. So all these things that are demonstrable evidence of the fact that we're continuing to expand and grow our relationships with our clients. So proper probably ought to be continuation and improved momentum against existing execution.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then, as we're thinking about the positive operating leverage into 2025, how much of that is being driven by deposit beta lags catching up here with Fed funds? I mean, is that the major driver of how we're thinking about operating leverage as we roll into '25?\nBill Rogers: Well, you've got all the factors that come into it. So, first is the momentum in the business that we have. So take investment banking, let's use that as one example. The momentum we have in this quarter, continuing that type of momentum into next year, as an example. The loan growth activity is going to -- I think we're confident it's going to return. We saw production increases this quarter. Particularly on the consumer side, we saw loan production up around 3%. We saw real increases in the areas that we can lean into. Think about the things you know about like service, finance and Sheffield, and so we saw really good momentum there. Increase in production on the wholesale side. But the utilization was the lowest this quarter. It's been in the last five quarters. So we expect to see some of that return. So we've got some loan dependencies, we've got some executional dependencies, some fee dependencies, and then, as you mentioned, the deposit beta. And I'm really pleased with the team. I mean, I'm -- Mike and team have provided really great leadership, working really closely with Kristin and Donta on the businesses to really be on top of where we are from deposit betas. And Mike indicating, we've already had a little bit of movement, expect a little bit of lag, but, sort of see that transitioning in the first quarter of next year and then continuing from there. And then the final factor is the expense side. So the other side of that is controlling expenses. And hopefully, we're giving good evidence of the fact that we've got a good handle on our expenses. We're going to be down this year versus last year. And I think we've got a really good capacity to correlate our expense growth with our revenue growth opportunity. So it's a lot of things. Maybe it's a long answer to a short question, but all of those things, I think, have the requisite amount of focus and attention and we don't have a single dependency. We're going to manage them all really tightly and really well with a focus on achieving that positive operating leverage.\nBetsy Graseck: Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: Good morning. My first question is a follow-up. Mike, you mentioned a little bit of guidance on the fourth quarter. As we think about the trajectory from here and fully appreciate we're not getting specific '25 color today. As we think about the structure of your asset side versus your liability side, should we assume that from that 3.05%, 3.06% level that assets can start repricing faster than liabilities in 1Q, but then there's a day count impact on NII that's negative or will the assets repricing faster than liabilities go -- come later? And to that end, you mentioned the swaps. If you could give us a little bit more color on the swaps, what the notional active is, what the weighted fixed -- received fixed rate is, so we can factor that into our modeling.\nMike Maguire: Yeah, sure. Good morning, Erika. As it relates to the, I call it, just maybe the NIM trajectory, I think you've got it right. Well, actually, let me say this. So we do expect in the fourth quarter for the beta to accelerate, I mentioned, call it, mid-high 30s. We would expect that to continue and essentially catch up in the first quarter. So at that point, we would expect to actually have the balance sheet behaving a touch liability sensitive again after an asset-sensitive fourth quarter. And so really as we move deeper into '25, again, a lot of variables here. We would expect the net interest margin to begin to expand a touch. So that's a good guide. And I think you mentioned a day count. I'm glad you brought that up. There are two fewer days in the first quarter. So as you think about actual NII dollars, while we might see a more stable earning asset base in the first, we might see a more stable net interest margin, you might still feel a touch of pressure from a dollars of NII perspective. I think I got most of your questions 1a and 1b. On the swaps, let's see, we did -- as you know well, we have two programs that we use to manage our rate position. We've got our receive fixed program, which we primarily rely on to manage our NII sensitivity and risks and opportunities and we have our pay fix program to manage our asset values, manage our capital volatility risk in the future, AOCI, et cetera. We did have some activity in the positions. During the quarter, we added about $15 billion give or take of forward-starting receivers during the third quarter. That takes notional up into the, call it, $60 billion or so area. We also added about $5 billion of pay fix swaps we added to the investment portfolio during the quarter as well. So had some accompanied activity there. In terms of active versus sort of forward-starting, we did have -- I mentioned in our NII results sort of description, we had a touch of a headwind in the third versus the second quarter based on about $12 billion of incremental received fixed swaps becoming active during the quarter. That was a manageable headwind. As we look at the fourth quarter, we really don't have much else coming on throughout the course of the year. We will have more active in 2025, but that's going to come on, frankly, the -- who knows, the curve could change. But based on the curve that we see today, that's going to come on and actually be less of a headwind each quarter into 2025. Our received fixed rate, you asked, Erika, is around 3.40% on that notional.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my follow-up question -- and thanks for all the detail. For Bill, based on what Mike just said, you should have NII growth next year. If everything is supposed to come true that the market's thinking in terms of capital market strength in '25, you'll benefit from that as you did this quarter. If the market is good volatile as it could be after an election and a change in administration, that could be good for your wealth management business as well. So as we think about Truist on offense and fully appreciate that you're aiming for positive operating leverage. Are you thinking about your expense base just -- really just more relative to that revenue -- potential revenue strength in '25? In other words, should we think about Truist on offense rather than, because of this and that, we have to think about managing expenses because of all the issues with the merger integration? So wanted to get your thoughts there. And additionally, some longer-term investors have asked me, why will Truist operate in the mid-teens in terms of ROTCE if their two super-regional peers are aiming to earn in the high-teens or the mid-to-high teens and I suspect that might be a capital adjustment. I know that's a compound question, but I wanted to get your thoughts on both. Thank you so much.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. Thanks for the comprehensive questions. I think you've characterized the first part of that question exactly right, in the sense of that we are on offense and you can feel it in our company, you can feel it in the results, you can see it in the things that we talked about in terms of this third quarter, and you outlined many of those in terms of momentum. We think about the expense side, and this is the concept of what I talked about our commitment to long-term operating leverage is the expenses are correlated to that opportunity. And I think today we've got the calibration correlated. I think, as you noted, it was sort of uncorrelated as we were coming out of the merger. And today, I think we've got a really good handle on the capacity to invest and win and grow and be on offense and have those be correlated. Again, you saw good evidence of that in this quarter. So there isn't a merger hangover or other activity related to the expenses. We've been investing. We're going to continue to invest and we see the results of that in our top-line revenue growth and opportunity. So again, higher correlated and commitment to have an efficient company. So we're operating today at a really much stronger efficiency ratio. So we didn't talk about that. So this commitment to have positive operating leverage on the platform of a really efficient company. So let's put that in one category. And then on the ROTCE side, I think you highlighted sort of the starting point is a little bit different, right, because of the sale of the insurance business and the creation of a lot of capital. So we start sort of from a different framework. I think about it as the speed and increase in terms of return. So, our speed of increase in return, I think, is unparalleled. So where we start from, our ability to deploy capital, both in growing our business and returning capital to our shareholders, I think, has the capacity to grow our ROTCE faster than anybody else. And then once we get to that mid-teens sort of level, then our business model starts to reflect more of what we talked about in the first part of my answer, then I think we sort of catapult from there. But the key is we have the most ability to grow our return over the medium term. Hope that answers it.\nErika Najarian: Helpful. Thank you so much. Yeah, perfect.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. I guess maybe just the first question and apologies if I missed it. I think you mentioned pace of buybacks relative to the $0.5 billion this quarter. Should we -- is there room or are you thinking about increasing the pace of those buybacks in the near term if loan growth is muted or should we assume that $500 million is relatively locked-in for the next several quarters?\nBill Rogers: Yeah, this is Bill. So I think we ought to think about it as it's going to stay at an elevated level for some period of time. We've been very clear that we see opportunities to grow our business. So, we want to make sure that we've got ample capital to do that and invest in the growth. If we see that as being much longer than sort of our current view, we have the opportunity to recalibrate or to stay at elevated levels longer or to increase those elevated levels. But for now, I think, and so we talked about the fourth quarter and how we would enter the first part of next year, we're doing that with a lot of confidence in the ability to grow our business.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Understood. And just on that, and I think you responded slightly to Betsy's question earlier, if you think -- from an outside standpoint, and you mentioned that Truist is now like done with the overhang with the deal. Just remind us, Bill, when we think about the momentum and growth, where across your businesses do you expect to grow market share? And do you feel like you're at a point where the bank will stop [leading] (ph) market share to smaller or out-of-market competitors who have been aggressive in terms of hiring across the Southeast? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yeah, I mean, let's talk about market share in terms of all of our businesses. So, starting with the investment banking side, we've increased market share consistently through this year in virtually every discipline. So, on the margin increased share in every discipline. And then when I think about share, I think about the things that we talked about in terms of, for example, net new. We've really had a really strong focus on net new growth. So when I think about share, it's growing our -- growing share with clients. So increasing the number of net new clients, and that's sort of an incredible hallmark. And then when I think about share, it's primacy within our existing client base. So, are we growing our primacy in terms of our share? And this quarter, particularly, both on the wholesale side in terms of treasury penetration and on the consumer side in terms of product penetration, we grew primacy with all of our clients. So, yes, we have a lot of new clients coming into our markets. I mean, a lot of new competitors coming into our markets, because we have great markets, but our primacy and our net new and our capacity to serve our clients and grow in our share as we look at the important parts of share, I feel really, really comfortable with. And that -- and that's going to continue. So that pace is granted, started slower out of the merger, but now is at a really good pace and I expect that to continue.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Noted. Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi, good morning.\nBill Rogers: Hey, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Bill, we get more meat on the bones for the financial expectations in 2025 and beyond, such as the definition of long-term when you talk about operating leverage in 2025, are you talking about more than $1, give some kind of level of the term -- medium-term when you talk about returns, what year are you thinking? And the reason I ask is, I'm trying to better understand the accountability of management to shareholders. And I've written about this, but in the third quarter, you lowered the return targets from 2019 when it was low-20s to mid-teens. At the same time, you granted a special extra leadership bonus award to some executive officers and that was on top of awards they already get PSUs, RSUs, LTIP, annual incentive awards. And for what looks like fixing a problem that Truist caused, the asset-liability management pre the current CFO. And then there's the question about morale for those who didn't get the award, I mean, two of the five named executive officers, I recognize, Bill, you did not get that award, but there's others in the 24-member operating committee who I assume did not get that. So aside from the morale and reconciling pay with performance, I'm just looking at today's slides and I don't see the word shareholders when you say on the slide that says mission, on the slide that says Why Truist? And you have taken some steps. You restructured the Board, the balance sheet, you reordered the company, you sold TIS -- TIH, you cut expenses, but still shareholders, the stocks underperformed. It's the bottom line. Stocks underperformed over most time frames since you announced the merger. So again, that's my big tee-up. Can you give us more detail on financial expectations after the fourth quarter and the key metrics that you think should drive a higher stock price? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Sure. Thanks, Mike. And thanks for acknowledging the efforts that have been underway. Let me first say, as it relates to the deck, every slide is about shareholders. So just want to be really, really clear about that. Everything we do is about shareholders. So that is all in context. As it relates to the ROTCE specifically, I would say what we do -- we did is reset sort of post the sale of TIH. So it was appropriate to sort of reset the return post TIH because we generate a lot of capital and we changed the construct of our business in terms of return. We created a significant amount of capital, so that actually lowers the return to create that capital. But as we deploy that capital, we increase that return. And I think as I said earlier to an answer, I think our capacity to increase that return is we're in the best position of anybody because we've got that capital and that capacity to deploy it quickly both in our business and as a return to our shareholders. So we raised it efficiently and I think we have a chance to deploy and return it efficiently. In terms of the elements that are part of -- a part of that return, hopefully, those are many things that I've talked about and focus on things that are critical to expanding relationships with existing clients in markets and places where we already have committed capital and resources. So these are things that have higher returns and faster paybacks. So if you think about our strategy, it's not focused on these long-term paybacks and going to markets and trying new things, this is about really executing against the opportunities that we have in our existing franchise and increasing that return faster with higher paybacks. When I talk about medium-term, the definition of that is somewhere in that three-year kind of range, but that also depends on sort of where the economy is and what we see in terms of growth and what we see in terms of rates. So that could go faster, that could go slower. But the key is we'll have momentum against that. And again, I think you see that in this quarter. I think you'll continue to see that. We'll use the capital as an answer to the earlier question. We'll use that capital as a lever. So we can return that capital in many ways to the shareholders, all of which will increase returns, I think, faster than others are capable of doing. I have tremendous confidence in our team. Again, I think you see evidence of many of that. And then as it relates to the operating leverage, we just have to let us get into the year a little bit more, let us sort of see where things are coming in terms of where rates are going and where we see asset growth. But that commitment to positive operating leverage is a continuous one. So, I think we'll make that transition next year, as I said earlier, and then we'll continue to improve on that transition year-over-year as the returns improve to the earlier part of my answer.\nMike Mayo: And then just a follow-up to the incentive -- the incentives for management. I think you changed and I cuddled up with the Page 67 of the proxy last night, that's what you do if you're a bank analyst for a long time. And I'm just trying -- and I also saw the release that you had this quarter -- or then the third quarter and it looks like there's like 12 financial metrics and then five non-financial metrics and there's so many different metrics that driving compensation. If you had to pick one or two key metrics that we on the outside can monitor and focus on that should drive shareholder value, what should they be?\nBill Rogers: Yeah. I mean, appreciate you diving into the proxy. I think as you dive into that proxy, you'll see compensation based on performance. So I think you'll see that actually quite clearly. So, don't assume that we don't have that mentality at this company. And I think the primary measures that we look at are ROTCE and growth in our business. So you have to have really good return and you have to have growth. So we're looking at total book value per share plus dividends plus ROTCE. So total absolute growth and total relative return growth.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: And I think those, in fairness, are the highest correlated to share price return.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned about increasing in the fourth quarter investments related to risk infrastructure. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what that is and the drivers of, I guess, why now?\nBill Rogers: Yeah, I mean, Matt, that's a continuation of the investments that we have in the risk infrastructure. So -- and that's everything you can think of in terms of how we build a more enduring consistent infrastructure. So think about the investments in cyber, think about the investments in data, all the tight things that go along with that investment. They're bumpy by quarter, but they are increasing and part of our overall guidance. And so in the fourth quarter, we just had some specific items that were more unique to that quarter, but they're also factored into the guidance that we've given on positive operating leverage for next year. We're going to continue to invest in infrastructure. This isn't a one-time unusual thing. This is a continuous investment for a company our size with the responsibilities and the obligations we have to our clients, regulators and our shareholders.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: And I know when you combine the two companies, you guys made a lot of investments in, call it, the gut to the company, taking the best of both and creating some new platforms. Maybe just like give us a quick snapshot of like what is there still to do? Like, is it catching up on something? Is it just kind of business as usual staying up-to-date like all the other banks are doing?\nBill Rogers: Yeah. I think in terms of basically the risk infrastructure, I mean, the -- we've seen the elevation of expectations of how we manage data. We've seen elevated expectations in AI and the investments that we want to make there. We've seen elevated expectations in terms of cyber. So they're really more -- not things that were left out of the merger, but things that are just continuous improvement of what we want to do and be responsive to the opportunities and challenges that exist in our -- in financial services.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Bill. Hi, Mike.\nBill Rogers: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us, Bill, in your prepared remarks and you talked about market share in response to a question, but you were talking about wallet share, how in some of your businesses you're gaining wallet share. Can you share with us how can we as outsiders measure that success, growing that wallet share? And second, what are you doing to grow that wallet share that's showing up that maybe you didn't see three years or four years ago?\nBill Rogers: Yeah. I mean the best way to see the wallet share gain is see it in the overall returns of our business. So I -- if you think about the return expectations and increasing ROTCE, think about that for us as increasing ROA. Think about that as the focus. So we have the assets deployed, we have resources deployed and we increased the penetration. This time we talked about checking primacy up 1%. We talked about treasury management penetration of our commercial base up 1%. So hopefully, we're giving you that kind of information that's consistent to demonstrate that primacy, but you primarily see it in the returns. So that's the focus. I mean, that's the big way we drive returns for this business is improving our improving our primacy with our clients.\nGerard Cassidy: And following up on that primacy comment, Bill, how do you guys intersect or interlock your pursuit of the digital channel with primacy? It seems like the industry you guys included, there is the optimal kind of mix is having physical branches as well as the digital channel. Do most of the primacy relationships still come through the brick-and-mortar or are you seeing some success in building it through the digital channel?\nBill Rogers: Well, you're really on it and the answer is both. We have this concept called T3. So this concept of that touch and technology equals trust. So what we want to do and the capability that we've built, for example, our clients in Truist Assist. So, our digital clients can you have a virtual assistant to sort of help them in their transactions, but what we believe is that they also have the opportunity to then transition to a human interaction with that. So you've got to sort of supply both of those opportunities. When a client is interacting with us digitally and shows up in our branch, we want to be able to follow up on that transaction and continue that process. So I think they're actually both really important as part of the overall process. And it never becomes more clear in something like we've experienced in the last few weeks in the storms. So those economies go to cash during that particular time. So our branches and our ATMs are the most important thing that those communities need at that time. They don't have access to digital, Internet is down, power is down. So being able to toggle between both of those and making sure that we serve our clients in the way that they can be best be served. And that's why I led with that in this particular commentary is just to show how important both of those things are because the goal is to create an enduring relationship with the community and with the client. And we do that by investing in the channels that are most important to them, when they're most important to them.\nGerard Cassidy: Appreciate that. Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over for any closing remarks.\nBrad Milsaps: Okay. Thank you, Betsy.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Before we discuss the third quarter's results, I'd like to begin with purpose on Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company. We're dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. It's the foundation for everything we do and the belief in this mission has never been more important given the extraordinary start to the fourth quarter with two devastating hurricanes. In the days since these storms cut a path through the Southeast, Truist's humanitarian aid team and hundreds of teammate volunteers have been out and forced to help our communities. I spent time in recent days with teammates in some of the hardest hit areas. These teammates are doing just incredible heroic work, helping their neighbors, distributing critical supplies and making sure Truist facilities were open to serve our clients even as their own lives have been upended. In addition to contributions from the foundation, we've set up several sites where we've distributed supplies. We've also deployed mobile services for basic needs like showers and laundering facilities as well as mobile branches, ATMs and generators to serve clients in areas without power. This recovery is going to take time, and we're going to play a significant role in helping these communities recover and rebuild in the days, weeks, months and even years to come. They can count on Truist. Okay. Let's turn to discussing our third quarter results on Slide 5. We've made demonstrable progress on our strategic priorities during the quarter, as I'm proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum and sound asset quality metrics. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $0.99 a share, adjusted EPS was $0.97 per share, which excluded a few small discrete items that Mike will discuss later in the call. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we grew adjusted revenue 2.4% on a linked-quarter basis due to another strong quarter of investment banking and trading income and a full quarter's impact on the balance sheet repositioning we completed during the second quarter. Second, our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost. As a result of these efforts, our efficiency ratio improved on both a linked and like-quarter basis. Adjusted expenses increased by less than 1% linked-quarter and declined for the third consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. Expenses are now projected to decline sin 2024 compared to 2023, which is an improvement from our original commitment to keep expenses flat for the year. Non-performing loans remained relatively stable while net charge-offs were better than our expectations. We did record a $25 million loan loss provision during the quarter specifically related to Hurricane Helene, which Mike will discuss in more detail later. We also returned $1.2 billion worth of capital to our shareholders through our common dividend and repurchase of $500 million worth of common stock as part of the $5 billion repurchase plan our Board approved in late July -- I mean, late June, excuse me. We anticipate repurchasing another $500 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. Our CET1 capital ratio remained relatively stable, leaving us well-positioned to grow our balance sheet and to continue to return significant amount of capital to shareholders. Finally, we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core consumer and small business and wholesale banking businesses. Although average loans declined during the quarter, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased loan production, greater wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company, all while continuing to maintain our expense discipline and investing in important areas like technology and our risk infrastructure. Maintaining this momentum and continuing to execute against our strategic growth priorities will be key to reaching our mid-teens medium-term ROATCE target, which we also announced during the quarter. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the quarterly results, I want to spend a little time reviewing the positive momentum we're seeing within business segments and within our digital initiatives on Slides 6 and 7. In Consumer and Small Business Banking, I'm encouraged by the momentum as we experienced an increase in loan production in key focus areas within our lending portfolio, and we continue to acquire new clients and households through both digital and traditional channels. Average consumer loan balance remained relatively stable linked-quarter as growth in other consumer, which includes our specialty consumer lending verticals, was offset by lower residential mortgage and home equity loans. We did experience a 3% linked-quarter increase in consumer loan production driven by non-real estate lending, which drove period-end indirect auto and other consumer balances, each higher by 2% on a linked-quarter basis. Importantly, we're not sacrificing our credit standards or pricing discipline to drive growth. Credit metrics remain relatively stable and new consumer loan production spreads are accretive to the portfolio. Although overall deposit growth remains muted, we're continuing to add new clients and households. We opened nearly 200,000 new digital loan and deposit accounts during the quarter, including over 75,000 new-to-bank clients through our digital channels, which represents a 35% increase over the third quarter of last year. Net new checking account growth was once again positive in the third quarter as we grew 40,000 new consumer and business accounts, bringing our total to 108,000 year-to-date. Not only are we adding new households, but primacy rates and client retention also continue to increase due to improvements to the client experience as we rolled out more than 130 enhancements to our digital experience during the quarter. In wholesale, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of improved production, increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company. During the quarter, we saw a 1% growth in commercial deposits and a 4% increase in wholesale lending production, which was offset by lower line utilization and higher paydowns due in part to greater capital markets activity, which is an area where we have invested consistently. The third quarter represents the strongest capital markets quarter we've reported since 2021 as investment banking revenues increased 79% year-over-year and 43% year-to-date. We experienced record quarterly performance in equity capital markets, investment-grade issuance, public finance and asset securitization. The growth is tied to our focus on gaining greater mindshare with our clients across our industry verticals, which has led to an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines. We're continuing to invest in our wholesale platform as we've made several key new hires this quarter in commercial banking, corporate banking, investment banking, wealth and payments and plan to add additional talent in the fourth quarter and beyond. These new teammates complement our great existing teams and have significant experience in many cases from larger institutions and are attracted to our results-oriented culture. As I mentioned last quarter, we have a specific focus on further building out our middle-market commercial lending segment, which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional businesses. We'll primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise where we've gained significant share. We also continue to enhance our wholesale digital capabilities by improving the client experience. During the quarter, we launched several significant enhancements to the Truist One View platform, including the ability for clients to securely chat directly with treasury management specialists. Enhancing the client experience and growing our digital capabilities are important parts of our strategy, which I'll discuss in more detail on Slide 7. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew 6% and digital transactions increased 15% compared to the third quarter of 2023. We continue to migrate clients towards self-service capabilities, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions, which are up 36% year-over-year. In addition to an increase in account openings, we're also seeing an improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up significantly over the third quarter of last year. Our recently enhanced digital deposit application experience has helped drive a 49% increase in mobile device applications, which now account for 72% of total digital applications. These improvements also drove a 500 basis point linked-quarter increase in the conversion rate on new digital applications, driving productivity and leading strong digital client satisfaction scores. We're not only better serving and growing with our clients, but we're also doing that more efficiently. So, now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results and I'll come back after that and close us out. Great. Thank you, Mike. So, in conclusion, I'm really pleased with the progress we've made as a company this year and I'm confident that we've got tremendous momentum within our company with our clients and with our teammates as our value proposition has never been stronger. First, we've got an incredible franchise with leading share in high-growth markets. We've got highly motivated and energized teammates. We have a fulsome set of specialized wholesale and consumer capabilities that our loyal clients value. Our relative capital advantage is a differentiating factor that gives us a unique ability to grow our core banking businesses by serving existing and new clients, invest in our infrastructure and return considerable amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years. As we execute our strategic growth and capital management priorities, we see a significant opportunity to improve our profitability over the medium term. Our path to profitability improvement is multifaceted and a function of client and business growth while maintaining our cost discipline. I can say that I'm encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential we're working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships and verticals and product lines that already exist at Truist. The good news is we see multiple paths and initiatives that with proper execution will result in improved performance, while we don't have to experiment with new products or expand into new markets to achieve our goals. We plan to accomplish all of this while maintaining our expense discipline and focus on generating positive long-term operating leverage, while also continuing to invest in talent, technology and our infrastructure. Although it's too early to provide specific earnings guidance for 2025, based on the current momentum, the confidence in our teams and our franchise, where we are in the planning cycle, we do expect to achieve positive operating leverage next year. Finally, we'll never take for granted our strong track record on asset quality as we continue to focus on maintaining strong risk discipline and controls. I'm as optimistic as ever about Truist's future, especially in light of the success I see every day inside our company. I'd like to thank all of our teammates and all of our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity in moving our company forward. Again, thank you for your interest and investment in Truist. And with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A. Betsy. Yeah, I mean, Betsy, there's a real strong focus on expanding our relationships with our existing clients. I'm really pleased with the momentum we've created in the execution. Coming out of the merger, there was a lot of diversion and a lot of focus on activities of getting clients converted and getting teammates onboarded and all those type things. And that's just way behind us. And now the team's really focused on executing against our priorities. We've got a really strong focus and clarity about what we want to accomplish. So when I say proper execution, maybe it's -- I should better have said continuation of the execution momentum that we've started and you see some of that in this quarter. You see increase in primacy rates, you see that continuation of net new. So all these things that are demonstrable evidence of the fact that we're continuing to expand and grow our relationships with our clients. So proper probably ought to be continuation and improved momentum against existing execution. Well, you've got all the factors that come into it. So, first is the momentum in the business that we have. So take investment banking, let's use that as one example. The momentum we have in this quarter, continuing that type of momentum into next year, as an example. The loan growth activity is going to -- I think we're confident it's going to return. We saw production increases this quarter. Particularly on the consumer side, we saw loan production up around 3%. We saw real increases in the areas that we can lean into. Think about the things you know about like service, finance and Sheffield, and so we saw really good momentum there. Increase in production on the wholesale side. But the utilization was the lowest this quarter. It's been in the last five quarters. So we expect to see some of that return. So we've got some loan dependencies, we've got some executional dependencies, some fee dependencies, and then, as you mentioned, the deposit beta. And I'm really pleased with the team. I mean, I'm -- Mike and team have provided really great leadership, working really closely with Kristin and Donta on the businesses to really be on top of where we are from deposit betas. And Mike indicating, we've already had a little bit of movement, expect a little bit of lag, but, sort of see that transitioning in the first quarter of next year and then continuing from there. And then the final factor is the expense side. So the other side of that is controlling expenses. And hopefully, we're giving good evidence of the fact that we've got a good handle on our expenses. We're going to be down this year versus last year. And I think we've got a really good capacity to correlate our expense growth with our revenue growth opportunity. So it's a lot of things. Maybe it's a long answer to a short question, but all of those things, I think, have the requisite amount of focus and attention and we don't have a single dependency. We're going to manage them all really tightly and really well with a focus on achieving that positive operating leverage. Good morning. Yeah. Thanks for the comprehensive questions. I think you've characterized the first part of that question exactly right, in the sense of that we are on offense and you can feel it in our company, you can feel it in the results, you can see it in the things that we talked about in terms of this third quarter, and you outlined many of those in terms of momentum. We think about the expense side, and this is the concept of what I talked about our commitment to long-term operating leverage is the expenses are correlated to that opportunity. And I think today we've got the calibration correlated. I think, as you noted, it was sort of uncorrelated as we were coming out of the merger. And today, I think we've got a really good handle on the capacity to invest and win and grow and be on offense and have those be correlated. Again, you saw good evidence of that in this quarter. So there isn't a merger hangover or other activity related to the expenses. We've been investing. We're going to continue to invest and we see the results of that in our top-line revenue growth and opportunity. So again, higher correlated and commitment to have an efficient company. So we're operating today at a really much stronger efficiency ratio. So we didn't talk about that. So this commitment to have positive operating leverage on the platform of a really efficient company. So let's put that in one category. And then on the ROTCE side, I think you highlighted sort of the starting point is a little bit different, right, because of the sale of the insurance business and the creation of a lot of capital. So we start sort of from a different framework. I think about it as the speed and increase in terms of return. So, our speed of increase in return, I think, is unparalleled. So where we start from, our ability to deploy capital, both in growing our business and returning capital to our shareholders, I think, has the capacity to grow our ROTCE faster than anybody else. And then once we get to that mid-teens sort of level, then our business model starts to reflect more of what we talked about in the first part of my answer, then I think we sort of catapult from there. But the key is we have the most ability to grow our return over the medium term. Hope that answers it. Yeah, this is Bill. So I think we ought to think about it as it's going to stay at an elevated level for some period of time. We've been very clear that we see opportunities to grow our business. So, we want to make sure that we've got ample capital to do that and invest in the growth. If we see that as being much longer than sort of our current view, we have the opportunity to recalibrate or to stay at elevated levels longer or to increase those elevated levels. But for now, I think, and so we talked about the fourth quarter and how we would enter the first part of next year, we're doing that with a lot of confidence in the ability to grow our business. Yeah, I mean, let's talk about market share in terms of all of our businesses. So, starting with the investment banking side, we've increased market share consistently through this year in virtually every discipline. So, on the margin increased share in every discipline. And then when I think about share, I think about the things that we talked about in terms of, for example, net new. We've really had a really strong focus on net new growth. So when I think about share, it's growing our -- growing share with clients. So increasing the number of net new clients, and that's sort of an incredible hallmark. And then when I think about share, it's primacy within our existing client base. So, are we growing our primacy in terms of our share? And this quarter, particularly, both on the wholesale side in terms of treasury penetration and on the consumer side in terms of product penetration, we grew primacy with all of our clients. So, yes, we have a lot of new clients coming into our markets. I mean, a lot of new competitors coming into our markets, because we have great markets, but our primacy and our net new and our capacity to serve our clients and grow in our share as we look at the important parts of share, I feel really, really comfortable with. And that -- and that's going to continue. So that pace is granted, started slower out of the merger, but now is at a really good pace and I expect that to continue. Hey, Mike. Sure. Thanks, Mike. And thanks for acknowledging the efforts that have been underway. Let me first say, as it relates to the deck, every slide is about shareholders. So just want to be really, really clear about that. Everything we do is about shareholders. So that is all in context. As it relates to the ROTCE specifically, I would say what we do -- we did is reset sort of post the sale of TIH. So it was appropriate to sort of reset the return post TIH because we generate a lot of capital and we changed the construct of our business in terms of return. We created a significant amount of capital, so that actually lowers the return to create that capital. But as we deploy that capital, we increase that return. And I think as I said earlier to an answer, I think our capacity to increase that return is we're in the best position of anybody because we've got that capital and that capacity to deploy it quickly both in our business and as a return to our shareholders. So we raised it efficiently and I think we have a chance to deploy and return it efficiently. In terms of the elements that are part of -- a part of that return, hopefully, those are many things that I've talked about and focus on things that are critical to expanding relationships with existing clients in markets and places where we already have committed capital and resources. So these are things that have higher returns and faster paybacks. So if you think about our strategy, it's not focused on these long-term paybacks and going to markets and trying new things, this is about really executing against the opportunities that we have in our existing franchise and increasing that return faster with higher paybacks. When I talk about medium-term, the definition of that is somewhere in that three-year kind of range, but that also depends on sort of where the economy is and what we see in terms of growth and what we see in terms of rates. So that could go faster, that could go slower. But the key is we'll have momentum against that. And again, I think you see that in this quarter. I think you'll continue to see that. We'll use the capital as an answer to the earlier question. We'll use that capital as a lever. So we can return that capital in many ways to the shareholders, all of which will increase returns, I think, faster than others are capable of doing. I have tremendous confidence in our team. Again, I think you see evidence of many of that. And then as it relates to the operating leverage, we just have to let us get into the year a little bit more, let us sort of see where things are coming in terms of where rates are going and where we see asset growth. But that commitment to positive operating leverage is a continuous one. So, I think we'll make that transition next year, as I said earlier, and then we'll continue to improve on that transition year-over-year as the returns improve to the earlier part of my answer. Yeah. I mean, appreciate you diving into the proxy. I think as you dive into that proxy, you'll see compensation based on performance. So I think you'll see that actually quite clearly. So, don't assume that we don't have that mentality at this company. And I think the primary measures that we look at are ROTCE and growth in our business. So you have to have really good return and you have to have growth. So we're looking at total book value per share plus dividends plus ROTCE. So total absolute growth and total relative return growth. And I think those, in fairness, are the highest correlated to share price return. Yeah, I mean, Matt, that's a continuation of the investments that we have in the risk infrastructure. So -- and that's everything you can think of in terms of how we build a more enduring consistent infrastructure. So think about the investments in cyber, think about the investments in data, all the tight things that go along with that investment. They're bumpy by quarter, but they are increasing and part of our overall guidance. And so in the fourth quarter, we just had some specific items that were more unique to that quarter, but they're also factored into the guidance that we've given on positive operating leverage for next year. We're going to continue to invest in infrastructure. This isn't a one-time unusual thing. This is a continuous investment for a company our size with the responsibilities and the obligations we have to our clients, regulators and our shareholders. Yeah. I think in terms of basically the risk infrastructure, I mean, the -- we've seen the elevation of expectations of how we manage data. We've seen elevated expectations in AI and the investments that we want to make there. We've seen elevated expectations in terms of cyber. So they're really more -- not things that were left out of the merger, but things that are just continuous improvement of what we want to do and be responsive to the opportunities and challenges that exist in our -- in financial services. Hey, Gerard. Yeah. I mean the best way to see the wallet share gain is see it in the overall returns of our business. So I -- if you think about the return expectations and increasing ROTCE, think about that for us as increasing ROA. Think about that as the focus. So we have the assets deployed, we have resources deployed and we increased the penetration. This time we talked about checking primacy up 1%. We talked about treasury management penetration of our commercial base up 1%. So hopefully, we're giving you that kind of information that's consistent to demonstrate that primacy, but you primarily see it in the returns. So that's the focus. I mean, that's the big way we drive returns for this business is improving our improving our primacy with our clients. Well, you're really on it and the answer is both. We have this concept called T3. So this concept of that touch and technology equals trust. So what we want to do and the capability that we've built, for example, our clients in Truist Assist. So, our digital clients can you have a virtual assistant to sort of help them in their transactions, but what we believe is that they also have the opportunity to then transition to a human interaction with that. So you've got to sort of supply both of those opportunities. When a client is interacting with us digitally and shows up in our branch, we want to be able to follow up on that transaction and continue that process. So I think they're actually both really important as part of the overall process. And it never becomes more clear in something like we've experienced in the last few weeks in the storms. So those economies go to cash during that particular time. So our branches and our ATMs are the most important thing that those communities need at that time. They don't have access to digital, Internet is down, power is down. So being able to toggle between both of those and making sure that we serve our clients in the way that they can be best be served. And that's why I led with that in this particular commentary is just to show how important both of those things are because the goal is to create an enduring relationship with the community and with the client. And we do that by investing in the channels that are most important to them, when they're most important to them."

            "name": "Mike Maguire",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As a high-level summary, we reported third quarter 2024 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $0.99 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $0.97 per share, which included a $36 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after-tax increase to the gain on sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and a $16 million pretax or another $0.01 per share after-tax reduction on the FDIC special assessment. Total revenue adjusted for the losses on the available-for-sale investment securities that were sold in the second quarter increased by 2.4% linked quarter due to a 2.2% increase in net interest income and 3.1% growth in non-interest income driven primarily by growth in investment banking and trading revenue. Adjusted expenses increased 0.9% linked-quarter but were down approximately 2.3% on a like-quarter basis, reflecting lower personnel costs. Moving on to capital. Our CET1 ratio remained relatively stable linked-quarter at 11.6% as current period earnings and a smaller balance sheet were offset by the payment of our common dividend and share repurchases completed during the quarter. From a credit perspective, net charge-offs declined by 3 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and our non-performing loans remained relatively stable both on a like and linked-quarter basis. Next, getting into additional detail, I'll cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans decreased $3 billion or 1% on a sequential basis, reflecting overall weaker commercial client demand and line utilization, partially offset by modest growth in consumer loans. Average commercial loans decreased by $3.2 billion or 1.7%, primarily due to a decline in C&I balances driven again by lower line utilization and at least in part by greater capital markets activity. In our consumer portfolio, average loans remained relatively stable linked-quarter as growth in indirect auto and service finance was offset with lower residential mortgage loans. As Bill mentioned, production improved in both consumer and wholesale lending, but paydowns and runoff in certain categories like commercial and residential real estate will likely result in continued pressure on an average balance basis in the fourth quarter, likely similar to the rate of decline that we experienced in the third quarter. Moving to deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1% sequentially or $3.7 billion with approximately $1.7 billion of the decline due to lower brokered deposits. Average non-interest bearing deposits decreased 1.4% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged versus the second quarter of 2024. The $1.7 billion decline in average brokered deposits reduced our total and interest-bearing deposit costs by 1 basis point sequentially to 2.08% and 2.88%, respectively. Overall, we expect deposit balances to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 12. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 2.2% linked-quarter or $77 million, primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning we completed during the second quarter, a reduction in higher-cost wholesale funding and the impact of one additional day in the third quarter. These tailwinds were partially offset by the impact of additional received fixed interest-rate swaps that became effective during the quarter and by lower commercial loan balances. Reported net interest margin increased 10 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.12% due primarily to the securities repositioning I just mentioned and a reduction in higher cost wholesale funding. Returning to non-interest income on Slide 12. Adjusted non-interest income increased $45 million or 3.1% relative to the second quarter. The linked-quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher other income and higher investment banking and trading income, which improved $46 million due to higher M&A, equity capital markets and investment-grade fees. Adjusted non-interest income increased 11% on a like-quarter basis due to higher investment banking and trading income and higher service charge on deposit income. Next, I'll cover non-interest expense on Slide 13. GAAP expenses of $2.9 billion decreased $167 million linked-quarter, primarily due to lower other expenses as the second quarter included a $150 million charitable donation. Regulatory costs decreased by $34 million, partially due to a $16 million reduction on the FDIC special assessment, which was recognized in 3Q24. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 0.9% sequentially due to higher professional fees, other, and marketing expense, partially offset by lower personnel expense. On a like-quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined by $67 million or 2.3%, reflecting lower personnel and other expenses. Now, moving to asset quality on Slide 14. Asset quality remained stable on both a like and linked-quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio decreased 3 basis points to 55 basis points due primarily to lower losses in our CRE portfolio. Our loan loss provision remained relatively stable linked-quarter and includes a $25 million provision related to Hurricane Helene. The provision exceeded net charge-offs for the fourth quarter, which along with lower loan balances resulted in a 3 basis point increase in our ALLL ratio to 1.60%. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans remained relatively stable for the fourth consecutive quarter, while total delinquencies were also flat on a linked-quarter basis. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is down $232 million linked-quarter to 1.5% of total loans. Our office reserve increased from 9.7% to 10.4%, driven by continued expected stress in the office sector. Approximately 5.1% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing compared with 6.3% at June 30. Approximately 90% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. Notably, approximately 21% of our office portfolio is housed within our commercial community banking and wealth segments, where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent and overall loss is lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well-reserved, but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio. Turning to capital on Slide 15. Truist CET1 ratio remained relatively stable linked-quarter at 11.6% as current period earnings were offset by the return of $1.2 billion in capital to shareholders via our common stock dividend and the repurchase of $500 million of our shares. Our CET1 capital ratio, including the impact of AOCI, increased from 9.6% to 9.9%, reflecting a $1.6 billion linked-quarter improvement in AOCI due to the decline in longer-term interest rates experienced during the quarter. Although we await the final proposal for the Basel III Endgame rules, we believe that our current strong capital position gives us the unique ability to utilize our future earnings and AOCI accretion to fund balance sheet growth and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. I will now review our updated guidance on Slide 16. Looking into the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to decrease 1.5% from the third quarter of 2024 adjusted revenue of $5.1 billion. We expect net interest income to decrease 1.5% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances and some pressure to our net interest margin due to the temporary lag in our deposit beta. Our net interest income outlook assumes two 25 basis point reductions in the federal funds rate over the remainder of 2024, one cut in November and another cut in December. We expect non-interest income to decline by 2%, driven primarily by lower investment banking and trading revenue as the third quarter performance was helped by some pull-forward of capital markets activity from the fourth into the third quarter. Adjusted expenses of $2.8 billion in the third quarter are expected to increase 4% in the third quarter, driven by investments in areas such as talent, our digital platforms, marketing and risk infrastructure. For the full year 2024, consistent with our previous guidance, we expect revenues to be down 0.5% to down 1%, which reflects our updated outlook for the fourth quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now expect full-year 2024 adjusted expenses to be slightly lower than 2023 adjusted expenses versus our previous expectation for expenses to remain approximately flat. In terms of asset quality, we previously expected net charge-offs of about 65 basis points for full year 2024, we would now expect net charge-offs to be closer to 60 basis points in 2024. As it relates to buybacks, similar to the third quarter, we are targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17.5% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2024. I will now hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Yeah. Good morning, Scott. Happy to do that. From a NIM perspective, maybe just to sort of start with the third quarter and give you the trend into the fourth and maybe even give you a sense for kind of where we go from there and I'll link that to the beta. The bulk of the improvement that we saw in the third quarter was really driven by the repositioning. So the 10 basis points from 3.02% to 3.12%. As you look into the fourth quarter, we mentioned the temporary beta lag. We do expect two cuts in the fourth. We did see some improvement in the third, you'll recall. We were better by a basis point on, call it, an average funds rate that was better by 7 basis points for the quarter. So started at, call it, a 15% beta. Our outlook for the fourth quarter is that while we'll accelerate significantly, call it, into the mid, maybe even high 30% from a beta perspective, that will still lag a touch relative to how quickly the assets are repricing. So we see some margin compression there. Maybe it's to the same tune as we guided NII, so call it a 1.5% or so of net interest margin down into the sort of low 3.05%, 3.06% area. We would expect that to catch up very, very early, probably in the first quarter of 2025, and would expect to see the margin stabilize, I'd say, in the first quarter and then begin to improve as we have further cuts as we get into 2025. Yeah. Look, I think you're right, and we feel like we took a pretty big swing at this in May and have now fully realized at least the benefit into the run rate in the third quarter. We do think that our capital position is an advantage. We're trying to be patient, very focused on growing the business. Bill's talked a lot about the various initiatives in both of our business segments where we do think we're going to have an opportunity to grow footings and leverage capital. Obviously, as that's been a little slower to develop, we're buying back shares at an elevated level. I think we would expect to continue buying back shares at an elevated level. I think the repositioning incrementally, I don't think we want to ever put the tool back in the toolbox necessarily, but I think it's a lower priority for us based on what else we see in front of us. Good morning, Betsy. Yeah, sure. Good morning, Erika. As it relates to the, I call it, just maybe the NIM trajectory, I think you've got it right. Well, actually, let me say this. So we do expect in the fourth quarter for the beta to accelerate, I mentioned, call it, mid-high 30s. We would expect that to continue and essentially catch up in the first quarter. So at that point, we would expect to actually have the balance sheet behaving a touch liability sensitive again after an asset-sensitive fourth quarter. And so really as we move deeper into '25, again, a lot of variables here. We would expect the net interest margin to begin to expand a touch. So that's a good guide. And I think you mentioned a day count. I'm glad you brought that up. There are two fewer days in the first quarter. So as you think about actual NII dollars, while we might see a more stable earning asset base in the first, we might see a more stable net interest margin, you might still feel a touch of pressure from a dollars of NII perspective. I think I got most of your questions 1a and 1b. On the swaps, let's see, we did -- as you know well, we have two programs that we use to manage our rate position. We've got our receive fixed program, which we primarily rely on to manage our NII sensitivity and risks and opportunities and we have our pay fix program to manage our asset values, manage our capital volatility risk in the future, AOCI, et cetera. We did have some activity in the positions. During the quarter, we added about $15 billion give or take of forward-starting receivers during the third quarter. That takes notional up into the, call it, $60 billion or so area. We also added about $5 billion of pay fix swaps we added to the investment portfolio during the quarter as well. So had some accompanied activity there. In terms of active versus sort of forward-starting, we did have -- I mentioned in our NII results sort of description, we had a touch of a headwind in the third versus the second quarter based on about $12 billion of incremental received fixed swaps becoming active during the quarter. That was a manageable headwind. As we look at the fourth quarter, we really don't have much else coming on throughout the course of the year. We will have more active in 2025, but that's going to come on, frankly, the -- who knows, the curve could change. But based on the curve that we see today, that's going to come on and actually be less of a headwind each quarter into 2025. Our received fixed rate, you asked, Erika, is around 3.40% on that notional."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire; our Vice-Chair and Chief Risk Officer, Clarke Starnes, as well as other members of Truist's senior management team. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's second quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions, and provide an updated outlook for 2024. The accompanying presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I will now turn it over to Bill.\nWilliam Rogers: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. So before we discuss our second-quarter results, let's begin with purpose on Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Purpose is the foundation for things that we do. We believe purpose and performance are inextricably late. I'd like to share some of the ways we brought our purpose to life last quarter. During the quarter, Truist Securities advised and served as an active joint book-runner for Oglethorpe Power's inaugural $350 million green bond, which will be used to support their investment in Plant Vogtle, the largest producer of clean energy in the United States. The company is committed to reducing GHG emissions while delivering cost-effective and reliable clean energy with a diverse energy portfolio. This transaction represents only the second green-labeled bond in the US where the use of proceeds are allocated to nuclear energy. We also launched a new financial education program tailored specifically for high-school and college students called Truist Life, Money, and Choices. This initiative is aimed at empowering younger generations with financial lessons and essential skills to navigate their financial futures. These are just a couple of examples of how we brought our purpose to life during the quarter. I'm very proud of the meaningful work we're doing across our businesses to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients, our teammates, our communities, and of course, our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. So let's turn to our key takeaways on Slide 6. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share, which excludes the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings, the loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities, a charitable donation to the Truist Foundation, and a few smaller items that Mike will discuss in further detail in the call. In addition, pre-tax restructuring charges of $96 million, which were primarily related to the sale of TIH and severance, and also negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.05 per share. So looking through a few discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we grew adjusted revenue 3% on a linked quarter basis, which was driven by 4.5% growth of net interest income due primarily to the balance sheet reposition we completed during the quarter. Second, our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost. As a result of these efforts, adjusted expenses increased by 2.6% linked quarter and decreased by 3% on a year-over-year basis. We are fully committed to delivering our objective of keeping expenses flat in 2024 versus last year. We're also pleased that non-performing loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter and that net charge-offs were within our expectations. During the quarter, we also completed the sale of our remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which significantly strengthened our relative capital position and create substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses. In recognition of the incredibly long-term positive impact of our insurance business, we utilized a portion of the gain to make a $150 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation to further our purpose-driven work across our banking footprint for years to come. Simultaneously, with the closing of TIH, we repositioned a portion of our available-for-sale investment portfolio, which along with the proceeds received from the sale of TIH, is expected to provide an offset to TIH earnings contribution. Mike will provide more details on these transactions later in the call. In late June, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through the end of 2026. We plan to begin repurchasing our shares during the third quarter and we'll initially target share repurchases of approximately $500 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Finally, we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core consumer and wholesale banking businesses. Although, overall loan demand remained slow during the quarter, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company, which I'm going to discuss a little later in the call. So before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the financial performance in more detail, let me provide a quick update on the progress we're making in improving experiences for our clients on Slide 7. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew 7% and the digital transactions increased 13% compared to the second quarter of last year. Transactions continue to shift towards self-service capabilities, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions, which are up 39% year-over-year. In addition, we added over 180,000 new accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new to bank clients through our digital channels, which represents a 17% increase over the second quarter 2023. Importantly, digital checking account production among Gen Z and millennial clients was higher by 42% on a year-over-year basis. A new more modernized small-business digital onboarding experience has also resulted in new high in application completion rates, while we're also seeing increased digital engagement with our small-business clients. We've also made enhancements to enterprise platforms that have empowered teammates to deliver knowledge and care through 1.8 million caring conversations, resulting in 1.4 million accepted recommendations for Great Truist products and services. These enhanced offerings, coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher consumer digital client satisfaction scores as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our T3 Strategy. Overall, I'm really proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital engagement. So with that, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results in more detail. Mike?\nMike Maguire: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin discussing our second quarter results, I'd like to spend a few moments recapping the strategic actions that significantly impacted our second quarter results. First, on May 6, we completed the divestiture of our remaining ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings at an implied value of $15.5 billion. At closing, we received after-cash or after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $10.1 billion and recorded an after-tax gain of $4.8 billion. The sale of TIH created $9.5 billion of capital, which generated 230 basis points of CET1 under current capital rules and 250 basis -- 254 basis points of capital under proposed fully phased in Basel III rules. Our tangible book value per share also increased by 33%. On the same day, we executed a strategic balance sheet repositioning of a portion of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. We sold approximately $27.7 billion of market value, lower-yielding investment securities, which resulted in an after-tax loss of $5.1 billion. The investment securities that we sold had a book value of $34.4 billion and a weighted average book yield of 2.80% for the remainder of 2024, including the impact of hedges and based on the federal funds curve at that time. Including the tax benefit, the sale of investment securities generated $29.3 billion of proceeds available for reinvestment. When coupled with the proceeds from the sale of TIH, there were $39.4 billion of proceeds available for reinvestment. Of that, we invested approximately $18.7 billion in Investment Securities yielding 5.27%, with the remaining $20.7 billion held in cash. At the time we invested the proceeds, the blended reinvestment rate on the new investment securities purchased and the cash was 5.22% for the remainder of 2024, including the impact of hedges. As Bill mentioned, the reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter are expected to replace TIH's earnings contributions. These actions completed during the second quarter significantly accelerate our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry and importantly, create capacity for Truist to grow its core banking franchise and to return capital to shareholders via our strong dividend and share repurchases. Now turning to our second-quarter key performance highlights on Slide 9. We reported second quarter 2024 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $826 million or $0.62 per share. This included a net loss of $4 billion from continuing operations or $2.98 per share and net income from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or $3.60 per share. The net loss available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $4 billion or $2.98 per share was impacted by the following items: a $6.7 billion pre-tax or $3.80 per share after-tax loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities; a $150 million pre-tax or $0.09 per share charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation, a $13 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after tax expense related to FDIC special assessment adjustment. Net income available to common shareholders from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or $3.60 per share was impacted by the following items: a $6.9 billion pre-tax or $3.60 per share after-tax gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings; a $10 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after-tax expense due to the accelerated recognition of TIH equity-based compensation. So, on an adjusted basis we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $96 million in the quarter, which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.05 per share. Approximately $33 million of these pre-tax charges or $0.02 per share after tax negatively impacted net income from continuing operations and were primarily related to severance and real estate rationalization. The remaining restructuring charges were recorded in discontinued operations and were related to legal and other expenses associated with closing the divestiture of TIH. Total revenue adjusted for the losses on the available-for-sale investment securities increased 3% linked quarter due to a 4.5% increase in net interest income and relatively stable non-interest income. Adjusted expenses increased 2.6% linked quarter, but were down approximately 3% on a like quarter basis. Our CET1 ratio increased by 150 basis points linked quarter to 11.6%, primarily reflecting the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning I discussed earlier. In addition, net charge-offs declined 6 basis points on a linked quarter basis and our non-performing loans remained relatively stable, both on a like and linked quarter basis. Moving to Slide 10. Average loans decreased 0.7% on a sequential basis, reflecting overall weaker client demand. Average commercial loans decreased $1.3 billion or 0.7%, primarily due to a 0.8% decline in C&I balances, driven at least in part by capital markets activity. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased $1 billion or 0.9% due to runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio and a decline in indirect auto. Other consumer balances, which include our specialty lending units, experienced modest growth and benefited from seasonal strength at Sheffield and increased demand at Service Finance. Overall, we expect client loan demand to remain relatively muted in the third quarter. Moving to deposit trends on Slide 11. Average deposits decreased 0.3% sequentially as growth in money market and savings was offset by declines in non-interest bearing time and brokered balances. Average non-interest bearing deposits decreased 1.2% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged compared to 28% during the first quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we experienced an increase in deposit costs, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter. Specifically, total deposit costs increased 6 basis points sequentially, 2.09%, which resulted in a 1% increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 39%. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 7 basis points sequentially to 2.89%, which also resulted in a 1% increase to our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta cost, up 54%. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 12. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income increased 4.5% linked quarter or $155 million, primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this repositioning, our net interest income would have been relatively stable on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to our focus on average client deposits, which declined less than we expected. Reported net interest margin increased 14 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.03%. This was due primarily to the impact of the balance sheet repositioning. The partial quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning helped to drive a 31 basis point improvement in the average yield on our investment securities portfolio to 2.77%. We estimate that our balance sheet remains positioned as relatively neutral from an interest-rate perspective comparable to Q1. Turning to non-interest income on Slide 13. Adjusted non-interest income, which excludes the losses associated with the balance sheet repositioning decreased $8 million or 0.6% relative to the first quarter. The linked quarter decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment banking and trading income, which declined $37 million from our strong first quarter performance due to lower M&A fees, equity originations, and trading income, partially offset by higher loan syndication fees. This decline was partially offset by higher mortgage banking and other income. Adjusted non-interest income increased 4.2% on a like-quarter basis as higher investment banking and trading and wealth management income were partially offset by lower service charge on deposit and other income. On a year-to-date basis, investment banking and trading income is up nearly 30% over the same period in 2023. Now, I'll cover non-interest expense on Slide 14. GAAP expenses of $3.1 billion increased $141 million linked quarter, primarily due to higher other expense-related to $150 million charitable donation, higher personnel costs reflecting merit increases, and higher professional fees. These increases were offset by lower restructuring charges and a reduction in FDIC expense due to a larger special assessment recorded in the first quarter. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.6% sequentially due to higher personnel expense and professional fees. On a like-quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined $86 million or 3%, reflecting lower headcount and our continued expense discipline. Moving to Asset Quality on Slide 15. Asset Quality remained stable on both a like and linked quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio decreased 6 basis points to 58 basis points. The decrease in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects lower consumer losses due to normal second quarter seasonal declines and certain derisking initiatives put in place in the second half of 2022. Our loan loss provision declined $49 million linked quarter, reflecting our stable credit performance, but it still exceeded net charge-offs for the quarter, resulting in a slight build to our overall loan loss allowance. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.57%, up 1 basis point sequentially and 14 basis points year-over-year, which reflects ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector. Despite the normalization, non-performing loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter, while total delinquencies increased just 2 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Wholesale criticized loans declined $1 billion linked quarter to $10.8 billion. Included in our appendix is an updated -- is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.6% of total loans. However, we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 9.3% to 9.7% during the quarter to reflect continued stress in the sector. Approximately 6.3% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing compared with 5.5% at March 31st. Approximately, 90% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. Notably, approximately 22% of our office portfolio is housed within our Community Banking and Wealth segments, where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent, and overall loss is lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well-reserved, but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio. Turning now to capital on Slide 16. Truist CET1 ratio increased from 10.1% at March 31st to 11.6% at June 30. The increase was driven by the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and organic capital generation, which was partially offset by the loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities during the quarter, which I addressed earlier. Importantly, the sale of TIH creates capacity for Truist to pursue growth opportunities in our Consumer and Wholesale Banking businesses and to return significant capital to shareholders, as evidenced by our share buyback program. Truist is well-positioned to weather a wide variety of economic scenarios, which was evident in our most recent CCAR stress-test results released in late June. Specifically, Truist had the second-lowest C&I loan loss rate and the third-lowest CET1 erosion rate versus our peers. Our stress capital buffer will improve by 10 basis points to 2.8%, effective October 1st. At June 30, our CET1 ratio was 430 basis points higher than our new regulatory minimum of 7.3%, leaving us well-positioned to both grow our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. Our increased level of capital accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry as our estimated CET1 capital ratio under proposed Basel III endgame rules improved 20 basis points to 9.1% at June 30, which is 180 basis points above our new regulatory minimum. And now, I will review updated guidance -- our updated guidance on Slide 17. Looking into the third quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to increase 1% to 2% from second quarter 2024 adjusted revenue of $5 billion. We expect net interest income to increase 2% to 3% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a full quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning completed on May 6. We expect non-interest income to remain relatively stable on a linked quarter basis. Adjusted expenses of $2.8 billion in the second quarter are expected to increase by 3% in the third quarter due to higher professional fees, software costs, and higher marketing costs. For the full year 2024, we previously expected revenues to be down 0.5% to 1.5%. We now expect total revenues to decline by approximately 0.5% to 1% in 2024. Our updated outlook is based on slightly better client deposit balance performance, partially offset by lower client loan demand and our updated view of interest rates, which now assumes just one reduction in the Federal Funds rate in November of this year. Consistent with our previous expense outlook, we expect full year 2024 adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over 2023 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion. In terms of Asset Quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024. As Bill previously mentioned, we are targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases per quarter for the remainder of the year as part of our share repurchase authorization announced in late June. Finally, we expect our effective tax-rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a taxable equivalent basis in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Now, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\nWilliam Rogers: Great. Thanks, Mike. So our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged. They include growing and deepening relationships with core clients, maintaining our expense discipline, returning capital to our shareholders via share buybacks and our common strong dividend, and enhancing our digital experience through T3, all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. We made demonstrable progress on these priorities during the quarter, and I'm really proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum, and sound asset quality. All this was accomplished while also completing the divestiture of Truist Insurance Holdings and repositioning our balance sheet during the quarter. These actions created significant capital capacity to grow our Consumer and Wholesale businesses and return capital to shareholders via our strong common dividend and our recently announced repurchase authorization of up to $5 billion of our common stock. In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet is well-positioned to weather an even wider range of economic and interest-rate environments. Although the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter is expected to replace TIH's earnings in the near term, we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. As I've said previously, our starting point for our ROTCE is exactly that, it's a starting point. We're going to move with pace to deploy our capital, improve our returns, but we're not going to be in a rush to leverage capital to meet short-term expectations that do not have long term positive impact on our company, clients, and shareholders. We have a clear understanding of not only where we want to win, but where we want to win profitably. We'll look to share more of our plan with you as we progress through the remainder of this year. I can say that I'm encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential we are working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships in verticals and product lines that already exist at Truist. We have great confidence in our ability to further penetrate our existing client base, grow our core banking business, and help new and existing clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer, payments, investment banking, and wealth platform, given the ongoing investments through our existing footprint in specialty areas. In wholesale, we've invested in our investment banking and trading platform over the last several years. We've also hired experienced bankers in key industry verticals and products. These investments have resulted in greater mind share with our clients across many industry verticals and an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines. Most recently, we've invested heavily in our Payments business and have made key leadership additions as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time, not only with new clients, but also within our existing client base. We have a clear focus, high expectations, and a compelling teammate value proposition. Many of our teammates have risen to this new challenge and we have very successfully hired additional strong talent in wholesale, primarily from larger institutions who have experience and are thriving in our purpose-driven high-performance culture. We plan to continue adding talent in wholesale with a specific focus on further building out our middle-market commercial lending segment, which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional business. We will primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise. We're making these investments, while also adhering to our expense discipline, which is helping fund investments in technology to improve the client experience and also to improve risk management. In consumer, I'm really encouraged with our momentum. Our internal client satisfaction scores continue to improve as evidenced by increased net-new checking account production, increased primacy, and lower attrition rates. Net-new checking account production was once again positive in the second quarter as we added 38,000 new consumer and business accounts. Importantly, we're also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates and increased primacy and usage within new account openings. As I previously mentioned, we added 180,000 new accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new to bank clients through our digital channels, which represented a 17% increase. In addition to an increase in account openings, we're also seeing improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up 60% over the second quarter of last year. In consumer and small business lending, we've been consistently adding new small business lenders across our footprint. In the second quarter, small business applications increased 15% linked quarter, resulting in a 10% increase in our pipeline given us confidence that average consumer balance says excluding runoff in residential mortgages will stabilize in the third quarter. In conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we've made as a company at the midpoint of this year, but we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future. We have tremendous momentum within our company. We have momentum with our clients and we've got great momentum with our teammates. We have an incredible franchise, energized, purposeful teammates, and specialized capabilities that our clients value. We think the ability to grow our core banking business, our profitability, and return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years is a unique differentiating factor for Truist. I am optimistic about our future. I look-forward to operating our company from our increased position of financial strength. And finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank all of our incredible teammates and our great leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity and moving our company forward. So Brad, with that, let me hand it over back over to you for Q&A.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike.\nWilliam Rogers: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: And maybe to start off with NII, it feels post-restructuring, we've bottomed now and you should get a step up next quarter, but can you maybe just talk about the drivers of sequential NII growth over the next few quarters? Do you expect margin improvement? And then how do you think about where the margin could be headed over the medium-term? Thanks. And I have a follow-up\nMike Maguire: Hey, good morning, Ryan. We mentioned in our comments that we do expect the NII to improve next quarter by 2% to 3%, really, the bulk of that is driven by just the full quarter impact of the repositioning that we completed back in May. We continue to expect there to be some pressure on client deposit balances as well as loan balances, so maybe a touch conservative there. We did have some nice, just to say it, just some nice outperformance in the second quarter on client deposit balances, which really helped stabilize that core NII ex the bonds. But that's really sort of the story for Q2. And I think Q4, just looking out a little further, if you think about kind of rest of year trajectory, kind of more of the same, right? I mean, we mentioned we've got a November cut in. We think that helps a touch, but that is the first cut and it's pretty late. So we've got pretty modest expectations around the impact there. And I think for us, really what will stimulate some improvement on the NII side will just be some of the core balances. So getting client loan demand increased, getting -- which hopefully will generate balances as well, and I'll just mention this, I mean we're very focused around the company, pick your segment or [LOB] (ph), everybody in the company is very focused on realizing that growth opportunity once it presents itself. It's just -- and you've heard this from I think others this week and last week, there just has really not been a lot of client activity.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Maybe this one for Mike or Bill. As a follow-up to Mike's comments. So it looks like loan balances are getting closer to level-off, but Mike, you highlighted 3Q, you're expecting it to be muted and my interpretation was that it doesn't sound like you're expecting a lot of growth in the fourth quarter. So maybe just flush those expectations a little further, Bill, when do you expect it to turn positive? What do you think the drivers are? And I guess, given the strength of your footprint, do you actually expect Truist to begin to outperform peers on growth at some point? Thank you.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes, let me -- I'll start with the second part of that first and the answer to that is yes. But it has to have growth. We've got to sort of see that coming. Clients are on the sidelines, I mean, we can feel that in our conversations. Our conversations are increasingly a lot more strategic. So I feel like we actually even know more about what our clients are thinking, but they're a bit on the sidelines. Our production was up, so we saw production being up. It was really probably best in consumer, where it was up a little more significantly. Utilization is just absolutely flat but paydowns were also up. So in our clients that aren't towards the larger side, they were accessing the capital markets, and the good news is, I mean, you see that in our investment banking, particularly in our DCM results, I mean we're -- our capture rate on that is really, really high, so we sort of see the other part of that. Despite the pipelines being up, production being up, I just want to be careful, Ryan, about sort of like putting a stake in the ground and saying, okay, it's going to return on ex. I mean, take this weekend, I mean there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world and in the market. So while clients have capacity, we're coiled spring, ready to go, positioned better than anybody. I think we just want to be realistic about when and if that -- well, not if, but when that's going to come back and when it's going to come back with some strength. And when it does, I think to your latter part of your question, we're in the best markets and I think we should disproportionately grow faster.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for all the color, Bill.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. I guess as a follow-up to that line of thought, Bill, you mentioned that you'd be methodical and kind of not getting ahead of yourself to just use near-term. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of just remind us again, now that we've got the buyback out there, now that the restructuring is done, you just gave more color on the loan growth, talk about prioritization, what would lead you to do kind of one more than the other in terms of moving the ball of all things excess capital-related and then how that kind of leads into your pacing choices on the buyback specifically? Thanks.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes, Ken, great question. And obviously, something that's important and we're going to be calibrating, priority one, two, and three is growing our business. I mean, we think we've got a great franchise, a great market. We're really well-positioned. We've invested in talent, we've invested in capabilities, so I think we've got the capacity and the capability to grow in our core business. So that is absolutely going to be the primary focus. We raised capital in the most efficient way possible. You just couldn't have raised it more efficiently than how we raised capital and we want to make sure that we deploy that also in the most efficient way possible long-term, long-term benefit for our shareholders. So I think we've put together a compelling return perspective with what Mike outlined. We're going to do about $500 million a quarter for the next couple of quarters, I would presume we'd enter next year in sort of the same kind of -- same kind of pace, but remember, that's also on top of we've got a really strong dividend. So in terms of total dollars returned to shareholders over the next six months, I mean, we have a really compelling value proposition. So we're going to calibrate that as we go along. We don't want to over-index on one and lose this incredible capital advantage we have for growth.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Got it. And then secondly, as you enjoy this incremental NII benefit, it does seem like in the second half, certainly in the third quarter, expenses look to be increasing, can you give us also a little bit of context in terms of how you're calibrating the new better revenue outlook to making those investments and the pacing just flattish -- flat is a tough like overall guide to see through, but kind of at flat, it implies that third quarter and in fourth quarter expenses are still -- are going higher, just wondering if you could provide a little context underneath that about your pacing of your investment spending and to the areas you mentioned earlier. Thanks.\nMike Maguire: Hey, Ken, it's Mike. Maybe take a swing at that one. No, you're right. I mean, look, we think we do see growth in the third quarter on the expense side, I think that's still on a like basis, close to flat, maybe even a touch better, and I think that implies, if you think about flat, maybe a touch of growth in the fourth as well. Look, I mean, the first half of the year, we were very focused on cost discipline and frankly following through on our commitment around flat. That's still important to us. But as we've sort of gotten to the midway mark, it's -- there have been certain projects, whether it be some marketing spend sort of you name it, nits and nats that perhaps were delayed and that drove some of the beat maybe even this quarter and even in last quarter, and so some of that stuff just makes a ton of sense. And as we really shift our mindset, and you heard Bill talk a little bit about it in his prepared remarks around some of the hiring we're doing in middle-market lending as an example, around our Payments business, some calibrating of marketing spend, et cetera, these are all factors that are driving our outlook for the second half, and so, look, we feel -- and we've said this is really since last fall, we are very, very confident and committed to being sort of 0.0 or better on expenses this year.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes, and Ken, just to add to that, I mean, when we undertook this approach in the fall of last year, I mean, we were always really clear this was going to include investments and the timing of those sort of, as Mike pointed out, come quarter-to-quarter. And we're seeing the benefit of that. I mean, the investments we made in payments, investment made in talent, so the expense guidance was always coincident with that. I'll just say because I think it's really important, the discipline that we have in the company around both of those is significantly increased. So we sort of know that the next dollar to invest with a lot of confidence and we also have just incredibly strong discipline around the expense side and where the opportunities are. So I think we've got the right balance here. And as Mike said, wholly committed to a flat or better expense proposition for the remainder of this year.\nKen Usdin: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I know you suggested you all are relatively neutral to rate moves. I think still kind of for better or worse, a lot of investors consider Truist is among the -- kind of closer to the liability-sensitive side of the equation. In that vein, you anticipate just one rate cut in the remainder of the year, how would another one or two affect that NII guidance? Obviously, timing would be a factor, but just curious on your overall thoughts.\nMike Maguire: Yes, good morning, Scott. Yes, so we do have the one cut in November. If we got one earlier, call it, I think the curve today has a September cut and maybe December and maybe even a touch more than that, that would be a help for us. We -- look, we -- our baseline path does show benefit from down rates. I think the question and I brought it up in sort of my earlier question, I think that Ryan asked, that first cut given how high we are and how late we expected, we're just trying to be reasonable and thinking about the benefit we'll get there. But I think you're right, I think if we got one earlier and then maybe perhaps a second, that would be a good guy. I will say this, I think just given where we are in terms of how high we are and how long we've been here and some of the client behavior that we're able to observe, I think the more impactful catalyst will be, again, getting some of that loan demand and balanced growth and client deposit growth as well. So would take it all.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears just a second, I was hoping you might be able to address the investment banking line, down a little in the quarter, but I'd say, you at least -- I see you're still well above a recent run rate, so still a very strong number. Maybe if you could touch to or speak to sort of overall thoughts on the outlook and then maybe a thought on what you might consider sort of a sustainable base of revenues for you all.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes, I mean we're -- the Investment Banking business is always going to be a little quarter-to-quarter variation. In the first quarter, we had one of the highest M&A fees in our company's history, so that sort of changed -- impacted that a bit. But most importantly, we feel really good about the momentum. So if you look at sort of our relevance, I mean, we're gaining share in virtually every category, the things that we're doing in terms of active book-runner and left lead transactions in ECM, half of our fees were being from active book-runner, dramatic change from where we've been in the past, lots of left leads transactions in there and again increased market share. And most importantly, just really good relevance. So back to sort of the comment about talent and comment about adding talent and upgrading our toolkits, our commercial bankers' focus and understanding and -- of our capabilities is just increasing exponentially. So our dialogue, as I mentioned with our clients is really strong. It's all strategic dialogue versus product dialogue, which is really good. And I think for the balance of the year, I mean, I think this is the kind of momentum we ought to be able to continue investment banking, so I think we feel good about that.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. All right. Bill, Mike, thank you, guys, very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. Just putting everything that you said together, Mike, maybe I'll address this one to you. Your net interest income was better than consensus, both mostly on the net interest margin. You mentioned that the impact of the margin from balance sheet restructuring is a partial one. If I look at the line items on non-interest income, you also be consensus there for the quarter in terms of the core items and consensus is at down, one, which is at the low end of your revenue range. I guess, like what are we missing? And I heard your response to Ryan's question about you expect balances to continue to come down in both the loan on deposit side, but if your starting point on net interest margin is higher than consensus and then you have a little bit more pull-through -- a month pull-through in the third quarter and your neutral to rates in September will help, I guess, are you being very conservative on what you could accomplish in the second half of the year because I get the conservatism from a business standpoint, but from a rate standpoint, it feels like you guys are in good shape to maybe do a little bit better.\nMike Maguire: Yes, Erika, I appreciate the question. I mean -- look, I think there was a beat on balances in the second quarter, especially if you look at it on an average basis, and so our rate paid was a touch better than we thought, and so you're right, starting position better than where we sort of would have expected to be in April. I think the pressures that we expected in the second quarter, we still believe will persist in the third, especially in terms of balances and rate paid. Another piece of this is that while we did get some benefit on our net interest margin from the bonds like recouponing, some of the benefit as well is just on a smaller balance sheet. So we did -- for example, we paid down some wholesale liabilities late in the second that will come through in the third on an average basis. So you'll see more net interest margin improvement, but it will be on a more efficient smaller balance sheet. On rates, I don't want to call the ball on conservative -- non-conservative, I think we're cautious on what benefit we'll get on the first cut or two. We've thought about it a lot, done a lot of work and analysis. You look at sort of historically, over the last, call it, 30 years, the down cycles and the betas have been slow, right? So I think that's in our thinking too for the rest of the year. And look, I've said this a couple of times. I think for us, the thing -- we're like feel fine about the guidance we gave, I think what would really be upside for us would be a little bit of pull-through on more client activity and the ability to generate more loan volume and with that will come deposits. You get that and maybe you get Scott's extra cut in early and that feels good. I mean the hurts are obviously the cut we've got, no cuts perhaps, maybe that's not such a bad guy, and then just the pressure that we've been seeing on balances, both deposits and loans.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my second question is for Bill on capital and returns. And maybe I'm just reading too much in the tea leaves because investors are very curious. The authorization for the $5 billion is through 2026. You said during your prepared remarks, tell me if I'm being too ticky-tacky, but you said initially target $5 billion for the remainder of the year, and I guess investors are wondering about timing and I know someone had already asked, Ken has already asked about capital priorities, but is this -- what's the timing in terms of that fulfilling that $5 billion authority? And as I think about returns, I know you'll probably tell us more during fall conference season, but initially, this franchise together with TIH had an ROTCE potential in the low 20s, with TIH out, could you still achieve like a high-teens ROTCE? And I'm sure you will get more details during fall conference season.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes, Erika, just to correct one thing, we said some of a billion through the remainder of this year and we'll sort of start the next year, and the reason to put the authorization of up to and make it through 2026 is just to give us that kind of flexibility in terms of how we think about that. So we're going to calibrate that against our growth opportunities and where we see an ability to invest in our franchise and we're going to be disciplined about it. So -- and then as I mentioned earlier, remember, this is with a really strong dividend as well. So I think you can't talk about one without talking about the other in terms of total return to shareholders. So I think our unique capability to have a really good return to shareholders over the certainly near-term and medium-term from the dividend buyback is actually quite significant. And then you put on top of that our ability to earn and earn profitably and grow our business. So I think that's -- we're trying to look at all of this in the big mix. As it relates to ROTCE specifically, I mean the past numbers are the past numbers, we sort of have to start from the business model that we have now. Again, we're going to give a little more guidance on that with a little more specificity as we get towards the end of the year, as you mentioned. I think we'll have a little more knowledge as to sort of overall capital requirements. And while Basel may not be complete, I think we might have a better picture of where we might be and what the sort of CET1 base might be that we'd operate from and think about how to put all those mixes together as it relates to growth as well. So irrespective of the target itself, the growth to the target, I think is a really compelling proposition for Truist.\nErika Najarian: Okay, Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nMike Maguire: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: A bit of a follow-up on last question with Erika regarding capital, when I put together the $500 million that you're looking for in the buybacks and the dividend, it looks like you're -- for the most part returning earnings -- quarterly earnings to investors at least for the rest of this year and RWA doesn't change, that means you've got a CET1 stable where it is today. I know you're probably not -- you didn't put a target CET1 out. I'm going to guess you're going to highlight that we need the capital rules to put that out there. But is that a fair conclusion that 11.6% is essentially what we should anticipate as we roll through the rest of this year?\nMike Maguire: Yes, Betsy, I think that's roughed out, you could see us sort of sliding sideways for a while for the reasons you mentioned, you're right. I mean you take the $500 million buyback and, call it, $700 million or so dividend, you're approximately at -- this is rough earnings, right? And I think you're right, we don't expect significant ROA improvement or decline over the period. I'll just say this, I mean -- and you mentioned sort of CET1 target, Bill referred to it as well, I think a couple of things just to think about there. One, we like operating with a higher level of capital in today's world, one. It affords us the right, we think strength and resiliency and ability to sort of react to the world. Importantly, we've got a growth agenda. We're focused on prosecuting that's company-wide. You feel that with any -- especially frontline, but really across the whole company, and then Bill mentioned sort of the capability to return capital and that can come in various forms. But yes, I think modeling us somewhat flat short-term. But again, we -- our expectation is that we'll begin to grow RWAs next year and so that's how we're thinking about it.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. And then on the pay downs that you experienced in the C&I book, how much of that did you capture in the Capital Markets business? In other words, if folks are terming out and paying down C&I, is that -- are we seeing a majority recaptured in the fee line? Thanks.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes. It's hard to do that calculation sort of perfectly and we spend a lot of time thinking about it, but if you sort of look at the overall line, this was one of our best DCM quarters in a really long time. So our capture rate is really high. It's hard to put an exact percentage on that because there are puts and takes, and would you have got it otherwise and was it related to this, that, or the other? But it's really high and it's reflected in our overall DCM growth.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. What it seems like could just touch on credit a little bit. I know you added modestly to the loan loss reserve and looks like much of that was on the office side. I wanted to get your thoughts there in terms of the -- what you're seeing right now in terms of credit progression. What are the areas that you're seeing some weakening? You had some pressure on delinquencies and non-accruals? And could that justify incremental modest additions to the reserve from here, or could you see it stable or even some releases from this point? Thanks.\nClarke Starnes: Hey, John, this is Clarke. As Mike and Bill said, we were very pleased with the overall asset quality for the quarter and we generally had stable delinquencies. We had flat NPLs and our losses were a touch lower, particularly in this consumer area. So we still see in the consumer side, the normalization that's occurring due to higher rates, inflation, and the stimulus burndown, particularly for the lower end consumer. So we've been a little careful there even in this quarter's reserve. We added a little bit for those lower income consumer finance areas. And then you're right, on the CRE side and the office exposure, we still just want to make sure we're addressing the uncertainty there. On the wholesale C&I side, we actually had, as Bill said, lower watch list, and even though we're monitoring areas like the leverage book, consumer discretionary, senior care, transportation, some of those more rate-sensitive areas, we've not had any big sector issues to date, it's been more episodic. So when we think about our reserves, we feel really good about the adequacy of where we are today and it reflects what we know today. So unless there's a substantial change in the economic outlook or that level of uncertainty in areas of stress like CRE office would emerge higher, we wouldn't expect our reserve levels for the remainder of 2024 to be relatively stable.\nJohn Pancari: Okay, great. Thanks for that clarity. And then separately on the on the fee side, just -- I know you mentioned relatively stable in terms of the non-interest income outlook for the third quarter, maybe can you talk about fourth quarter a little bit, how we should think about the progression into fourth quarter and into 2025? And then separately, as part of that, on the investment banking side, you made some pretty solid talent acquisition and you've cited the intent that you're investing there and the progress you've made, can you maybe just talk to us about, is the build-out ongoing? Is there a focused effort to upscale the investment banking business even more in terms of the reach and breadth of the business and maybe what are the long-term revenue contribution from that business that you anticipate?\nWilliam Rogers: Yes, maybe I'll start with the latter, Mike, and then I'll turn it over to you for the performance if that's okay. So the build-out of Investment Banking business has been decades plus, so this isn't sort of a new thing, and so it has been consistent. I think the way you described it is exactly right. We'll continue to build where we have relevance, where we have opportunity, and so we can be competitive and win in our markets. I think the part that gets missed though is the investment we're making around the Investment Banking business. So this is the investment that we're making with our commercial teams and our middle-market teams and expanding their knowledge and capability to talk to clients about the things that are available to them. And so think about the amount of clients in our commercial business that are now private equity-owned and our capability to be relevant in those discussions and help them along that flight path. So investment is not just in the business itself, but it's in everything that surrounds the business and in support of. We like the pace that we're growing and we think we've had a really good CAGR. If you sort of go back over time and look at the CAGR of that business, you'd sort of say that's a really good growth pattern. Importantly, we're doing it profitably, which is also important. So we have a really good efficiency of that business certainly on a on a relative basis, and we want to keep all of those in check. I mean, we don't want to grow faster than the market. We want to grow coincident with the opportunity that we have within our markets. We want to do it profitably and we want to do it sustainably. So we want to have a little less variability relative to that business. So it's tied to more of our core client capability than the vagaries of a particular market. And Mike, there was a...\nMike Maguire: Yes, John, I think you asked just about the trajectory for the second half for fees, I think some -- you don't know to -- put some puts and takes, our outlook is relatively stable really for the second half, so call it, stable, stable.\nWilliam Rogers: And the upside to that is [Multiple Speakers] Yes, maybe upside is business is better. We're trying to take an approach with what we know right now.\nJohn Pancari: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hey, not a new question, but it goes back to your efficiency ratio and your expense guide and you mentioned higher in the third quarter, and maybe any preview for next year or how you're thinking about that? And that's partly in the context, there's a Bloomberg story out saying that 11 of the 22 large banks fall short on operational risk according to the OCC. Now that's not confirmed by the OCC. There's no specific companies given and I know you're not allowed to say what your regulatory ratings are, but if you or any other bank did have a deficient operational risk rating, what would that mean? Would it mean -- I don't know what would that mean? Are you able to say if you had ever been in that position in the past five years? I know you had some operational issues that you work through. And then also note, Bill, that your purpose is being open every day for your clients and employees and your communities, so I know you put that as a very high priority. So what degree has that hurt the efficiency in the past few years and to what degree could that still be a drag on efficiency going ahead? Thanks.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes, Mike, you asked and answered part of your question as it relates to what will comment on and not comment on. But look, I've said very consistently actually since the day Truist was formed, is the size and complexity of our organization, we're going to invest in our risk framework. We're going to invest in a durable risk framework, so we can stay competitive, we can stay appropriate with our regulators and that's always been part of this expense profile. So I think even in today's prepared remarks, I mean, I'm always consistent with that, and I think everybody has got to stay in that mode. Post of March of last year, irrespective of anybody's ratings, there was just increased focus on creating a durable risk profile. So we're going to continue to be in that mode. I can't see that changing short-term, medium-term, or long-term. Are there peaks and valleys in that as you go up? Yes, does it increase proportionately? Absolutely. I mean, I just think that's the price of being in our business and also the importance of creating a durable sustainable risk framework for a company of our size and the company of our opportunity.\nMike Mayo: Well, the $20 billion market cap question relates to the last part of your answer is for a company of our size, so I'm just wondering, and it's an ongoing wonder, to what degree does that investment in the risk framework hurt Truist disproportionately versus banks larger than your size and how has that changed?\nWilliam Rogers: Yes. I mean there are efficient frontiers is the way, Mike, that I like to talk about it. They're efficient frontiers and where you are on the efficient frontier relative to that. But today, I feel like we're in a good place. So we're in a good place in terms of the investments that we need and should make relative to our company our size and our ability to return and have an efficient company relative to that. So I think we're at a good place. But that efficient frontier moves, so you always have to be flexible and think about that in the context of where it moves and we're conscious of that. So today, I feel like we're in a good place. By the way, we merged our companies because we thought we were at a different place and that that was going to be more complex and we needed to have a company of the size and scale sort of seeing -- I mean, we didn't project March of last year in fairness, but understanding that the complexity and the durability and the investments needed to create that kind of risk platform was going to be needed. So that efficient frontier, I think we're in a good place on it, but it does move.\nMike Mayo: And Last short follow-up. The definition of good place as it relates to 2025, I know you usually don't give guidance for a few quarters from now, but other banks have mentioned record NII, positive operating leverage, lower expenses next year, can you give us a sneak peak of good place as it relates to 2025 financials?\nWilliam Rogers: Yes. I mean our sneak peek is the momentum we're creating right now. So that's the sneak peek and we want to continue to do that. Mike, you and I've talked about this. I mean, we have a strong focus on positive operating leverage. So all of our businesses have plans that are focused on positive operating leverage, that's what they try to build over time. The controllable -- more controllable factor over that is on the expense side right now, and I'm really pleased with the progress we're making. And I expect to continue to have that kind of discipline going forward. Those expenses will better reflect the revenue opportunity that we see in next year. So be assured that we've got to focus on creating that, but also be confident that we're building momentum. And I think this quarter is good evidence of that and our guidance for the rest of the year is good evidence of that.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. Just a quick follow-up, Bill, on your response to Mike's question. As we think about -- I just want to make sure we understand this correctly, as we think about next year, ex any sort of revenue momentum taking sort of the top line higher, should we expect expenses like the Street is expecting about $2.9 billion to $3 billion per quarter in expense run-rate continuing in 2025? Is that fair to assume all else equal, absent sort of revenue growth?\nWilliam Rogers: Yes, thanks. I'm not going to give expense guidance for next year. Just to say, confidence that we'll be focused on positive operating leverage, confidence that we've got great expense discipline, and expenses will more parallel the revenue opportunity. So if we see the investments that we're making, better growth opportunities in our markets, we're going to take advantage of that. And if that requires a requisite -- expense increase, then we'll do that, but that will all be in the appropriate context of focus on positive operating leverage, an efficient company that has high returns.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just one quick follow-up, maybe if you could remind us post sort of the acquisition integration where we stand in terms of any big tech upgrades coming on the deposit or lending platforms as we think about the next year or two? Thanks.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes. I mean, all that's been factored into the discussions that we have. I mean, our ability -- this year, particularly to invest a lot in the payment side, is all predicated on the existing platforms that we have. The advent of the use of APIs have been really, really great opportunities to continue to invest. We had huge investments in our lending portfolios as part of the merger. So there's no like one big stair step sequenced investment, these are continuous investments in our platform and capabilities over time.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And is it safe to assume that from a tech platform standpoint, Truist is not at a disadvantage relative to peers who probably have not done deals and just been working on -- there's an impression out there that you have a lot more sort of heavy-lifting to do there that's put you back, sounds like that's not the case, but just wanted to confirm.\nWilliam Rogers: Well, the momentum we've seen in the last several quarters, the impression from our clients is that we have a really good platform. So our acquisition of clients, our performance metrics, client satisfaction scores, all the things that we look in terms of how do clients think about us is real positive and continuing.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Excellent. Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: We will take our last question today from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. You kind of implied the loans and deposit balances might be down a little bit again in 3Q, if I heard that correctly, and they were down a little bit in 2Q here, just thoughts on where they bottom. And I understand like when we're looking at industry data where there's less than 1% loan growth, like we're talking about really small numbers, but it seems like you're still kind of lagging the H8 data a little bit and it's understandable given how much has been going on in the company. You talked about spending more in marketing and hiring people, but just thoughts on kind of where those level out and you start tracking the H.8 data a little bit more. Thanks.\nMike Maguire: Hey, Matt, thanks for the question. Maybe just taking loans first. We were hopeful we'll see some relief. We were down a little less than 1% this quarter average. In the third quarter, I think, again, base case, probably expected to be down, maybe not quite as much. We'd love to see that be different, but that's sort of what we're thinking about. And then hopefully kind of stable from there. Same on deposits -- or actually deposits a little lower perhaps in the third. We mentioned that we felt like we had some outperformance in the second quarter. We did late in the quarter, just like a lot of others, some of the just sort of seasonality and tax payments. We saw balances a little lower at the end of the quarter. That's not unusual. So we probably expect a little bit of pressure in the third quarter as well, but again, even that stabilizing in the fourth. So think down a touch in the third for both and then hopefully stable in the fourth-ish.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then just as you think about, call it, restarting kind of the loan deposit engine internally, you did allude to the marketing and hiring people, but what's like the process of just getting the message out to kind of existing employees like you got all this capital, you got all this liquidity, like you could be front-footed, and I know it takes time to kind of flip the switch, again, especially in an environment where there's still little kind of growth out there, but just touch on a couple of things you're doing to drive that.\nWilliam Rogers: Yes, sure. Rest assured that our teammates are highly focused, and there are places that we can dial more specifically and you sort of seen it. Our consumer production was up 37% over a linked-quarter, premier banking lending numbers sort of similar per branch production, those type things, so the places that we can dial in a little bit. And then on the wholesale side, it's just a lot about training, it's a lot about hiring, it's a lot about market opportunity, it's a lot about dialogue with clients, so we look at all the pitches kind of approach and we're seeing really good activity. But our teammates are on offense and they make -- let there be no confusion. I mean, our teammates are on offense. They are not in a defensive position. Trust me, the shift for them happened quite quickly. There was a -- you could hear it and feel it in terms of momentum. People are attracted to come work for our franchise for some of the same reasons as we have the capital and capability to invest in the future. So rest assured that -- your point is right, I mean, the battleship, it's hard to turn, but in terms of its direction, clear direction, clear communication, and clear focus from our teams.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Thank you.\nWilliam Rogers: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brad Milsaps for any closing remarks.\nBrad Milsaps: Okay. Thank you. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist, and we hope you have a great day.

            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. So before we discuss our second-quarter results, let's begin with purpose on Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Purpose is the foundation for things that we do. We believe purpose and performance are inextricably late. I'd like to share some of the ways we brought our purpose to life last quarter. During the quarter, Truist Securities advised and served as an active joint book-runner for Oglethorpe Power's inaugural $350 million green bond, which will be used to support their investment in Plant Vogtle, the largest producer of clean energy in the United States. The company is committed to reducing GHG emissions while delivering cost-effective and reliable clean energy with a diverse energy portfolio. This transaction represents only the second green-labeled bond in the US where the use of proceeds are allocated to nuclear energy. We also launched a new financial education program tailored specifically for high-school and college students called Truist Life, Money, and Choices. This initiative is aimed at empowering younger generations with financial lessons and essential skills to navigate their financial futures. These are just a couple of examples of how we brought our purpose to life during the quarter. I'm very proud of the meaningful work we're doing across our businesses to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients, our teammates, our communities, and of course, our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. So let's turn to our key takeaways on Slide 6. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share, which excludes the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings, the loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities, a charitable donation to the Truist Foundation, and a few smaller items that Mike will discuss in further detail in the call. In addition, pre-tax restructuring charges of $96 million, which were primarily related to the sale of TIH and severance, and also negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.05 per share. So looking through a few discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we grew adjusted revenue 3% on a linked quarter basis, which was driven by 4.5% growth of net interest income due primarily to the balance sheet reposition we completed during the quarter. Second, our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost. As a result of these efforts, adjusted expenses increased by 2.6% linked quarter and decreased by 3% on a year-over-year basis. We are fully committed to delivering our objective of keeping expenses flat in 2024 versus last year. We're also pleased that non-performing loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter and that net charge-offs were within our expectations. During the quarter, we also completed the sale of our remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which significantly strengthened our relative capital position and create substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses. In recognition of the incredibly long-term positive impact of our insurance business, we utilized a portion of the gain to make a $150 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation to further our purpose-driven work across our banking footprint for years to come. Simultaneously, with the closing of TIH, we repositioned a portion of our available-for-sale investment portfolio, which along with the proceeds received from the sale of TIH, is expected to provide an offset to TIH earnings contribution. Mike will provide more details on these transactions later in the call. In late June, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through the end of 2026. We plan to begin repurchasing our shares during the third quarter and we'll initially target share repurchases of approximately $500 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Finally, we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core consumer and wholesale banking businesses. Although, overall loan demand remained slow during the quarter, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company, which I'm going to discuss a little later in the call. So before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the financial performance in more detail, let me provide a quick update on the progress we're making in improving experiences for our clients on Slide 7. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew 7% and the digital transactions increased 13% compared to the second quarter of last year. Transactions continue to shift towards self-service capabilities, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions, which are up 39% year-over-year. In addition, we added over 180,000 new accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new to bank clients through our digital channels, which represents a 17% increase over the second quarter 2023. Importantly, digital checking account production among Gen Z and millennial clients was higher by 42% on a year-over-year basis. A new more modernized small-business digital onboarding experience has also resulted in new high in application completion rates, while we're also seeing increased digital engagement with our small-business clients. We've also made enhancements to enterprise platforms that have empowered teammates to deliver knowledge and care through 1.8 million caring conversations, resulting in 1.4 million accepted recommendations for Great Truist products and services. These enhanced offerings, coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher consumer digital client satisfaction scores as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our T3 Strategy. Overall, I'm really proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital engagement. So with that, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results in more detail. Mike? Great. Thanks, Mike. So our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged. They include growing and deepening relationships with core clients, maintaining our expense discipline, returning capital to our shareholders via share buybacks and our common strong dividend, and enhancing our digital experience through T3, all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. We made demonstrable progress on these priorities during the quarter, and I'm really proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum, and sound asset quality. All this was accomplished while also completing the divestiture of Truist Insurance Holdings and repositioning our balance sheet during the quarter. These actions created significant capital capacity to grow our Consumer and Wholesale businesses and return capital to shareholders via our strong common dividend and our recently announced repurchase authorization of up to $5 billion of our common stock. In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet is well-positioned to weather an even wider range of economic and interest-rate environments. Although the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter is expected to replace TIH's earnings in the near term, we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. As I've said previously, our starting point for our ROTCE is exactly that, it's a starting point. We're going to move with pace to deploy our capital, improve our returns, but we're not going to be in a rush to leverage capital to meet short-term expectations that do not have long term positive impact on our company, clients, and shareholders. We have a clear understanding of not only where we want to win, but where we want to win profitably. We'll look to share more of our plan with you as we progress through the remainder of this year. I can say that I'm encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential we are working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships in verticals and product lines that already exist at Truist. We have great confidence in our ability to further penetrate our existing client base, grow our core banking business, and help new and existing clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer, payments, investment banking, and wealth platform, given the ongoing investments through our existing footprint in specialty areas. In wholesale, we've invested in our investment banking and trading platform over the last several years. We've also hired experienced bankers in key industry verticals and products. These investments have resulted in greater mind share with our clients across many industry verticals and an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines. Most recently, we've invested heavily in our Payments business and have made key leadership additions as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time, not only with new clients, but also within our existing client base. We have a clear focus, high expectations, and a compelling teammate value proposition. Many of our teammates have risen to this new challenge and we have very successfully hired additional strong talent in wholesale, primarily from larger institutions who have experience and are thriving in our purpose-driven high-performance culture. We plan to continue adding talent in wholesale with a specific focus on further building out our middle-market commercial lending segment, which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional business. We will primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise. We're making these investments, while also adhering to our expense discipline, which is helping fund investments in technology to improve the client experience and also to improve risk management. In consumer, I'm really encouraged with our momentum. Our internal client satisfaction scores continue to improve as evidenced by increased net-new checking account production, increased primacy, and lower attrition rates. Net-new checking account production was once again positive in the second quarter as we added 38,000 new consumer and business accounts. Importantly, we're also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates and increased primacy and usage within new account openings. As I previously mentioned, we added 180,000 new accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new to bank clients through our digital channels, which represented a 17% increase. In addition to an increase in account openings, we're also seeing improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up 60% over the second quarter of last year. In consumer and small business lending, we've been consistently adding new small business lenders across our footprint. In the second quarter, small business applications increased 15% linked quarter, resulting in a 10% increase in our pipeline given us confidence that average consumer balance says excluding runoff in residential mortgages will stabilize in the third quarter. In conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we've made as a company at the midpoint of this year, but we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future. We have tremendous momentum within our company. We have momentum with our clients and we've got great momentum with our teammates. We have an incredible franchise, energized, purposeful teammates, and specialized capabilities that our clients value. We think the ability to grow our core banking business, our profitability, and return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years is a unique differentiating factor for Truist. I am optimistic about our future. I look-forward to operating our company from our increased position of financial strength. And finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank all of our incredible teammates and our great leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity and moving our company forward. So Brad, with that, let me hand it over back over to you for Q&A. Good morning. Yes, let me -- I'll start with the second part of that first and the answer to that is yes. But it has to have growth. We've got to sort of see that coming. Clients are on the sidelines, I mean, we can feel that in our conversations. Our conversations are increasingly a lot more strategic. So I feel like we actually even know more about what our clients are thinking, but they're a bit on the sidelines. Our production was up, so we saw production being up. It was really probably best in consumer, where it was up a little more significantly. Utilization is just absolutely flat but paydowns were also up. So in our clients that aren't towards the larger side, they were accessing the capital markets, and the good news is, I mean, you see that in our investment banking, particularly in our DCM results, I mean we're -- our capture rate on that is really, really high, so we sort of see the other part of that. Despite the pipelines being up, production being up, I just want to be careful, Ryan, about sort of like putting a stake in the ground and saying, okay, it's going to return on ex. I mean, take this weekend, I mean there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world and in the market. So while clients have capacity, we're coiled spring, ready to go, positioned better than anybody. I think we just want to be realistic about when and if that -- well, not if, but when that's going to come back and when it's going to come back with some strength. And when it does, I think to your latter part of your question, we're in the best markets and I think we should disproportionately grow faster. Yes. Yes, Ken, great question. And obviously, something that's important and we're going to be calibrating, priority one, two, and three is growing our business. I mean, we think we've got a great franchise, a great market. We're really well-positioned. We've invested in talent, we've invested in capabilities, so I think we've got the capacity and the capability to grow in our core business. So that is absolutely going to be the primary focus. We raised capital in the most efficient way possible. You just couldn't have raised it more efficiently than how we raised capital and we want to make sure that we deploy that also in the most efficient way possible long-term, long-term benefit for our shareholders. So I think we've put together a compelling return perspective with what Mike outlined. We're going to do about $500 million a quarter for the next couple of quarters, I would presume we'd enter next year in sort of the same kind of -- same kind of pace, but remember, that's also on top of we've got a really strong dividend. So in terms of total dollars returned to shareholders over the next six months, I mean, we have a really compelling value proposition. So we're going to calibrate that as we go along. We don't want to over-index on one and lose this incredible capital advantage we have for growth. Yes, and Ken, just to add to that, I mean, when we undertook this approach in the fall of last year, I mean, we were always really clear this was going to include investments and the timing of those sort of, as Mike pointed out, come quarter-to-quarter. And we're seeing the benefit of that. I mean, the investments we made in payments, investment made in talent, so the expense guidance was always coincident with that. I'll just say because I think it's really important, the discipline that we have in the company around both of those is significantly increased. So we sort of know that the next dollar to invest with a lot of confidence and we also have just incredibly strong discipline around the expense side and where the opportunities are. So I think we've got the right balance here. And as Mike said, wholly committed to a flat or better expense proposition for the remainder of this year. Yes, I mean we're -- the Investment Banking business is always going to be a little quarter-to-quarter variation. In the first quarter, we had one of the highest M&A fees in our company's history, so that sort of changed -- impacted that a bit. But most importantly, we feel really good about the momentum. So if you look at sort of our relevance, I mean, we're gaining share in virtually every category, the things that we're doing in terms of active book-runner and left lead transactions in ECM, half of our fees were being from active book-runner, dramatic change from where we've been in the past, lots of left leads transactions in there and again increased market share. And most importantly, just really good relevance. So back to sort of the comment about talent and comment about adding talent and upgrading our toolkits, our commercial bankers' focus and understanding and -- of our capabilities is just increasing exponentially. So our dialogue, as I mentioned with our clients is really strong. It's all strategic dialogue versus product dialogue, which is really good. And I think for the balance of the year, I mean, I think this is the kind of momentum we ought to be able to continue investment banking, so I think we feel good about that. Yes, Erika, just to correct one thing, we said some of a billion through the remainder of this year and we'll sort of start the next year, and the reason to put the authorization of up to and make it through 2026 is just to give us that kind of flexibility in terms of how we think about that. So we're going to calibrate that against our growth opportunities and where we see an ability to invest in our franchise and we're going to be disciplined about it. So -- and then as I mentioned earlier, remember, this is with a really strong dividend as well. So I think you can't talk about one without talking about the other in terms of total return to shareholders. So I think our unique capability to have a really good return to shareholders over the certainly near-term and medium-term from the dividend buyback is actually quite significant. And then you put on top of that our ability to earn and earn profitably and grow our business. So I think that's -- we're trying to look at all of this in the big mix. As it relates to ROTCE specifically, I mean the past numbers are the past numbers, we sort of have to start from the business model that we have now. Again, we're going to give a little more guidance on that with a little more specificity as we get towards the end of the year, as you mentioned. I think we'll have a little more knowledge as to sort of overall capital requirements. And while Basel may not be complete, I think we might have a better picture of where we might be and what the sort of CET1 base might be that we'd operate from and think about how to put all those mixes together as it relates to growth as well. So irrespective of the target itself, the growth to the target, I think is a really compelling proposition for Truist. Yes. It's hard to do that calculation sort of perfectly and we spend a lot of time thinking about it, but if you sort of look at the overall line, this was one of our best DCM quarters in a really long time. So our capture rate is really high. It's hard to put an exact percentage on that because there are puts and takes, and would you have got it otherwise and was it related to this, that, or the other? But it's really high and it's reflected in our overall DCM growth. Yes. Yes, maybe I'll start with the latter, Mike, and then I'll turn it over to you for the performance if that's okay. So the build-out of Investment Banking business has been decades plus, so this isn't sort of a new thing, and so it has been consistent. I think the way you described it is exactly right. We'll continue to build where we have relevance, where we have opportunity, and so we can be competitive and win in our markets. I think the part that gets missed though is the investment we're making around the Investment Banking business. So this is the investment that we're making with our commercial teams and our middle-market teams and expanding their knowledge and capability to talk to clients about the things that are available to them. And so think about the amount of clients in our commercial business that are now private equity-owned and our capability to be relevant in those discussions and help them along that flight path. So investment is not just in the business itself, but it's in everything that surrounds the business and in support of. We like the pace that we're growing and we think we've had a really good CAGR. If you sort of go back over time and look at the CAGR of that business, you'd sort of say that's a really good growth pattern. Importantly, we're doing it profitably, which is also important. So we have a really good efficiency of that business certainly on a on a relative basis, and we want to keep all of those in check. I mean, we don't want to grow faster than the market. We want to grow coincident with the opportunity that we have within our markets. We want to do it profitably and we want to do it sustainably. So we want to have a little less variability relative to that business. So it's tied to more of our core client capability than the vagaries of a particular market. And Mike, there was a... And the upside to that is [Multiple Speakers] Yes, maybe upside is business is better. We're trying to take an approach with what we know right now. Yes, Mike, you asked and answered part of your question as it relates to what will comment on and not comment on. But look, I've said very consistently actually since the day Truist was formed, is the size and complexity of our organization, we're going to invest in our risk framework. We're going to invest in a durable risk framework, so we can stay competitive, we can stay appropriate with our regulators and that's always been part of this expense profile. So I think even in today's prepared remarks, I mean, I'm always consistent with that, and I think everybody has got to stay in that mode. Post of March of last year, irrespective of anybody's ratings, there was just increased focus on creating a durable risk profile. So we're going to continue to be in that mode. I can't see that changing short-term, medium-term, or long-term. Are there peaks and valleys in that as you go up? Yes, does it increase proportionately? Absolutely. I mean, I just think that's the price of being in our business and also the importance of creating a durable sustainable risk framework for a company of our size and the company of our opportunity. Yes. I mean there are efficient frontiers is the way, Mike, that I like to talk about it. They're efficient frontiers and where you are on the efficient frontier relative to that. But today, I feel like we're in a good place. So we're in a good place in terms of the investments that we need and should make relative to our company our size and our ability to return and have an efficient company relative to that. So I think we're at a good place. But that efficient frontier moves, so you always have to be flexible and think about that in the context of where it moves and we're conscious of that. So today, I feel like we're in a good place. By the way, we merged our companies because we thought we were at a different place and that that was going to be more complex and we needed to have a company of the size and scale sort of seeing -- I mean, we didn't project March of last year in fairness, but understanding that the complexity and the durability and the investments needed to create that kind of risk platform was going to be needed. So that efficient frontier, I think we're in a good place on it, but it does move. Yes. I mean our sneak peek is the momentum we're creating right now. So that's the sneak peek and we want to continue to do that. Mike, you and I've talked about this. I mean, we have a strong focus on positive operating leverage. So all of our businesses have plans that are focused on positive operating leverage, that's what they try to build over time. The controllable -- more controllable factor over that is on the expense side right now, and I'm really pleased with the progress we're making. And I expect to continue to have that kind of discipline going forward. Those expenses will better reflect the revenue opportunity that we see in next year. So be assured that we've got to focus on creating that, but also be confident that we're building momentum. And I think this quarter is good evidence of that and our guidance for the rest of the year is good evidence of that. Yes, thanks. I'm not going to give expense guidance for next year. Just to say, confidence that we'll be focused on positive operating leverage, confidence that we've got great expense discipline, and expenses will more parallel the revenue opportunity. So if we see the investments that we're making, better growth opportunities in our markets, we're going to take advantage of that. And if that requires a requisite -- expense increase, then we'll do that, but that will all be in the appropriate context of focus on positive operating leverage, an efficient company that has high returns. Yes. I mean, all that's been factored into the discussions that we have. I mean, our ability -- this year, particularly to invest a lot in the payment side, is all predicated on the existing platforms that we have. The advent of the use of APIs have been really, really great opportunities to continue to invest. We had huge investments in our lending portfolios as part of the merger. So there's no like one big stair step sequenced investment, these are continuous investments in our platform and capabilities over time. Well, the momentum we've seen in the last several quarters, the impression from our clients is that we have a really good platform. So our acquisition of clients, our performance metrics, client satisfaction scores, all the things that we look in terms of how do clients think about us is real positive and continuing. Yes, sure. Rest assured that our teammates are highly focused, and there are places that we can dial more specifically and you sort of seen it. Our consumer production was up 37% over a linked-quarter, premier banking lending numbers sort of similar per branch production, those type things, so the places that we can dial in a little bit. And then on the wholesale side, it's just a lot about training, it's a lot about hiring, it's a lot about market opportunity, it's a lot about dialogue with clients, so we look at all the pitches kind of approach and we're seeing really good activity. But our teammates are on offense and they make -- let there be no confusion. I mean, our teammates are on offense. They are not in a defensive position. Trust me, the shift for them happened quite quickly. There was a -- you could hear it and feel it in terms of momentum. People are attracted to come work for our franchise for some of the same reasons as we have the capital and capability to invest in the future. So rest assured that -- your point is right, I mean, the battleship, it's hard to turn, but in terms of its direction, clear direction, clear communication, and clear focus from our teams. Thanks, Matt."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mike Maguire",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin discussing our second quarter results, I'd like to spend a few moments recapping the strategic actions that significantly impacted our second quarter results. First, on May 6, we completed the divestiture of our remaining ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings at an implied value of $15.5 billion. At closing, we received after-cash or after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $10.1 billion and recorded an after-tax gain of $4.8 billion. The sale of TIH created $9.5 billion of capital, which generated 230 basis points of CET1 under current capital rules and 250 basis -- 254 basis points of capital under proposed fully phased in Basel III rules. Our tangible book value per share also increased by 33%. On the same day, we executed a strategic balance sheet repositioning of a portion of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. We sold approximately $27.7 billion of market value, lower-yielding investment securities, which resulted in an after-tax loss of $5.1 billion. The investment securities that we sold had a book value of $34.4 billion and a weighted average book yield of 2.80% for the remainder of 2024, including the impact of hedges and based on the federal funds curve at that time. Including the tax benefit, the sale of investment securities generated $29.3 billion of proceeds available for reinvestment. When coupled with the proceeds from the sale of TIH, there were $39.4 billion of proceeds available for reinvestment. Of that, we invested approximately $18.7 billion in Investment Securities yielding 5.27%, with the remaining $20.7 billion held in cash. At the time we invested the proceeds, the blended reinvestment rate on the new investment securities purchased and the cash was 5.22% for the remainder of 2024, including the impact of hedges. As Bill mentioned, the reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter are expected to replace TIH's earnings contributions. These actions completed during the second quarter significantly accelerate our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry and importantly, create capacity for Truist to grow its core banking franchise and to return capital to shareholders via our strong dividend and share repurchases. Now turning to our second-quarter key performance highlights on Slide 9. We reported second quarter 2024 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $826 million or $0.62 per share. This included a net loss of $4 billion from continuing operations or $2.98 per share and net income from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or $3.60 per share. The net loss available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $4 billion or $2.98 per share was impacted by the following items: a $6.7 billion pre-tax or $3.80 per share after-tax loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities; a $150 million pre-tax or $0.09 per share charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation, a $13 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after tax expense related to FDIC special assessment adjustment. Net income available to common shareholders from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or $3.60 per share was impacted by the following items: a $6.9 billion pre-tax or $3.60 per share after-tax gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings; a $10 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after-tax expense due to the accelerated recognition of TIH equity-based compensation. So, on an adjusted basis we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $96 million in the quarter, which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.05 per share. Approximately $33 million of these pre-tax charges or $0.02 per share after tax negatively impacted net income from continuing operations and were primarily related to severance and real estate rationalization. The remaining restructuring charges were recorded in discontinued operations and were related to legal and other expenses associated with closing the divestiture of TIH. Total revenue adjusted for the losses on the available-for-sale investment securities increased 3% linked quarter due to a 4.5% increase in net interest income and relatively stable non-interest income. Adjusted expenses increased 2.6% linked quarter, but were down approximately 3% on a like quarter basis. Our CET1 ratio increased by 150 basis points linked quarter to 11.6%, primarily reflecting the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning I discussed earlier. In addition, net charge-offs declined 6 basis points on a linked quarter basis and our non-performing loans remained relatively stable, both on a like and linked quarter basis. Moving to Slide 10. Average loans decreased 0.7% on a sequential basis, reflecting overall weaker client demand. Average commercial loans decreased $1.3 billion or 0.7%, primarily due to a 0.8% decline in C&I balances, driven at least in part by capital markets activity. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased $1 billion or 0.9% due to runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio and a decline in indirect auto. Other consumer balances, which include our specialty lending units, experienced modest growth and benefited from seasonal strength at Sheffield and increased demand at Service Finance. Overall, we expect client loan demand to remain relatively muted in the third quarter. Moving to deposit trends on Slide 11. Average deposits decreased 0.3% sequentially as growth in money market and savings was offset by declines in non-interest bearing time and brokered balances. Average non-interest bearing deposits decreased 1.2% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged compared to 28% during the first quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we experienced an increase in deposit costs, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter. Specifically, total deposit costs increased 6 basis points sequentially, 2.09%, which resulted in a 1% increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 39%. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 7 basis points sequentially to 2.89%, which also resulted in a 1% increase to our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta cost, up 54%. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 12. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income increased 4.5% linked quarter or $155 million, primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this repositioning, our net interest income would have been relatively stable on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to our focus on average client deposits, which declined less than we expected. Reported net interest margin increased 14 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.03%. This was due primarily to the impact of the balance sheet repositioning. The partial quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning helped to drive a 31 basis point improvement in the average yield on our investment securities portfolio to 2.77%. We estimate that our balance sheet remains positioned as relatively neutral from an interest-rate perspective comparable to Q1. Turning to non-interest income on Slide 13. Adjusted non-interest income, which excludes the losses associated with the balance sheet repositioning decreased $8 million or 0.6% relative to the first quarter. The linked quarter decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment banking and trading income, which declined $37 million from our strong first quarter performance due to lower M&A fees, equity originations, and trading income, partially offset by higher loan syndication fees. This decline was partially offset by higher mortgage banking and other income. Adjusted non-interest income increased 4.2% on a like-quarter basis as higher investment banking and trading and wealth management income were partially offset by lower service charge on deposit and other income. On a year-to-date basis, investment banking and trading income is up nearly 30% over the same period in 2023. Now, I'll cover non-interest expense on Slide 14. GAAP expenses of $3.1 billion increased $141 million linked quarter, primarily due to higher other expense-related to $150 million charitable donation, higher personnel costs reflecting merit increases, and higher professional fees. These increases were offset by lower restructuring charges and a reduction in FDIC expense due to a larger special assessment recorded in the first quarter. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.6% sequentially due to higher personnel expense and professional fees. On a like-quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined $86 million or 3%, reflecting lower headcount and our continued expense discipline. Moving to Asset Quality on Slide 15. Asset Quality remained stable on both a like and linked quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio decreased 6 basis points to 58 basis points. The decrease in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects lower consumer losses due to normal second quarter seasonal declines and certain derisking initiatives put in place in the second half of 2022. Our loan loss provision declined $49 million linked quarter, reflecting our stable credit performance, but it still exceeded net charge-offs for the quarter, resulting in a slight build to our overall loan loss allowance. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.57%, up 1 basis point sequentially and 14 basis points year-over-year, which reflects ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector. Despite the normalization, non-performing loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter, while total delinquencies increased just 2 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Wholesale criticized loans declined $1 billion linked quarter to $10.8 billion. Included in our appendix is an updated -- is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.6% of total loans. However, we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 9.3% to 9.7% during the quarter to reflect continued stress in the sector. Approximately 6.3% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing compared with 5.5% at March 31st. Approximately, 90% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. Notably, approximately 22% of our office portfolio is housed within our Community Banking and Wealth segments, where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent, and overall loss is lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well-reserved, but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio. Turning now to capital on Slide 16. Truist CET1 ratio increased from 10.1% at March 31st to 11.6% at June 30. The increase was driven by the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and organic capital generation, which was partially offset by the loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities during the quarter, which I addressed earlier. Importantly, the sale of TIH creates capacity for Truist to pursue growth opportunities in our Consumer and Wholesale Banking businesses and to return significant capital to shareholders, as evidenced by our share buyback program. Truist is well-positioned to weather a wide variety of economic scenarios, which was evident in our most recent CCAR stress-test results released in late June. Specifically, Truist had the second-lowest C&I loan loss rate and the third-lowest CET1 erosion rate versus our peers. Our stress capital buffer will improve by 10 basis points to 2.8%, effective October 1st. At June 30, our CET1 ratio was 430 basis points higher than our new regulatory minimum of 7.3%, leaving us well-positioned to both grow our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. Our increased level of capital accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry as our estimated CET1 capital ratio under proposed Basel III endgame rules improved 20 basis points to 9.1% at June 30, which is 180 basis points above our new regulatory minimum. And now, I will review updated guidance -- our updated guidance on Slide 17. Looking into the third quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to increase 1% to 2% from second quarter 2024 adjusted revenue of $5 billion. We expect net interest income to increase 2% to 3% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a full quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning completed on May 6. We expect non-interest income to remain relatively stable on a linked quarter basis. Adjusted expenses of $2.8 billion in the second quarter are expected to increase by 3% in the third quarter due to higher professional fees, software costs, and higher marketing costs. For the full year 2024, we previously expected revenues to be down 0.5% to 1.5%. We now expect total revenues to decline by approximately 0.5% to 1% in 2024. Our updated outlook is based on slightly better client deposit balance performance, partially offset by lower client loan demand and our updated view of interest rates, which now assumes just one reduction in the Federal Funds rate in November of this year. Consistent with our previous expense outlook, we expect full year 2024 adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over 2023 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion. In terms of Asset Quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024. As Bill previously mentioned, we are targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases per quarter for the remainder of the year as part of our share repurchase authorization announced in late June. Finally, we expect our effective tax-rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a taxable equivalent basis in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Now, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks. Hey, good morning, Ryan. We mentioned in our comments that we do expect the NII to improve next quarter by 2% to 3%, really, the bulk of that is driven by just the full quarter impact of the repositioning that we completed back in May. We continue to expect there to be some pressure on client deposit balances as well as loan balances, so maybe a touch conservative there. We did have some nice, just to say it, just some nice outperformance in the second quarter on client deposit balances, which really helped stabilize that core NII ex the bonds. But that's really sort of the story for Q2. And I think Q4, just looking out a little further, if you think about kind of rest of year trajectory, kind of more of the same, right? I mean, we mentioned we've got a November cut in. We think that helps a touch, but that is the first cut and it's pretty late. So we've got pretty modest expectations around the impact there. And I think for us, really what will stimulate some improvement on the NII side will just be some of the core balances. So getting client loan demand increased, getting -- which hopefully will generate balances as well, and I'll just mention this, I mean we're very focused around the company, pick your segment or [LOB] (ph), everybody in the company is very focused on realizing that growth opportunity once it presents itself. It's just -- and you've heard this from I think others this week and last week, there just has really not been a lot of client activity. Hey, Ken, it's Mike. Maybe take a swing at that one. No, you're right. I mean, look, we think we do see growth in the third quarter on the expense side, I think that's still on a like basis, close to flat, maybe even a touch better, and I think that implies, if you think about flat, maybe a touch of growth in the fourth as well. Look, I mean, the first half of the year, we were very focused on cost discipline and frankly following through on our commitment around flat. That's still important to us. But as we've sort of gotten to the midway mark, it's -- there have been certain projects, whether it be some marketing spend sort of you name it, nits and nats that perhaps were delayed and that drove some of the beat maybe even this quarter and even in last quarter, and so some of that stuff just makes a ton of sense. And as we really shift our mindset, and you heard Bill talk a little bit about it in his prepared remarks around some of the hiring we're doing in middle-market lending as an example, around our Payments business, some calibrating of marketing spend, et cetera, these are all factors that are driving our outlook for the second half, and so, look, we feel -- and we've said this is really since last fall, we are very, very confident and committed to being sort of 0.0 or better on expenses this year. Yes, good morning, Scott. Yes, so we do have the one cut in November. If we got one earlier, call it, I think the curve today has a September cut and maybe December and maybe even a touch more than that, that would be a help for us. We -- look, we -- our baseline path does show benefit from down rates. I think the question and I brought it up in sort of my earlier question, I think that Ryan asked, that first cut given how high we are and how late we expected, we're just trying to be reasonable and thinking about the benefit we'll get there. But I think you're right, I think if we got one earlier and then maybe perhaps a second, that would be a good guy. I will say this, I think just given where we are in terms of how high we are and how long we've been here and some of the client behavior that we're able to observe, I think the more impactful catalyst will be, again, getting some of that loan demand and balanced growth and client deposit growth as well. So would take it all. Yes, Erika, I appreciate the question. I mean -- look, I think there was a beat on balances in the second quarter, especially if you look at it on an average basis, and so our rate paid was a touch better than we thought, and so you're right, starting position better than where we sort of would have expected to be in April. I think the pressures that we expected in the second quarter, we still believe will persist in the third, especially in terms of balances and rate paid. Another piece of this is that while we did get some benefit on our net interest margin from the bonds like recouponing, some of the benefit as well is just on a smaller balance sheet. So we did -- for example, we paid down some wholesale liabilities late in the second that will come through in the third on an average basis. So you'll see more net interest margin improvement, but it will be on a more efficient smaller balance sheet. On rates, I don't want to call the ball on conservative -- non-conservative, I think we're cautious on what benefit we'll get on the first cut or two. We've thought about it a lot, done a lot of work and analysis. You look at sort of historically, over the last, call it, 30 years, the down cycles and the betas have been slow, right? So I think that's in our thinking too for the rest of the year. And look, I've said this a couple of times. I think for us, the thing -- we're like feel fine about the guidance we gave, I think what would really be upside for us would be a little bit of pull-through on more client activity and the ability to generate more loan volume and with that will come deposits. You get that and maybe you get Scott's extra cut in early and that feels good. I mean the hurts are obviously the cut we've got, no cuts perhaps, maybe that's not such a bad guy, and then just the pressure that we've been seeing on balances, both deposits and loans. Good morning, Betsy. Yes, Betsy, I think that's roughed out, you could see us sort of sliding sideways for a while for the reasons you mentioned, you're right. I mean you take the $500 million buyback and, call it, $700 million or so dividend, you're approximately at -- this is rough earnings, right? And I think you're right, we don't expect significant ROA improvement or decline over the period. I'll just say this, I mean -- and you mentioned sort of CET1 target, Bill referred to it as well, I think a couple of things just to think about there. One, we like operating with a higher level of capital in today's world, one. It affords us the right, we think strength and resiliency and ability to sort of react to the world. Importantly, we've got a growth agenda. We're focused on prosecuting that's company-wide. You feel that with any -- especially frontline, but really across the whole company, and then Bill mentioned sort of the capability to return capital and that can come in various forms. But yes, I think modeling us somewhat flat short-term. But again, we -- our expectation is that we'll begin to grow RWAs next year and so that's how we're thinking about it. Yes, John, I think you asked just about the trajectory for the second half for fees, I think some -- you don't know to -- put some puts and takes, our outlook is relatively stable really for the second half, so call it, stable, stable. Hey, Matt, thanks for the question. Maybe just taking loans first. We were hopeful we'll see some relief. We were down a little less than 1% this quarter average. In the third quarter, I think, again, base case, probably expected to be down, maybe not quite as much. We'd love to see that be different, but that's sort of what we're thinking about. And then hopefully kind of stable from there. Same on deposits -- or actually deposits a little lower perhaps in the third. We mentioned that we felt like we had some outperformance in the second quarter. We did late in the quarter, just like a lot of others, some of the just sort of seasonality and tax payments. We saw balances a little lower at the end of the quarter. That's not unusual. So we probably expect a little bit of pressure in the third quarter as well, but again, even that stabilizing in the fourth. So think down a touch in the third for both and then hopefully stable in the fourth-ish."

            "content": "Hey, John, this is Clarke. As Mike and Bill said, we were very pleased with the overall asset quality for the quarter and we generally had stable delinquencies. We had flat NPLs and our losses were a touch lower, particularly in this consumer area. So we still see in the consumer side, the normalization that's occurring due to higher rates, inflation, and the stimulus burndown, particularly for the lower end consumer. So we've been a little careful there even in this quarter's reserve. We added a little bit for those lower income consumer finance areas. And then you're right, on the CRE side and the office exposure, we still just want to make sure we're addressing the uncertainty there. On the wholesale C&I side, we actually had, as Bill said, lower watch list, and even though we're monitoring areas like the leverage book, consumer discretionary, senior care, transportation, some of those more rate-sensitive areas, we've not had any big sector issues to date, it's been more episodic. So when we think about our reserves, we feel really good about the adequacy of where we are today and it reflects what we know today. So unless there's a substantial change in the economic outlook or that level of uncertainty in areas of stress like CRE office would emerge higher, we wouldn't expect our reserve levels for the remainder of 2024 to be relatively stable."

Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, today's event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's first quarter 2024 earnings call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire; and our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer, Clarke Starnes, as well as other members of Truist's Senior Management team. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's first-quarter results, share their perspective on current business conditions, and provide an updated outlook for 2024. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slides two and three of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I will turn it over to Bill.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. So before we discuss our first quarter results, let's begin as always with purpose. We see that on slide four. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspire and building better lives and communities. And I'd like to share some of the ways we brought purpose to life last quarter. Our focus on small-business heroes is a great example of purpose-driving performance This strategy helps community heroes achieve their financial dreams and elevates their ability to support our neighbors and build strong communities. We're seeing great success with small business, evidenced by the addition of nearly 8,600 small business accounts during the quarter and $700 million worth of deposits. Our Truist Community capital team committed more than $252 million to support over 1,600 units of affordable housing, over 3,000 new jobs, and projects that will help empower almost 400,000 people in underserved communities over the next three years. Additionally, we announced the initial recipients of grants from the Truist Community Catalyst Initiative, which is a three-year Community Reinvestment Act program aimed at four key focus areas: Affordable housing, small business access to capital, workforce development, and essential community services. There are 17 community organizations receiving grants that will be used to support efforts in 54 communities across 13 states and allow local non-profit organizations to better respond to critical community needs within their states. Lastly, we published our 2023 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability report this month, which I encourage you to read and learn more about our progress in building better lives and communities. In all of these examples, our core belief is evident. We're leaders in banking and we are unwavering in care. All right, so let's turn to some of our key takeaways on slide six. First, I need to state and remind everyone that our first quarter and for the previous periods have been restated to reflect the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This change has no impact on our net income available to common shareholders. The restatement does remove TIH's revenue and expense from our financial statements as net income from TIH has now been reported as net income from discontinued operation. Mike is going to provide a lot more details around that later in the call. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 a share, which excludes a $0.04 per share impact from the industry-wide FDIC special assessment, and a $0.05 per share impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale. Pre-tax restructuring charges of $70 million negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.04 per share. So despite a few discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we saw a significant increase in investment banking and trading revenue, driven by strong performance across much of our capital markets platform with particular strength in M&A and equity capital markets. Loan demand continues to remain relatively muted, but we did see some improvement in our commercial lending pipelines during the quarter. On the consumer side, we recalibrated several of the capital-conserving strategies we deployed last year, prior to announcing the sale of TIH. This resulted in an increase in loan applications and in March, we saw the first increase in balance since October of 2022. Second, our results show our expense discipline and continued focus on managing cost. As a result of these efforts, adjusted expenses increased by less than 1% linked quarter and decreased by 4% on a year-over-year basis. Although, the linked-quarter rate of expense growth will increase in the second quarter relative to the first, we are fully committed to delivering our expense objectives in 2024, which excluding TIH should now result in adjusted expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024 versus 2023. Our asset quality continues to normalize of historically low levels, but we're pleased that non-performing loans remained relatively stable and the net charge-offs were within our expectations. Finally, during the quarter, we also announced that we'll be sell -- we'll sell our remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which is on track to close in the second quarter. The sale of TIH will significantly strengthen our relative capital position, which will create substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses. In addition, as we discussed in February, our stronger capital position affords us an opportunity to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities post-closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning designed to at least replace TIH earnings. The sale of TIH also positions us to resume share repurchases. The timing and size of repurchase activity will be -- will depend on our ongoing capital planning, market conditions, clarity around final capital rules, and other factors. But our goal is to resume a program that's both meaningful and durable. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail, I want to provide a quick update on the progress we're making and improving experiences for our clients, which we see on slide seven. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities. In the first quarter of 2024, mobile app users grew 8% and digital transactions increased 13%, compared to the first quarter of last year. Though activating teammates -- through activating teammates to educate clients on our capabilities, transactions continue to shift towards self-service capabilities with 77% of the deposits occurring through these channels, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions. Recently, we rolled out Zelle QR code widget, where users can quickly access their QR codes from their home screens to seamlessly assist with bank transfers. At Truist, we aim to make banking simple and easy for our clients through thoughtful enhancements to their experience. Enhanced offerings coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher retail digital client satisfaction scores. These scores surpassed pre-merger highs as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our T3 strategy. Overall, I'm proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital and optimistic about the opportunity to expand our digital user base and drive self-service transaction volume. So with Mike -- with that Mike, let me turn it over to you to discuss our financial results in a little more detail.\nMike Maguire: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our financial statements for the first quarter and for previous periods have been restated due to the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This restatement has no impact on our net income or earnings per share for historical or current reporting periods. However, and as you can see on our financial tables, revenue and expense associated with TIH is no longer shown on our financial statements. TIH's contribution to Truist net income and earnings per share is now captured in net income from discontinued operations. My comments today will focus on revenue and expense from continuing operations, although I will also provide some detail on revenue and expense for the quarter inclusive of TIH for comparative purposes. We reported net income available from continuing operations of $1 billion or $0.76 per share, which includes a $75 million pre-tax or $0.04 per share after-tax expense related to the industry-wide FDIC special assessment. We reported net income available from discontinued operations, which represents earnings from TIH of $64 million or $0.05 per share, which includes an $89 million pre-tax or $0.05 per share negative impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale. So on an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 per share, which includes adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.80 and adjusted net income from discontinued operations of $0.10. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $70 million in the quarter, which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.04 per share. The bulk of these charges were related to severance and real-estate rationalization. Total revenue, which excludes revenue associated with TIH, decreased by 1.4% linked-quarter due to a decline in net interest income, partially offset by stronger non-interest income led by investment banking and trading. Revenue before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 0.2% on a linked quarter basis. Adjusted expenses, which excludes adjusted expense associated with TIH, increased by 0.7%. Adjusted expenses before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked quarter basis. Next, I'll cover loans and leases on slide nine. Average loans decreased 1.3% sequentially, reflecting overall weaker client demand and our decision to deemphasize certain lending activities during 2023, which impacted growth during the first quarter. Average commercial loans decreased to 0.9%, primarily due to a 1.2% decrease in C&I balances due mostly to lower client demand. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased 2%, primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage. During the quarter, we did increase our appetite for high-quality indirect auto loans, which as Bill mentioned, resulted in consumer loan balances showing positive growth for the month of March. Overall, we expect average loan balances to decline modestly in the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter. Moving to deposit trends on slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1.6% sequentially as growth in client time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in non-interest-bearing brokered and money market balances. Approximately $1.9 billion of the $6.3 billion linked quarter decline in average deposits was due to lower brokered deposits. Adjusting for broker deposits, our average deposits declined approximately 1%. Non-interest bearing deposits decreased 4.9% and represented 28% of total deposits, compared to 29% in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the quarter, consumers continued to seek higher-rate alternatives, which drove an increase in deposit costs. Specifically, total deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially to 2.03%, which resulted in a 2% increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 38%. Similarly, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially to 2.82%, which also resulted in a 2% increase in our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta of 53%. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 4.2% linked quarter, primarily due to higher rate paid on deposits, lower day count in the quarter, and lower average earning assets. Reported net interest margin declined 7 basis points on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to non-interest income on slide 12. Non-interest income increased $83 million or 6.1% relative to the fourth quarter. The linked quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher investment banking and trading income, which was up $158 million linked quarter, due to strong results across much of our entire capital markets platform with specific strength in M&A and equity capital markets. Lending-related fees decreased $57 million linked-quarter due to lower leasing-related gains. Non-interest income increased 1.8% on a like-quarter basis, as higher investment banking and trading, wealth, and other income were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit and mortgage banking income. Next, I'll cover non-interest expense on slide 13. GAAP expenses of $3 billion decreased $6.6 billion linked quarter, as fourth quarter 2023 expenses were negatively impacted by a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge, a $507 million FDIC special assessment, and $155 million of restructuring charges primarily related to our cost-savings initiatives. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense increased 0.7% sequentially. The increase in adjusted expense was driven by higher personnel expense of $156 million due to normal seasonal factors and higher variable incentive compensation, partially offsetting the increase in personnel expense were lower other expenses, which declined $82 million, reflecting lower operating charge-offs and lower pension expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses before the impact of discontinued operations, accounting -- discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked quarter basis. On a like quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined $120 million or 4.2%, reflecting lower headcount and continued expense discipline. Moving to asset quality on slide 14. Asset quality metrics continue to normalize in the first quarter, but overall remained manageable. Non-performing loans remained relatively stable to linked-quarter, while total delinquencies were down 6 basis points sequentially, driven by a 7 basis point decline in loans 30 to 89 days past due. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.7% of total loans. However, we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 8.5% to 9.3% during the quarter to reflect continued stress in this sector. We expect stress to remain in the office sector, but believe that the size of our office portfolio is manageable and well reserved. Approximately 5.5% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing, but 89% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. During the quarter, our net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 64 basis points. The increase in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects increases in our CRE and consumer portfolios, offset by lower C&I and CRE construction losses. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.56%, up 2 basis points sequentially, and 19 basis points on a year-over-year basis due to ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we've tightened our risk appetite in select areas that we maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality long-term clients. Turning now to capital on slide 15. Truist's CET1 ratio remained relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis at 10.1%, as organic capital generation and the impact of lower risk-weighted assets were mostly offset by the impact of the CECL phase-in that occurred during the quarter. We still anticipate the sale of TIH will generate approximately 230 basis points of CET1 under current rules and 255 basis points of CET1 capital under proposed Basel III endgame rules. It will also increase our tangible book value per share by 33% through a combination of a $4.8 billion after-tax gain and the deconsolidation of $4.7 billion of goodwill and intangibles from our balance sheet. The divestiture of TIH has a 255 basis point positive impact under the fully proposed phase-in Basel III endgame rules, which is 25 basis points higher than under current rules. The larger impact on our CET1 ratio under the proposed rules is due to the reduction in certain threshold deductions due to the overall higher level of capital from selling TIH. The sale of TIH accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry. And importantly, creates capacity for Truist to evaluate a wide variety of capital deployment alternatives, including growing our core banking franchise during a time when much of the industry is conserving capital, repositioning our balance sheet, and resuming share repurchases. As it relates to a possible repositioning, recognizing securities losses under proposed Basel III rules would have no impact on our fully phased-in CET1 ratio since current proposed rules include AOCI in the calculation. Moreover, any decision to sell market value securities has no impact on our tangible book value per share. I will now review our updated guidance on slide 16. First, all of my comments today related to second quarter and full-year 2024 guidance exclude any benefit from interest income that Truist will earn on the $10.1 billion of after-tax cash proceeds that we expect to receive from the pending sale of TIH. Our guidance also excludes any impact from a potential balance sheet repositioning that we plan to evaluate post-closing. In addition, revenue and expense guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024 is based on revenue and expense from continuing operations and does not include any contribution from TIH in previous or in future periods. Looking into the second quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to decline about 2% from 1Q '24 GAAP revenue of $4.9 billion. Net interest income is likely to be down 2% to 3% in the second quarter due to continued pressure on rate paid and a smaller balance sheet. We expect non-interest income to remain relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis. Adjusted expenses of $2.7 billion in the first quarter are expected to increase 4% in Q2, due to higher professional fees, some timing of projects delayed from Q1, higher marketing costs, and annual merit increases. For the full-year 2024, we previously expected revenues to be down 1% to 3%, which would have included revenue from Truist Insurance Holdings. If we had excluded revenue from Truist Insurance Holdings from our outlook, our expectation would have been closer to down 3% to down 5% in 2024. Today, we are tightening our previous revenue guidance adjusted for TIH of down approximately 3% to down 5% to now down approximately 4% to 5% to reflect the latest interest-rate outlook and continued pressure on the deposit mix, partially offset by our improved outlook for non-interest income. Our outlook assumes three reductions in the Fed Funds rate with the first reduction coming in June 2024. Previously, we assumed five reductions in the Fed Funds rate with the first reduction occurring in May 2024. We still assume that net interest income will trough in the second quarter of 2024 and modestly improve in the second-half of the year. Fewer than three rate reductions would add pressure to our NII outlook and result in our annual revenue coming in at the lower end of our range for revenue to be down 4% to 5%. As a reminder, our second quarter and full-year revenue outlook excludes any benefit from interest income earned on the cash proceeds from the sale of TIH or the benefit of potential balance sheet repositioning. As Bill mentioned, we still expect the sale of TIH to be completed during the second quarter. We previously expected our expenses to remain flat or to increase by 1% in 2024, which included expenses associated with Truist Insurance Holdings. If we had excluded expected expenses from Truist Insurance Holdings from our outlook, our expectation would equate to expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024. Consistent with our previous expense outlook adjusted for TIH, we expect full-year \u201824 adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over 2023 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion. In terms of asset quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a taxable equivalent basis. Our estimated tax rate excludes any impact from the gain on the sale of TIH or a potential balance sheet repositioning that we might consider following the sale. So now I'll turn it back to Bill for some final remarks.\nBill Rogers: Great. Thanks, Mike. I am proud of the results our teammates delivered during the first quarter, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum, and the announced sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. As Mike mentioned, TIH will enter its partnership with its new investors with strong momentum as evidenced by its first quarter results. Providing risk advice to our clients is core to our purpose, we look forward to maintaining a strong partnership with that team into the future. We have great confidence in our capability to grow our core banking business and help our clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer, payments, investment banking, and wealth platform throughout existing footprint, and specialty areas. Our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged and include growing and deepening relationships with core clients, maintaining our expense discipline, evaluating various capital deployment options following the sale of TIH, and enhancing Truist's digital experience through T3, all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. Our expense discipline is showing up in our results, which gives us confidence that we'll meet our expense objectives this year. I'm also encouraged by the improvement in our wholesale banking business, which includes investment banking and trading as it was a key driver of our quarterly results. In investment banking, we've increased our market share across several capital market products due to significant investment in talent and industry verticals. These investments have resulted in significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products, including equity capital markets, leveraged finance, asset securitization, and M&A. In addition, our mind share with clients in our key industry verticals has never been stronger and we continue to expand into new verticals that are primed for growth as capital markets activities recover. We are seeing solid year-over-year growth in referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver value-added advice and capabilities to our clients. Our commercial teammates have responded to new expectations and we continue to add great talent to our comprehensive platform. And finally, we made new key leadership hires within our payments business during the quarter as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time. In consumer, I'm encouraged that our internal consumer satisfaction scores have returned to pre-merger levels. In addition, net new checking account production was positive in the first quarter as we added 30,000 new consumer and business accounts. Importantly, we're also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates. Also during the first quarter, our digital channel, we acquired 172,000 accounts, including 63,000 new to Truist, while also seeing a 14% increase in deposit balances over the fourth quarter of 2023. While the branch network represents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets, we continue to see improvements in productivity due to teammate execution and investments in technology. We're encouraged by this increased productivity, we'll look to make investments in branches and select key growth markets in 2025. Overall, loan demand does remain muted, but I'm encouraged by the improvement in our commercial loan pipelines and the growth we witnessed in consumer balances late in the first quarter. By selling TIH, we'll have capital capacity to play more offense in our consumer and wholesale businesses, which includes seeking ways to accelerate loan growth in our core franchise. In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet will be positioned to weather an even wider range of economic environments, while also giving us the unique ability to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities post-closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning and resuming meaningful share repurchases later in the year. Although we have a plan to replace TIH earnings in the near-term, we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. Our starting point for ROTCE following the sale of TIH will be exactly that, a starting point. The strength of our markets, our core banking franchise, our capital deployment options we can consider after the sale will result in improved returns over time. We'll move with pace, but we'll not be in a rush to deploy capital to meet short-term expectations that don't have a long-term positive impact on our company, our clients, our shareholders, especially since Basel III capital rules have not been firmly established for the industry. So in conclusion, we're off to a solid start in 2024, but we acknowledge, as always, there's more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future. We view our first quarter performance as another step forward in that direction. I'm optimistic about our future, I look forward to operating our company from this increased position of financial strength in some of the best markets in the country. And finally, I'd like to thank all of our teammates and our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity, particularly over the last few months during this important time for both TIH and for Truist. So with that Brad, let me hand it back over to you for Q&A.\nBrad Milsaps: Thank you, Bill. Jamie, at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up, in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today on the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn McDonald: Great. Thank you. Good morning. How the rate environment changes at all -- if at all, the ability and willingness to deploy through the restructuring of the securities book. Mike, maybe you could just comment higher rates, presumably achieving that neutral impact gets a little bit easier. Does that affect how much you might do? And maybe Bill could just make some broader comments about the options you'll have to deploy organically and buybacks and other things? Thank you.\nMike Maguire: Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. Look, I mean -- we're certainly taking a look at the market rate environment and I'd say just the framework that we shared back in February, we remain committed to, right? And, so we laid out a set of objectives that spanned maintaining a relative capital position, at least replacing the earnings from TIH, we also have ambitions around advancing our liquidity and ALM position. So the rate environment and we talked about that in February is a touch different than what we're looking at today, but we think still, you know, actionable and so we -- our plans to evaluate repositioning after we complete the sale are still intact. I mean, if you look at the short-end of the curve, certainly, we see probably a little bit of benefit relative to what we talked about from a cash reinvestment perspective, and the same goes if you think about reinvestment rates on the bonds, but on the other hand, you do have the trade-off of a slightly higher realized loss in that instance.\nBill Rogers: I'll go into the others, and as you said, John, I mean, we're in a different rate environment, so we'll evaluate all the other alternatives that exist with that, and there's some things that have some shorter paybacks that I think should be evaluated in that alternative. And then also we have some tax efficiency as it relates to this. So we have some unique components of doing this in line with the TIH sale. And then you mentioned sort of what are the other capital deployment options? You know obviously, the first and foremost for us is growth in our business. I mean sort of investing in our business. You saw in this quarter some of the things we did on the consumer side where we leaned in a little bit. Quite frankly, we think some of the margins are still strong in those businesses. So that, what we're adding is a little more accretive than it would have been in the past. The risk profile has been strong. So we have the capacity to dial some of that up on the consumer side. And then on the wholesale side, just our relevance is more important. So what we're -- we don't want to give up all the discipline. We created a lot of discipline around pricing and around structure and again, what we're adding today is much more accretive. So we'll continue to pursue opportunities in our markets and through our industry verticals and we've got good momentum in that front. And then lastly, on the share repurchase side, we're going to--we'll be back in the share repurchase business, that will be part of the portfolio. As I mentioned before, we're going to do all this with pace. So I think it would be -- you know, reasonable to assume we'll have some type of meaningful share repurchase sort of -- sort of short, medium-term, and then longer-term, and just a more durable consistent share repurchase plan. So it's a combination of all those things factored into the equation, which give us, as I said before a lot of optimism about being able to improve those returns short-term, importantly, but most importantly over the long-term.\nJohn McDonald: That's really helpful, thanks. And maybe as a quick follow-up, we saw a really strong investment banking results this quarter. How much of that is good environment versus payback on some of the investments you've made in that business, and maybe just comment on what's packed in your outlook for the second quarter there, Mike? Thanks.\nMike Maguire: Yes. I mean, a lot of it obviously is from market improvement, but as you noted, I mean, we've been investing in this business for quite some time, particularly over the last several years. You know, our existing team has really set horizon to the challenge. They're working really great with the commercial team. So we're seeing all the pull-through from our franchise, we've brought 30 plus new MDs into our -- into our business. So these are teammates with great expertise and great access. So I think it's a combination of all those things and we're really confident. I mean, we're confident heading into the second quarter and the rest of the year about the momentum in this business.\nJohn McDonald: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nMike Maguire: Hi.\nBill Rogers: Betsy, good morning, and welcome back.\nBetsy Graseck: Thanks so much.\nBill Rogers: Great. Great to hear your voice.\nBetsy Graseck: Thanks so much, Bill. I really appreciate it. So I did just want to lean in on the loan side, a couple of comments in the prepared remarks that you made. One was on commercial lending pipelines building and I wanted to understand, is this a change? And I mean, we often hear about pipelines in the investment banking side, not as much on the commercial lending side. And I wanted to understand your thoughts around what execution on that requires, is it lower rates, is it customers building more inventory, or just some color on that would be really helpful? Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Yeah. And I did note it because it's a little bit different. So in the fourth quarter, we started seeing pipelines decrease a little bit. And here in the first quarter, we've seen pipelines improve, particularly on the commercial side. You know, how they get to execution and how they get to finalization will depend on a lot of market conditions. But the good news is clients are -- they're having the discussions, they're having the debate about the new warehouse or the new fleet of trucks the things that they want to do to continue to expand their businesses. But most importantly, we're just more relevant. I mean, we're just more relevant in those discussions. I mean, the activity that we've been able to create in terms of new relationships, I mean, almost 60% of the activity that we added in the quarter were new relationships. So new to Truist. So I think a lot of it's at pitch activity is up, all the things we're doing, new left leads are up. So I think it's some combination of a little bit of the markets that we operate, probably a little more optimistic than the rest of the country. Our investments that we've made, products, capabilities, and our overall relevance with our clients. So we're talking to them about things they want to listen to, they want to talk about, and I think we're just better-positioned than we've ever been.\nBetsy Graseck: And is that -- okay, so then the follow-up is on the auto side, you mentioned that you're leaning into indirect and high quality. So I just wanted to understand, you know, what does high-quality indirect autos mean to you? And then the relevance to corporate clients increasing, is that a function of balance sheet size or product mix or maybe you just -- I know I squeezed in two, but it was a follow-up plus a follow-up? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Betsy, you get extra permission.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Yes, exactly. Yes, so on the auto side, maybe to compare and contrast, it's not rack for us, it's sort of our core prime auto business in terms of growth. And again, just being able to be a little more relevant to our dealers, and creating a little more capacity, you\u2019ve seen lots of changes from people in and out of the auto side. We like the consistency of it. And again, we have a deep strong relationships with lots of dealers and this just adds to that portfolio. And then on the corporate side, same thing on the -- if the question was related to the risk profile, similar kind of risk profile, I mean, we're -- we created, as I said, a lot of discipline over the last year in terms of we were optimizing capital and we want to continue to do that. So the same expectations that we have for full relationships, the same expectations we have for our risk profile. So I think everything we're adding is just more accretive than what we were adding before based on our capabilities.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you so much, Bill. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Let's see, Mike, I wanted to just ask a little on the guide and the nuance. So if I understood it correctly, on an apples-to-apples basis, the full-year guide is the same for expenses, but tightened up to the low-end of a prior range as better fees are offset by slightly weaker NII outlook. So hopefully, I got that right. But within there, just curious for expanded thoughts on what has changed within the NII expectations. I imagine the preponderance of it is just fewer rate cut expectations with the 3% versus 6% previously, but maybe you could speak to other factors such as deposit mix or pricing nuance that might have impacted as well?\nBill Rogers: Yes. Scott, you made it easy for me. Those are the answers. So for us, we had five cuts back in January. I think the market had six. We're looking now at 3%. I think the market has 2% or fewer, frankly. And so I think maybe one nuance to our outlook is that we believe that sort of 4% to 5% manages three cuts or even fewer cuts than 3%. So perhaps worth noting there. And then beyond just the curve , we have just -- and I think our expectation in January, we were six months from the last hike and here we now sit at nine months, and we probably had an expectation that there'd be a touch less churn and pressure on pricing and mix on the liabilities portfolio side. So those are the two factors. And then, of course, we're seeing some strength on the fee side. So put that in the blender and 4% to 5% feels right.\nMike Maguire: Yes. It's Mike, as you know that does not include TIH repositioning. So we still have to say all this in the same setup [Multiple Speakers]\nScott Siefers: Yes, I totally understand. Thank you. And then, Mike, maybe just on sort of the competitive environment for funding. On the one hand, it's a general question, but also curious to hear your thoughts in so far as there are a lot of out of market competitors encroaching on your pretty attractive demographic markets. Just curious to hear -- just your thoughts on sort of rationality of funding pricing. Are they having a visible impact or is the market pretty rational as to what you would expect in a higher for longer environment? How are those things all projecting?\nMike Maguire: Yes. I mean, look, we -- one of the benefits of operating in such attractive high-growth markets is they're attractive to others as well. And so it's always been a competitive marketplace for us. But I don't think we're seeing -- I would -- what I would describe as irrational behavior in the market. I think we're at a little unusual moment in the cycle being as high as we are for as long as we've been here. And so you're seeing a variety of strategies, but by and large, I think people are all trying to solve the same problem we are, which is when will we perhaps see some relief on the rate side. Meanwhile, we're really just focused on supporting our clients, right? So we've got the right products we think, and the right client experiences. And we're going to pay a competitive rate to defend the relationships that you would expect us to defend.\nBill Rogers: It's also, Scott, why we focus on net new. So in addition to, sort of, the pricing within our existing portfolio, we want to make sure we're adding net new accounts. So our rate of acquisition has been really strong, and our rate of attrition has been improved. So those are important barometers for us to sort of look at the overall health of the franchise and our relative competitive positioning.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you all for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nKen Usdin: Hey, thanks, guys. Just wondering -- just in terms of sequencing and how we'll understand how the rest of the potential benefits look like following the close of the transaction. I guess just wondering, are you still anticipating a June 1 close? And then do you anticipate like just next earnings season, we'll kind of get the understanding of the full impacts of both cash reinvestment and whatever you may decide to do on restructuring?\nMike Maguire: Hey, good morning, Ken. It's Mike. We don't have a date certain on closing, but we have an increasing confidence that Q2, we will be able to complete the transaction. I think once we complete the transaction, we think there'll be an opportunity for us to communicate during the quarter, sort of, what things look like from there?\nKen Usdin: Okay, got it. And then just underneath the surface, I guess it's hard because by 3Q, you'll probably have done some of these things, but you mentioned NII down a little bit in the second quarter. Ex the deal, do you have a view of kind of where that core NII would be heading as we look into the second-half of the year and kind of when that gets to a stability point?\nMike Maguire: Yes, that's right. In the guide we gave for Q2 is sort of ex any cash or ex any potential benefit from a repositioning. So that's down 2% to 3% is I think what you're asking for at least in the quarter. And we do believe that the second quarter will be a trough for us. So if you think about the third quarter, a, I think we'll get a touch of benefit just on the, a, our baseline has us getting a cut in June. And if you think about the third quarter, maybe a cut and a half if you get September -- early September also. So you got to cut in a half, you've got one extra day in the third quarter and maybe a touch of a larger balance sheet if we start to see a little bit of loan growth come through. So we see some modest improvement in Q3 and the same -- and the same in Q4 sort of a baseline path. I think fewer cuts puts a little bit of pressure on that, but I think we still expect 2Q to be a trough from an NII perspective regardless.\nKen Usdin: Okay, great. Yes, it was a second-half point that I was looking for that incremental color on.\nMike Maguire: Yes.\nKen Usdin: Thank you on kind of how it improves. Okay, and then just one more follow-up on IB. You mentioned the investments you've been making at the quarter was outstandingly good. Are you kind of implying that flat fees in the second quarter that this is a new run-rate for IB and trading? Some other banks have talked about pull-forward in DCM, but I just want to kind of understand the color of where you think the puts and takes are for fee income growth from here? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Yes. I don't think there's been any particular pull forward. This was a particularly strong M&A quarter. M&A is a little less predictable on a quarter-on-quarter basis. But I think as we look sort of, if we're thinking short-term like next quarter, next couple of quarters, I mean, this seems to be a pace that we're operating at right now in terms of our momentum in pipelines.\nKen Usdin: Thanks very much, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Mayo: Hi, if I can just get one simple question and one more complex question. The simple question is, so you're guiding for a trough in NII in second quarter and that does not include any deployment of the $10 billion. So if you just put the $10 billion, say you get a 5% yield on that, then you get $500 million, that would add 2% to your year-over-year revenue growth. And also, how much would the sale of insurance improve your tangible book value?\nMike Maguire: The first question, that's right, Mike. The guidance really for the year-end, and specifically, you asked for the quarter does not include the benefit of the cash. We do expect the cash proceeds after tax to be about $10.1 billion. You know you can pick your forward curve deployment rate, but I think you're in the ballpark. And then your second question was what would be the tangible book value per share improvement from the sale, I think was the question and that would be by roughly, roughly a third.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then, Bill, for you, I know I brought this up before, but we're -- after five years, the announcement of this merger and at least five years ago, as of today, your stock is down one-fourth, the BTX is flat, the S&P is up two-thirds. And I'm looking -- I guess your annual meeting is tomorrow and you talk about leaning into your purpose, inspiring to build better lives. And I just don't see the word shareholder there or on that side. By the way, love purpose purpose-driven capitalism and I love how you bring that up. But I think if you don't bring shareholders along on that slide, you say happiness. I don't think the shareholders are too happy if they've been around for the last five years. So can you just pull the lens back the day before your Annual Shareholders meeting and say what you're doing to help make shareholders happy, assuming that your clients, employees, and communities are happy, how do you bring the shareholders along a little bit more? Thanks.\nBill Rogers: Thanks, Mike. So just to be clear in our mission statement, our shareholders are a key component of our stakeholders. So they've never been excluded in terms of -- in terms of -- in terms of our purpose. And I just fundamentally believe that purpose and performance are inextricably linked. So there's just no doubt about that. Do we lean in a lot to clients and teammates and communities during the first part of our merger and during COVID? Absolutely. Are we leaning in equally now with shareholders as a component of all that? Absolutely. And you see some of the actions we're taking, some of the momentum that we're creating. I highlighted in the beginning of this call sort of small business as an example of how purpose and performance are linked. So focus on our small business community heroes, which is great. That's very purposeful, help them build their businesses and help them build their communities, but also meant we added 8,600 of them and we created $700 million of deposits. So I do think they're linked, I think if you sat at our company and listened, you would understand that people make the connection very, very clearly and I'm not confused about that. And I think the actions that we've taken in the fall, the actions that we're taking now, the momentum we've created are solid evidence of our focus on our shareholders as well.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess...\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Maybe just Bill, following up on from a shareholder focus, I think there's a lot of focus around what this company can earn on a go-forward basis as we think about the turn-on tangible equity. Maybe you want to wait for a few months, I appreciate that till the deal closes. But give us a sense, when you look at sort of consensus numbers, 12% return on tangible equity, I'm assuming that's not kind of what you're aspiring for. So give us a framework when we think about your peer set, whether you think you can get there? And then just how quickly given maybe there's still some more tech spend to be undertaken over the next few years? Yeah, if you could start there. Thank you.\nBill Rogers: Yes, Ebrahim, I think I hopefully said very clearly that, that'd be a starting point. So that would not be an acceptable return for us long-term. It is a component of a reset. If you think about it, there are -- let me put it into a couple of buckets. So short and medium term, we have a chance to actually move that more demonstrably. So think about the share -- the securities repositioning sort of as a step one and share repurchase a little more meaningful to start with and more durable over time. So we have a short and medium-term unique capacity to increase that. And then long-term has to come from the growth of our business. And we're in the best markets, we are creating momentum in all those segments of our market. We're creating a lot of efficiency. So the -- every dollar of revenue is going to be more efficient in terms of how it produces income for our shareholders over time, and our ability to continue to invest. So you mentioned technology, but all those will be components. So the expenses are related to also our capacity to save money and invest in our company long-term. So short and medium-term, we get -- increase the slope a little bit and then long-term increase the slope over-time. It's a little too early for a sort of a specific target. You know, the target right now is to grow and again grow meaningfully. And as we understand the capital rules a little bit better, get through some of the capital planning, you know, we'll be in a better position to talk about more longer-term targets.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And Mike, just a quick one for you. So it sounds like few rate cuts is negative, but at the same time, the cash will make the balance sheet assets sensitive. With the cash, I mean, I'm just wondering if we have to -- if were to assume there are no rate cuts this year, is that really negative or more a neutral scenario given the cash will be sort of earning higher for longer in that backdrop? If you could clarify that, thank you.\nMike Maguire: Yes. Well, Ebrahim, what I was talking about was sort of a continuing ops guide, so ex the incremental cash. So we feel like there'd be downside, right? So our 4% to 5% contemplates three cuts baseline, but fewer cuts as well to the low side. I think if you added the cash, you're right, that would add asset sensitivity and that would just sort of transform our NII trajectory broadly. Obviously, when that asset sensitivity comes onto the balance sheet, we'll manage that consistent with how we've managed rate risk in the past, which is we will probably add some receivers to manage against lower rates longer. I think I answered your question, which is the guide is continuing ops ex-cash. We think the 4% to 5% has that in the cash and any repositioning benefit would be on top of that.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's good. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. What do you think is a good capital level to be running at kind of looking out medium-term, including AOCI?\nMike Maguire: Hey, Matt, it's Mike. I'll take a swing at that one. This is -- it's one that tough to get on the record on as you know, I think others are probably in the same boat. I think the good news for Truist is we find ourselves at least once we get our TIH transaction completed in a really strong I think on a relative and absolute basis capital position. You know, with the rules still in a proposal stage, I think it's really hard for us to determine exactly what a target might be. I think we do find ourselves in a position right now of some amount of excess capital. It's impossible to understand exactly what that level would be. But the good news again is, we do have the confidence in our current level such that we can shift from sort of a phase where we've been conserving capital to a phase where we're deploying capital and optimizing that capital and putting it to work and whether that's in the core balance sheet, which would be our first priority is to grow client relationships and balances and make money the old-fashioned way. You know, we obviously been clear that we think there's -- we have the capacity to evaluate a repositioning of the balance sheet. And of course, Bill has been pretty direct about our ambitions around buying back stock. So don't have a target for you, but our sort of tone and mindset and planning is oriented around growth.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. And then just -- I didn't see any disclosures, but remind me what the adjusted CET1 is right now? And again, obviously, you're picking up a lot in the deal, but what's the starting point right now?\nBill Rogers: We're at 10.1% as of the end of the quarter, which is flat to last quarter. You know, we've -- obviously the CECL phase-in impacted the linked quarter advancement. And if you fully phased-in the proposed rules, our AOCI would I think worsen that by a little over 3%, the thresholds a little less than 1%, and then RWA inflation maybe a couple, call it, 20 basis points, 30 basis points. So I think we're around 5.9%, maybe 6% on a fully phased-in basis today.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. And then obviously, off that 6%, we would add the 2.5% or 2.6% you said, so...\nBill Rogers: That's right.\nMike Maguire: Yes.\nMatt O'Connor: Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike.\nBill Rogers: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Mike, to follow-up on the bond potential restructuring. A technical question, are you guys permitted? I know you can restructure the AFS available-for-sale portfolio. But can you touch the held-to-maturity portfolio as well? And then second, if this Basel III, as we know appears to be delayed because of a big change coming, if Basel III doesn't get solidified and finalized until first or second quarter of next year, how does that impact your guys' decision-making on when to possibly do this restructuring?\nBill Rogers: Sure, Gerard. The first question, no, the HTM portfolio wouldn't be eligible for repositioning. We wouldn't be in a position to sell those securities or the consequences that we would have to mark the rest of the HTM securities. In terms of Basel, obviously, we've been engaged in the advocacy there as well. We've been monitoring the evolution of the rule. It does seem at this point that a final rule certainly is delayed versus our -- what we probably would have expected a year-ago or even six months ago. But I don't think we have an expectation that the substance of the rule that's going to be most relevant to Truist is likely to change, which is the inclusion of -- or the deduction of AOCI from regulatory capital. So I think we feel good about our path forward. And look, I mean, I think we were pretty clear in February again around our objectives with a potential repositioning. And just to sort of state it again, I mean, one, whatever we do, we want to make sure that we still have ample capacity to grow the business and execute on the buyback that Bill has mentioned. But it's really important to us to at least replace the TIH earnings in whatever we would -- whatever we would contemplate.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then possibly a follow-up on the commercial real-estate detail you gave us in the appendix. It looked like the non-performing loan percentage declined a bit from the fourth quarter, charge-offs, however, obviously went up, your reserves also went up relative to total loans. Any color that you guys can provide us on what's happening to the mix of the commercial real estate? You know, obviously, your office is the one that we're all focused on, but any other areas that you guys have some color would be great? Thank you.\nClarke Starnes: Yes, Gerard, this is Clark. We were very pleased in the quarter. To your point, we did see our total CRE, NPLs go down, and that was driven by deliberate actions we took to continue to work through, the stressed exposure in the CRE office. We actually reduced CRE office $222 million or 4.5% for the quarter, while addressing about $230 million worth of maturity. So as we've said before, we're not going to kick the can down the road. So we're trying to be very intentional about recognizing where we have exposure and going ahead and dealing with that. And that's what created the higher losses for the quarter, but the trade-off was lower NPLs. To your point, we also feel very good about our reserves. Our office reserves were increased to 9.3%. And also for the stressed more institutional style, we're nearly -- we're about 11.8%. So we're well reserved. I would say the other CRE segments are holding up really well. I know there's a lot of talk about multifamily. I'd say for us, what we see there is mostly a migration to the watchlist, but not to NPL or losses yet. And we're working with those borrowers and we're quite pleased that most sponsors are coming in and addressing, resizing if necessary, interest reserves, or other structural ways to keep those performing. So we feel good about the overall CRE book and our trajectory right now.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nVivek Juneja: Thanks. Hi, Bill. Hi, Mike. A couple of quick questions. One is the balance sheet restructuring that you're talking about. Any sense of timing in terms of how long is it -- do you expect you get done by assuming you close on June 1? Do you think you'd get done by end of this year or you think it ends -- heads over into '25? Are there any sort of tax reasons why you have any time limitations?\nBill Rogers: Maybe let me hit that [button] (ph), so I mean the spirit would be simultaneous. So that would be -- that would be the spirit in terms of you know, how we would -- how we would potentially restructure.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. And then, as you restructure Bill, are you thinking you'll replace the securities with other securities? Are you -- I know you're only going to get it to -- you want to get earnings to neutral. Where are you at this point thinking, are you willing to go more? What are you thinking in terms of ongoing run-rate of securities as a proportion of earning assets?\nMike Maguire: Yes. Hey, Vivek, it's Mike. I'll take it. In February, what we laid out was sort of an even redeployment into cash and securities. I think even that I think was hypothetical as you can imagine, we are keeping an eye on the market and thinking about the trade-offs around different, whether it'd be mortgages or treasuries and cash. So, I think we'll get that mix right and we'll be guided on not just earnings. Obviously, we have an objective of shortening the balance sheet and improving our, you know our readiness around what we think will be more rigorous liquidity requirements over time. And so that's actually one of the great benefits of this transaction or this collection of potential transactions is, it's not just about capital. This really does move us forward more broadly.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.\nBrad Milsaps: Okay. Thank you, Jamie. That completes our earnings call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free-to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest in Truist. We hope you have a great day. Jamie, you may now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Bill Rogers",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. So before we discuss our first quarter results, let's begin as always with purpose. We see that on slide four. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspire and building better lives and communities. And I'd like to share some of the ways we brought purpose to life last quarter. Our focus on small-business heroes is a great example of purpose-driving performance This strategy helps community heroes achieve their financial dreams and elevates their ability to support our neighbors and build strong communities. We're seeing great success with small business, evidenced by the addition of nearly 8,600 small business accounts during the quarter and $700 million worth of deposits. Our Truist Community capital team committed more than $252 million to support over 1,600 units of affordable housing, over 3,000 new jobs, and projects that will help empower almost 400,000 people in underserved communities over the next three years. Additionally, we announced the initial recipients of grants from the Truist Community Catalyst Initiative, which is a three-year Community Reinvestment Act program aimed at four key focus areas: Affordable housing, small business access to capital, workforce development, and essential community services. There are 17 community organizations receiving grants that will be used to support efforts in 54 communities across 13 states and allow local non-profit organizations to better respond to critical community needs within their states. Lastly, we published our 2023 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability report this month, which I encourage you to read and learn more about our progress in building better lives and communities. In all of these examples, our core belief is evident. We're leaders in banking and we are unwavering in care. All right, so let's turn to some of our key takeaways on slide six. First, I need to state and remind everyone that our first quarter and for the previous periods have been restated to reflect the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This change has no impact on our net income available to common shareholders. The restatement does remove TIH's revenue and expense from our financial statements as net income from TIH has now been reported as net income from discontinued operation. Mike is going to provide a lot more details around that later in the call. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 a share, which excludes a $0.04 per share impact from the industry-wide FDIC special assessment, and a $0.05 per share impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale. Pre-tax restructuring charges of $70 million negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.04 per share. So despite a few discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we saw a significant increase in investment banking and trading revenue, driven by strong performance across much of our capital markets platform with particular strength in M&A and equity capital markets. Loan demand continues to remain relatively muted, but we did see some improvement in our commercial lending pipelines during the quarter. On the consumer side, we recalibrated several of the capital-conserving strategies we deployed last year, prior to announcing the sale of TIH. This resulted in an increase in loan applications and in March, we saw the first increase in balance since October of 2022. Second, our results show our expense discipline and continued focus on managing cost. As a result of these efforts, adjusted expenses increased by less than 1% linked quarter and decreased by 4% on a year-over-year basis. Although, the linked-quarter rate of expense growth will increase in the second quarter relative to the first, we are fully committed to delivering our expense objectives in 2024, which excluding TIH should now result in adjusted expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024 versus 2023. Our asset quality continues to normalize of historically low levels, but we're pleased that non-performing loans remained relatively stable and the net charge-offs were within our expectations. Finally, during the quarter, we also announced that we'll be sell -- we'll sell our remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which is on track to close in the second quarter. The sale of TIH will significantly strengthen our relative capital position, which will create substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses. In addition, as we discussed in February, our stronger capital position affords us an opportunity to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities post-closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning designed to at least replace TIH earnings. The sale of TIH also positions us to resume share repurchases. The timing and size of repurchase activity will be -- will depend on our ongoing capital planning, market conditions, clarity around final capital rules, and other factors. But our goal is to resume a program that's both meaningful and durable. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail, I want to provide a quick update on the progress we're making and improving experiences for our clients, which we see on slide seven. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities. In the first quarter of 2024, mobile app users grew 8% and digital transactions increased 13%, compared to the first quarter of last year. Though activating teammates -- through activating teammates to educate clients on our capabilities, transactions continue to shift towards self-service capabilities with 77% of the deposits occurring through these channels, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions. Recently, we rolled out Zelle QR code widget, where users can quickly access their QR codes from their home screens to seamlessly assist with bank transfers. At Truist, we aim to make banking simple and easy for our clients through thoughtful enhancements to their experience. Enhanced offerings coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher retail digital client satisfaction scores. These scores surpassed pre-merger highs as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our T3 strategy. Overall, I'm proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital and optimistic about the opportunity to expand our digital user base and drive self-service transaction volume. So with Mike -- with that Mike, let me turn it over to you to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Great. Thanks, Mike. I am proud of the results our teammates delivered during the first quarter, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum, and the announced sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. As Mike mentioned, TIH will enter its partnership with its new investors with strong momentum as evidenced by its first quarter results. Providing risk advice to our clients is core to our purpose, we look forward to maintaining a strong partnership with that team into the future. We have great confidence in our capability to grow our core banking business and help our clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer, payments, investment banking, and wealth platform throughout existing footprint, and specialty areas. Our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged and include growing and deepening relationships with core clients, maintaining our expense discipline, evaluating various capital deployment options following the sale of TIH, and enhancing Truist's digital experience through T3, all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. Our expense discipline is showing up in our results, which gives us confidence that we'll meet our expense objectives this year. I'm also encouraged by the improvement in our wholesale banking business, which includes investment banking and trading as it was a key driver of our quarterly results. In investment banking, we've increased our market share across several capital market products due to significant investment in talent and industry verticals. These investments have resulted in significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products, including equity capital markets, leveraged finance, asset securitization, and M&A. In addition, our mind share with clients in our key industry verticals has never been stronger and we continue to expand into new verticals that are primed for growth as capital markets activities recover. We are seeing solid year-over-year growth in referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver value-added advice and capabilities to our clients. Our commercial teammates have responded to new expectations and we continue to add great talent to our comprehensive platform. And finally, we made new key leadership hires within our payments business during the quarter as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time. In consumer, I'm encouraged that our internal consumer satisfaction scores have returned to pre-merger levels. In addition, net new checking account production was positive in the first quarter as we added 30,000 new consumer and business accounts. Importantly, we're also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates. Also during the first quarter, our digital channel, we acquired 172,000 accounts, including 63,000 new to Truist, while also seeing a 14% increase in deposit balances over the fourth quarter of 2023. While the branch network represents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets, we continue to see improvements in productivity due to teammate execution and investments in technology. We're encouraged by this increased productivity, we'll look to make investments in branches and select key growth markets in 2025. Overall, loan demand does remain muted, but I'm encouraged by the improvement in our commercial loan pipelines and the growth we witnessed in consumer balances late in the first quarter. By selling TIH, we'll have capital capacity to play more offense in our consumer and wholesale businesses, which includes seeking ways to accelerate loan growth in our core franchise. In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet will be positioned to weather an even wider range of economic environments, while also giving us the unique ability to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities post-closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning and resuming meaningful share repurchases later in the year. Although we have a plan to replace TIH earnings in the near-term, we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. Our starting point for ROTCE following the sale of TIH will be exactly that, a starting point. The strength of our markets, our core banking franchise, our capital deployment options we can consider after the sale will result in improved returns over time. We'll move with pace, but we'll not be in a rush to deploy capital to meet short-term expectations that don't have a long-term positive impact on our company, our clients, our shareholders, especially since Basel III capital rules have not been firmly established for the industry. So in conclusion, we're off to a solid start in 2024, but we acknowledge, as always, there's more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future. We view our first quarter performance as another step forward in that direction. I'm optimistic about our future, I look forward to operating our company from this increased position of financial strength in some of the best markets in the country. And finally, I'd like to thank all of our teammates and our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity, particularly over the last few months during this important time for both TIH and for Truist. So with that Brad, let me hand it back over to you for Q&A. I'll go into the others, and as you said, John, I mean, we're in a different rate environment, so we'll evaluate all the other alternatives that exist with that, and there's some things that have some shorter paybacks that I think should be evaluated in that alternative. And then also we have some tax efficiency as it relates to this. So we have some unique components of doing this in line with the TIH sale. And then you mentioned sort of what are the other capital deployment options? You know obviously, the first and foremost for us is growth in our business. I mean sort of investing in our business. You saw in this quarter some of the things we did on the consumer side where we leaned in a little bit. Quite frankly, we think some of the margins are still strong in those businesses. So that, what we're adding is a little more accretive than it would have been in the past. The risk profile has been strong. So we have the capacity to dial some of that up on the consumer side. And then on the wholesale side, just our relevance is more important. So what we're -- we don't want to give up all the discipline. We created a lot of discipline around pricing and around structure and again, what we're adding today is much more accretive. So we'll continue to pursue opportunities in our markets and through our industry verticals and we've got good momentum in that front. And then lastly, on the share repurchase side, we're going to--we'll be back in the share repurchase business, that will be part of the portfolio. As I mentioned before, we're going to do all this with pace. So I think it would be -- you know, reasonable to assume we'll have some type of meaningful share repurchase sort of -- sort of short, medium-term, and then longer-term, and just a more durable consistent share repurchase plan. So it's a combination of all those things factored into the equation, which give us, as I said before a lot of optimism about being able to improve those returns short-term, importantly, but most importantly over the long-term. Betsy, good morning, and welcome back. Great. Great to hear your voice. Yeah. And I did note it because it's a little bit different. So in the fourth quarter, we started seeing pipelines decrease a little bit. And here in the first quarter, we've seen pipelines improve, particularly on the commercial side. You know, how they get to execution and how they get to finalization will depend on a lot of market conditions. But the good news is clients are -- they're having the discussions, they're having the debate about the new warehouse or the new fleet of trucks the things that they want to do to continue to expand their businesses. But most importantly, we're just more relevant. I mean, we're just more relevant in those discussions. I mean, the activity that we've been able to create in terms of new relationships, I mean, almost 60% of the activity that we added in the quarter were new relationships. So new to Truist. So I think a lot of it's at pitch activity is up, all the things we're doing, new left leads are up. So I think it's some combination of a little bit of the markets that we operate, probably a little more optimistic than the rest of the country. Our investments that we've made, products, capabilities, and our overall relevance with our clients. So we're talking to them about things they want to listen to, they want to talk about, and I think we're just better-positioned than we've ever been. Betsy, you get extra permission. Yes, exactly. Yes, so on the auto side, maybe to compare and contrast, it's not rack for us, it's sort of our core prime auto business in terms of growth. And again, just being able to be a little more relevant to our dealers, and creating a little more capacity, you've seen lots of changes from people in and out of the auto side. We like the consistency of it. And again, we have a deep strong relationships with lots of dealers and this just adds to that portfolio. And then on the corporate side, same thing on the -- if the question was related to the risk profile, similar kind of risk profile, I mean, we're -- we created, as I said, a lot of discipline over the last year in terms of we were optimizing capital and we want to continue to do that. So the same expectations that we have for full relationships, the same expectations we have for our risk profile. So I think everything we're adding is just more accretive than what we were adding before based on our capabilities. Yes. Scott, you made it easy for me. Those are the answers. So for us, we had five cuts back in January. I think the market had six. We're looking now at 3%. I think the market has 2% or fewer, frankly. And so I think maybe one nuance to our outlook is that we believe that sort of 4% to 5% manages three cuts or even fewer cuts than 3%. So perhaps worth noting there. And then beyond just the curve , we have just -- and I think our expectation in January, we were six months from the last hike and here we now sit at nine months, and we probably had an expectation that there'd be a touch less churn and pressure on pricing and mix on the liabilities portfolio side. So those are the two factors. And then, of course, we're seeing some strength on the fee side. So put that in the blender and 4% to 5% feels right. It's also, Scott, why we focus on net new. So in addition to, sort of, the pricing within our existing portfolio, we want to make sure we're adding net new accounts. So our rate of acquisition has been really strong, and our rate of attrition has been improved. So those are important barometers for us to sort of look at the overall health of the franchise and our relative competitive positioning. Yes. I don't think there's been any particular pull forward. This was a particularly strong M&A quarter. M&A is a little less predictable on a quarter-on-quarter basis. But I think as we look sort of, if we're thinking short-term like next quarter, next couple of quarters, I mean, this seems to be a pace that we're operating at right now in terms of our momentum in pipelines. Thanks, Mike. So just to be clear in our mission statement, our shareholders are a key component of our stakeholders. So they've never been excluded in terms of -- in terms of -- in terms of our purpose. And I just fundamentally believe that purpose and performance are inextricably linked. So there's just no doubt about that. Do we lean in a lot to clients and teammates and communities during the first part of our merger and during COVID? Absolutely. Are we leaning in equally now with shareholders as a component of all that? Absolutely. And you see some of the actions we're taking, some of the momentum that we're creating. I highlighted in the beginning of this call sort of small business as an example of how purpose and performance are linked. So focus on our small business community heroes, which is great. That's very purposeful, help them build their businesses and help them build their communities, but also meant we added 8,600 of them and we created $700 million of deposits. So I do think they're linked, I think if you sat at our company and listened, you would understand that people make the connection very, very clearly and I'm not confused about that. And I think the actions that we've taken in the fall, the actions that we're taking now, the momentum we've created are solid evidence of our focus on our shareholders as well. Good morning. Yes, Ebrahim, I think I hopefully said very clearly that, that'd be a starting point. So that would not be an acceptable return for us long-term. It is a component of a reset. If you think about it, there are -- let me put it into a couple of buckets. So short and medium term, we have a chance to actually move that more demonstrably. So think about the share -- the securities repositioning sort of as a step one and share repurchase a little more meaningful to start with and more durable over time. So we have a short and medium-term unique capacity to increase that. And then long-term has to come from the growth of our business. And we're in the best markets, we are creating momentum in all those segments of our market. We're creating a lot of efficiency. So the -- every dollar of revenue is going to be more efficient in terms of how it produces income for our shareholders over time, and our ability to continue to invest. So you mentioned technology, but all those will be components. So the expenses are related to also our capacity to save money and invest in our company long-term. So short and medium-term, we get -- increase the slope a little bit and then long-term increase the slope over-time. It's a little too early for a sort of a specific target. You know, the target right now is to grow and again grow meaningfully. And as we understand the capital rules a little bit better, get through some of the capital planning, you know, we'll be in a better position to talk about more longer-term targets. We're at 10.1% as of the end of the quarter, which is flat to last quarter. You know, we've -- obviously the CECL phase-in impacted the linked quarter advancement. And if you fully phased-in the proposed rules, our AOCI would I think worsen that by a little over 3%, the thresholds a little less than 1%, and then RWA inflation maybe a couple, call it, 20 basis points, 30 basis points. So I think we're around 5.9%, maybe 6% on a fully phased-in basis today. That's right. Good morning. Sure, Gerard. The first question, no, the HTM portfolio wouldn't be eligible for repositioning. We wouldn't be in a position to sell those securities or the consequences that we would have to mark the rest of the HTM securities. In terms of Basel, obviously, we've been engaged in the advocacy there as well. We've been monitoring the evolution of the rule. It does seem at this point that a final rule certainly is delayed versus our -- what we probably would have expected a year-ago or even six months ago. But I don't think we have an expectation that the substance of the rule that's going to be most relevant to Truist is likely to change, which is the inclusion of -- or the deduction of AOCI from regulatory capital. So I think we feel good about our path forward. And look, I mean, I think we were pretty clear in February again around our objectives with a potential repositioning. And just to sort of state it again, I mean, one, whatever we do, we want to make sure that we still have ample capacity to grow the business and execute on the buyback that Bill has mentioned. But it's really important to us to at least replace the TIH earnings in whatever we would -- whatever we would contemplate. Maybe let me hit that [button] (ph), so I mean the spirit would be simultaneous. So that would be -- that would be the spirit in terms of you know, how we would -- how we would potentially restructure."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mike Maguire",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our financial statements for the first quarter and for previous periods have been restated due to the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This restatement has no impact on our net income or earnings per share for historical or current reporting periods. However, and as you can see on our financial tables, revenue and expense associated with TIH is no longer shown on our financial statements. TIH's contribution to Truist net income and earnings per share is now captured in net income from discontinued operations. My comments today will focus on revenue and expense from continuing operations, although I will also provide some detail on revenue and expense for the quarter inclusive of TIH for comparative purposes. We reported net income available from continuing operations of $1 billion or $0.76 per share, which includes a $75 million pre-tax or $0.04 per share after-tax expense related to the industry-wide FDIC special assessment. We reported net income available from discontinued operations, which represents earnings from TIH of $64 million or $0.05 per share, which includes an $89 million pre-tax or $0.05 per share negative impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale. So on an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 per share, which includes adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.80 and adjusted net income from discontinued operations of $0.10. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $70 million in the quarter, which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.04 per share. The bulk of these charges were related to severance and real-estate rationalization. Total revenue, which excludes revenue associated with TIH, decreased by 1.4% linked-quarter due to a decline in net interest income, partially offset by stronger non-interest income led by investment banking and trading. Revenue before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 0.2% on a linked quarter basis. Adjusted expenses, which excludes adjusted expense associated with TIH, increased by 0.7%. Adjusted expenses before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked quarter basis. Next, I'll cover loans and leases on slide nine. Average loans decreased 1.3% sequentially, reflecting overall weaker client demand and our decision to deemphasize certain lending activities during 2023, which impacted growth during the first quarter. Average commercial loans decreased to 0.9%, primarily due to a 1.2% decrease in C&I balances due mostly to lower client demand. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased 2%, primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage. During the quarter, we did increase our appetite for high-quality indirect auto loans, which as Bill mentioned, resulted in consumer loan balances showing positive growth for the month of March. Overall, we expect average loan balances to decline modestly in the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter. Moving to deposit trends on slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1.6% sequentially as growth in client time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in non-interest-bearing brokered and money market balances. Approximately $1.9 billion of the $6.3 billion linked quarter decline in average deposits was due to lower brokered deposits. Adjusting for broker deposits, our average deposits declined approximately 1%. Non-interest bearing deposits decreased 4.9% and represented 28% of total deposits, compared to 29% in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the quarter, consumers continued to seek higher-rate alternatives, which drove an increase in deposit costs. Specifically, total deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially to 2.03%, which resulted in a 2% increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 38%. Similarly, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially to 2.82%, which also resulted in a 2% increase in our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta of 53%. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 4.2% linked quarter, primarily due to higher rate paid on deposits, lower day count in the quarter, and lower average earning assets. Reported net interest margin declined 7 basis points on a linked quarter basis, due primarily to higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to non-interest income on slide 12. Non-interest income increased $83 million or 6.1% relative to the fourth quarter. The linked quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher investment banking and trading income, which was up $158 million linked quarter, due to strong results across much of our entire capital markets platform with specific strength in M&A and equity capital markets. Lending-related fees decreased $57 million linked-quarter due to lower leasing-related gains. Non-interest income increased 1.8% on a like-quarter basis, as higher investment banking and trading, wealth, and other income were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit and mortgage banking income. Next, I'll cover non-interest expense on slide 13. GAAP expenses of $3 billion decreased $6.6 billion linked quarter, as fourth quarter 2023 expenses were negatively impacted by a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge, a $507 million FDIC special assessment, and $155 million of restructuring charges primarily related to our cost-savings initiatives. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense increased 0.7% sequentially. The increase in adjusted expense was driven by higher personnel expense of $156 million due to normal seasonal factors and higher variable incentive compensation, partially offsetting the increase in personnel expense were lower other expenses, which declined $82 million, reflecting lower operating charge-offs and lower pension expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses before the impact of discontinued operations, accounting -- discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked quarter basis. On a like quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined $120 million or 4.2%, reflecting lower headcount and continued expense discipline. Moving to asset quality on slide 14. Asset quality metrics continue to normalize in the first quarter, but overall remained manageable. Non-performing loans remained relatively stable to linked-quarter, while total delinquencies were down 6 basis points sequentially, driven by a 7 basis point decline in loans 30 to 89 days past due. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.7% of total loans. However, we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 8.5% to 9.3% during the quarter to reflect continued stress in this sector. We expect stress to remain in the office sector, but believe that the size of our office portfolio is manageable and well reserved. Approximately 5.5% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing, but 89% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. During the quarter, our net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 64 basis points. The increase in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects increases in our CRE and consumer portfolios, offset by lower C&I and CRE construction losses. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.56%, up 2 basis points sequentially, and 19 basis points on a year-over-year basis due to ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we've tightened our risk appetite in select areas that we maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality long-term clients. Turning now to capital on slide 15. Truist's CET1 ratio remained relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis at 10.1%, as organic capital generation and the impact of lower risk-weighted assets were mostly offset by the impact of the CECL phase-in that occurred during the quarter. We still anticipate the sale of TIH will generate approximately 230 basis points of CET1 under current rules and 255 basis points of CET1 capital under proposed Basel III endgame rules. It will also increase our tangible book value per share by 33% through a combination of a $4.8 billion after-tax gain and the deconsolidation of $4.7 billion of goodwill and intangibles from our balance sheet. The divestiture of TIH has a 255 basis point positive impact under the fully proposed phase-in Basel III endgame rules, which is 25 basis points higher than under current rules. The larger impact on our CET1 ratio under the proposed rules is due to the reduction in certain threshold deductions due to the overall higher level of capital from selling TIH. The sale of TIH accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry. And importantly, creates capacity for Truist to evaluate a wide variety of capital deployment alternatives, including growing our core banking franchise during a time when much of the industry is conserving capital, repositioning our balance sheet, and resuming share repurchases. As it relates to a possible repositioning, recognizing securities losses under proposed Basel III rules would have no impact on our fully phased-in CET1 ratio since current proposed rules include AOCI in the calculation. Moreover, any decision to sell market value securities has no impact on our tangible book value per share. I will now review our updated guidance on slide 16. First, all of my comments today related to second quarter and full-year 2024 guidance exclude any benefit from interest income that Truist will earn on the $10.1 billion of after-tax cash proceeds that we expect to receive from the pending sale of TIH. Our guidance also excludes any impact from a potential balance sheet repositioning that we plan to evaluate post-closing. In addition, revenue and expense guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024 is based on revenue and expense from continuing operations and does not include any contribution from TIH in previous or in future periods. Looking into the second quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to decline about 2% from 1Q '24 GAAP revenue of $4.9 billion. Net interest income is likely to be down 2% to 3% in the second quarter due to continued pressure on rate paid and a smaller balance sheet. We expect non-interest income to remain relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis. Adjusted expenses of $2.7 billion in the first quarter are expected to increase 4% in Q2, due to higher professional fees, some timing of projects delayed from Q1, higher marketing costs, and annual merit increases. For the full-year 2024, we previously expected revenues to be down 1% to 3%, which would have included revenue from Truist Insurance Holdings. If we had excluded revenue from Truist Insurance Holdings from our outlook, our expectation would have been closer to down 3% to down 5% in 2024. Today, we are tightening our previous revenue guidance adjusted for TIH of down approximately 3% to down 5% to now down approximately 4% to 5% to reflect the latest interest-rate outlook and continued pressure on the deposit mix, partially offset by our improved outlook for non-interest income. Our outlook assumes three reductions in the Fed Funds rate with the first reduction coming in June 2024. Previously, we assumed five reductions in the Fed Funds rate with the first reduction occurring in May 2024. We still assume that net interest income will trough in the second quarter of 2024 and modestly improve in the second-half of the year. Fewer than three rate reductions would add pressure to our NII outlook and result in our annual revenue coming in at the lower end of our range for revenue to be down 4% to 5%. As a reminder, our second quarter and full-year revenue outlook excludes any benefit from interest income earned on the cash proceeds from the sale of TIH or the benefit of potential balance sheet repositioning. As Bill mentioned, we still expect the sale of TIH to be completed during the second quarter. We previously expected our expenses to remain flat or to increase by 1% in 2024, which included expenses associated with Truist Insurance Holdings. If we had excluded expected expenses from Truist Insurance Holdings from our outlook, our expectation would equate to expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024. Consistent with our previous expense outlook adjusted for TIH, we expect full-year \u201824 adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over 2023 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion. In terms of asset quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a taxable equivalent basis. Our estimated tax rate excludes any impact from the gain on the sale of TIH or a potential balance sheet repositioning that we might consider following the sale. So now I'll turn it back to Bill for some final remarks. Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. Look, I mean -- we're certainly taking a look at the market rate environment and I'd say just the framework that we shared back in February, we remain committed to, right? And, so we laid out a set of objectives that spanned maintaining a relative capital position, at least replacing the earnings from TIH, we also have ambitions around advancing our liquidity and ALM position. So the rate environment and we talked about that in February is a touch different than what we're looking at today, but we think still, you know, actionable and so we -- our plans to evaluate repositioning after we complete the sale are still intact. I mean, if you look at the short-end of the curve, certainly, we see probably a little bit of benefit relative to what we talked about from a cash reinvestment perspective, and the same goes if you think about reinvestment rates on the bonds, but on the other hand, you do have the trade-off of a slightly higher realized loss in that instance. Yes. I mean, a lot of it obviously is from market improvement, but as you noted, I mean, we've been investing in this business for quite some time, particularly over the last several years. You know, our existing team has really set horizon to the challenge. They're working really great with the commercial team. So we're seeing all the pull-through from our franchise, we've brought 30 plus new MDs into our -- into our business. So these are teammates with great expertise and great access. So I think it's a combination of all those things and we're really confident. I mean, we're confident heading into the second quarter and the rest of the year about the momentum in this business. Hi. Yes. It's Mike, as you know that does not include TIH repositioning. So we still have to say all this in the same setup [Multiple Speakers] Yes. I mean, look, we -- one of the benefits of operating in such attractive high-growth markets is they're attractive to others as well. And so it's always been a competitive marketplace for us. But I don't think we're seeing -- I would -- what I would describe as irrational behavior in the market. I think we're at a little unusual moment in the cycle being as high as we are for as long as we've been here. And so you're seeing a variety of strategies, but by and large, I think people are all trying to solve the same problem we are, which is when will we perhaps see some relief on the rate side. Meanwhile, we're really just focused on supporting our clients, right? So we've got the right products we think, and the right client experiences. And we're going to pay a competitive rate to defend the relationships that you would expect us to defend. Hey, good morning, Ken. It's Mike. We don't have a date certain on closing, but we have an increasing confidence that Q2, we will be able to complete the transaction. I think once we complete the transaction, we think there'll be an opportunity for us to communicate during the quarter, sort of, what things look like from there? Yes, that's right. In the guide we gave for Q2 is sort of ex any cash or ex any potential benefit from a repositioning. So that's down 2% to 3% is I think what you're asking for at least in the quarter. And we do believe that the second quarter will be a trough for us. So if you think about the third quarter, a, I think we'll get a touch of benefit just on the, a, our baseline has us getting a cut in June. And if you think about the third quarter, maybe a cut and a half if you get September -- early September also. So you got to cut in a half, you've got one extra day in the third quarter and maybe a touch of a larger balance sheet if we start to see a little bit of loan growth come through. So we see some modest improvement in Q3 and the same -- and the same in Q4 sort of a baseline path. I think fewer cuts puts a little bit of pressure on that, but I think we still expect 2Q to be a trough from an NII perspective regardless. Yes. The first question, that's right, Mike. The guidance really for the year-end, and specifically, you asked for the quarter does not include the benefit of the cash. We do expect the cash proceeds after tax to be about $10.1 billion. You know you can pick your forward curve deployment rate, but I think you're in the ballpark. And then your second question was what would be the tangible book value per share improvement from the sale, I think was the question and that would be by roughly, roughly a third. Yes. Well, Ebrahim, what I was talking about was sort of a continuing ops guide, so ex the incremental cash. So we feel like there'd be downside, right? So our 4% to 5% contemplates three cuts baseline, but fewer cuts as well to the low side. I think if you added the cash, you're right, that would add asset sensitivity and that would just sort of transform our NII trajectory broadly. Obviously, when that asset sensitivity comes onto the balance sheet, we'll manage that consistent with how we've managed rate risk in the past, which is we will probably add some receivers to manage against lower rates longer. I think I answered your question, which is the guide is continuing ops ex-cash. We think the 4% to 5% has that in the cash and any repositioning benefit would be on top of that. Hey, Matt, it's Mike. I'll take a swing at that one. This is -- it's one that tough to get on the record on as you know, I think others are probably in the same boat. I think the good news for Truist is we find ourselves at least once we get our TIH transaction completed in a really strong I think on a relative and absolute basis capital position. You know, with the rules still in a proposal stage, I think it's really hard for us to determine exactly what a target might be. I think we do find ourselves in a position right now of some amount of excess capital. It's impossible to understand exactly what that level would be. But the good news again is, we do have the confidence in our current level such that we can shift from sort of a phase where we've been conserving capital to a phase where we're deploying capital and optimizing that capital and putting it to work and whether that's in the core balance sheet, which would be our first priority is to grow client relationships and balances and make money the old-fashioned way. You know, we obviously been clear that we think there's -- we have the capacity to evaluate a repositioning of the balance sheet. And of course, Bill has been pretty direct about our ambitions around buying back stock. So don't have a target for you, but our sort of tone and mindset and planning is oriented around growth. Yes. Yes. Hey, Vivek, it's Mike. I'll take it. In February, what we laid out was sort of an even redeployment into cash and securities. I think even that I think was hypothetical as you can imagine, we are keeping an eye on the market and thinking about the trade-offs around different, whether it'd be mortgages or treasuries and cash. So, I think we'll get that mix right and we'll be guided on not just earnings. Obviously, we have an objective of shortening the balance sheet and improving our, you know our readiness around what we think will be more rigorous liquidity requirements over time. And so that's actually one of the great benefits of this transaction or this collection of potential transactions is, it's not just about capital. This really does move us forward more broadly."

            "content": "Yes, Gerard, this is Clark. We were very pleased in the quarter. To your point, we did see our total CRE, NPLs go down, and that was driven by deliberate actions we took to continue to work through, the stressed exposure in the CRE office. We actually reduced CRE office $222 million or 4.5% for the quarter, while addressing about $230 million worth of maturity. So as we've said before, we're not going to kick the can down the road. So we're trying to be very intentional about recognizing where we have exposure and going ahead and dealing with that. And that's what created the higher losses for the quarter, but the trade-off was lower NPLs. To your point, we also feel very good about our reserves. Our office reserves were increased to 9.3%. And also for the stressed more institutional style, we're nearly -- we're about 11.8%. So we're well reserved. I would say the other CRE segments are holding up really well. I know there's a lot of talk about multifamily. I'd say for us, what we see there is mostly a migration to the watchlist, but not to NPL or losses yet. And we're working with those borrowers and we're quite pleased that most sponsors are coming in and addressing, resizing if necessary, interest reserves, or other structural ways to keep those performing. So we feel good about the overall CRE book and our trajectory right now."
