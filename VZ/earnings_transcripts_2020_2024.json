At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder we were in the quite period for spectrum auction 107. So we will not be able to comment on our midband spectrum holdings or strategy at this time. Now let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $4.30 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $523 million. This includes a net charge of $404 million primarily related to severance, including voluntary separations under our existing plans and the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities as well as a net loss of $119 million primarily related to the disposition of the HuffPost business. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.21 in the fourth quarter and $4.90 for the full year. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impact to earnings from the adoption of Accounting Standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition is illustrated for comparability purposes and reflects a reduction in the benefit realized due to the deferral of commission expense versus the prior year. We also continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of COVID on our business. The year-over-year impacts of both ASC 606 and COVID were not significant in the fourth quarter. The full year 2020 impacts from ASC 606 and COVID were $0.09 and $0.21 respectively on both a reported and adjusted earnings per share basis. We do not expect the adoption of ASC 606 to have a significant impact on the comparability of 2021 results to 2020. Full year adjusted EPS growth of 1.9% illustrate on the earnings waterfall slide reflects the strong underlying performance of the business. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2020.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and Happy New Year to all of you. First of all, 2020 was a challenging year and I can only say that I\u2019m super proud how Verizon responded to the changing environment during 2020. And we supported our customers, our employees and society in a way that I\u2019ve never seen before. So, all in all, a great year. At the same time, we executed well on our strategy and so that we had really good financial performance as well. When it comes to our 2020 strategic priorities, let me walk through the execution of them. First of all, strengthening and grow the core business, I\u2019m really proud to announce that we continue to have the best network in the nation. We just got for the 15th time the overall best network with RootMetrics on all seven different categories. That includes 5G, which is so important to us that we continue to have that lead. I'm also happy to announce that we won for the 26th consecutive time the J.D. Power\u2019s award. It tells a lot about our network and technology team, how they have been building a network and how we continue to lead this market. When it comes to the customer innovation, you have seen us working with our customers to give them richer offering, and also even better performance on the network. This year with Disney+, Discovery+, also adding in the iPhone 5 from Apple has, of course, supported a lot of innovation that we're doing in the Verizon Consumer Group. And we see a great migration of our customers to unlimited and to the premium unlimited. Finally, you can see also that Verizon Business Group has a year on investments to see that we are putting a foundation to be much stronger for the future had good growth in the wireless, and also in some areas like the public sector, very good performance and also adding local new customers on the enterprise side. When it comes to us leveraging the assets to drive new growth, the commitments we did in February 2020 when it comes to 5G were all met or exceeded. I'm extremely happy with that. We now have 64 Ultra Wideband cities. We are more than 10 cities on our home 5G Ultra Wideband, we have 10 Mobile Edge Compute centers public with Amazon. All in all, we deployed more than 5x more Ultra Wideband sites during 2020. And we launched the nationwide 5G that now is covering 230 million POPs in 2,700 cities. On the financial side, a strong year ended where we had more than 2% growth in the wireless service revenue. We also have growth on our EPS in the fourth quarter, over 7%. We had an operational cash flow full year of $41.8 billion, which is a growth of 17%. A very strong year that put us in a good position while going into 2021. And finally, we\u2019ve a really large focus on how to include all our four stakeholders in the work we are doing. And I\u2019m really proud of the Citizen Verizon that we launched during last year, which is a great way for us to see that the society aspect is part of our strategy, where, of course, our focus on being carbon neutral is very important; and the second green bond was launched at the second half of 2020. So, all in all, I\u2019ve to say, it was a very different year, but a great execution where we hit all our strategic milestones at the same time as we pivot and supported all our stakeholders. At the November sell-side event, I presented the five vectors of growth. Those are the vectors that is based on our strategy of Network-as-a-Service. Those are also the enablers for us to get to GDP plus. We have great traction on them, and we also have done quite a lot in 2020, all the way from the 5G adoption to the customer differentiation that I talked a lot about, the new markets that we are addressing still pending the acquisition of TracFone, but we have other segments we are addressing, as well as the next-generation business-to-business application based on our unique Mobile Edge Compute offering that we have with Amazon, also now with Microsoft and many other partners. And finally, the network monetization with our MVNO partners, which are enjoying the best network that we have and we are building. All in all, this is built on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that we outlined some 3 years ago and giving us the opportunity to have great execution in the future. With that, I would like to hand over to Matt to go through the financials in a little bit more detail.\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I\u2019m with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020. In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless service revenue growth and strong results in Verizon Media Group were offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline products. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.7 billion as compared to $11.1 billion last year, a 5.3% increase driven by service and other revenue growth and disciplined spending.  Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year, including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. Our continued focus on our Business Excellence program has resulted in realized cumulative cash savings of $9.5 billion, and we are well positioned to achieve our $10 billion goal ahead of our year-end 2021 target. COVID has brought about new ways of working, and we believe some of these will be long-term in nature. This will create additional savings opportunities beyond the current program. As Brady mentioned, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.21, up 7.1% from $1.13 a year ago. We are pleased to report 1.9% growth of full year adjusted EPS at the high end of our revised guidance, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business. Let\u2019s now turn to cash flow results on Slide 8. Our cash generation was exceptionally strong in 2020, reflecting our subscription-based business model and the quality of our customer base. This enabled us to continue to execute on our capital allocation model, investing in our business, increasing our dividend for the 14th straight year and strengthening our balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $41.8 billion for the year, an increase of $6 billion from the prior year, driven by continued performance and strength in the business, lower tax payments due to a one-time cash tax benefit received earlier in the year and reductions in working capital primarily due to lower wireless volumes. Capital spending in 2020 totaled $18.2 billion, as we continued to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network and launching our nationwide 5G network. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $23.6 billion, up 32.4% year-over-year. Throughout the year, we opportunistically diversified our debt portfolio, optimized our cost of borrowing and retained a higher level of cash as a result of the pandemic. We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.3 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.0x versus our targeted range of 1.75x to 2.0x. We remain committed to our capital allocation model. Now let\u2019s review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 9. Our competitive position is based on compelling unlimited plans that provide choice to consumers, paired with the best devices and attractive promotions, all built on the country\u2019s best network. This quarter, we launched our nationwide 5G service to coincide with the release of the iPhone 12 line up, which fully supports our Ultra Wideband offering, enabling Verizon customers to utilize a full range of connectivity provided by this iconic device. Partnerships remain a critical component of our value proposition. We recently added Discovery to our list of existing successful partnerships, which includes Apple and Disney. As the early cohort of Disney+ customers have come off of the initial free 12-month period, more than two-thirds have maintained their subscription, either through their Verizon Direct billing relationship or by opting into one of our newest Mix & Match plans with the Disney bundle included. Volume activity in the quarter was tempered by consumer behavior, given rising COVID cases and elevated store closures that limited foot traffic in addition to the retention offers in the market. As a result, the pool of consumers switching carriers was lower than a year ago. Fourth quarter phone gross adds were down approximately 24% year-over-year, relatively consistent with declines experienced in the third quarter. We are pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting, as over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan, and over 55% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 60% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 20% of our base taking a premium plan. Our customer retention remains high with phone churn of 0.76% for the quarter, down 7 basis points from a year ago, contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 163,000. Disconnects related to customers in our Stay Connected program totaled more than 135,000 phones in the quarter. Our Stay Connected program continued to see great results with approximately 95% of customers making a payment since entering the program, and collection cure rates are in line with our expectations. More than 50% of all customers in the program are current on their payments. December was the final month of service billings for the program, and payment activity remained stable, though we will continue to closely monitor payment trends in 2021. Turning to Fios. We continue to build on our strong third quarter with consumer Fios Internet net additions of 92,000, more than double the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Fios Internet net additions of 95,000 was the best fourth quarter we have had since 2014 and reflected strong demand for our gigabit offering as consumers continue to work and learn from home. Cost cutting trends continued, resulting in consumer Fios Video net losses for the quarter of 72,000. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $23.9 billion, down 1.2%. This was primarily driven by a 3.8% decline in wireless equipment revenue due to softer volumes in the quarter. For the full year, total Consumer revenue decreased 2.8% to $88.5 billion driven by the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.6 billion, a 1.2% increase. The results reflect the resilience of our business as we recovered from a 2.7% decrease in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we delivered ARPA growth of 1.8% year-over-year, even as TravelPass and other usage fees remain at subdued levels, demonstrating that our tiered approach to unlimited provides a strong foundation for delivering revenue growth. For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $53.6 billion, relatively flat from 2019 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.8 billion, a 2.5% decline from a year ago. Customer credits related to regional sports networks negatively impacted Fios revenue by 4.2% in the quarter and also reduced our content expense. We expect Fios revenue to benefit as growth in the broadband base offsets the impact of the shift from the triple-play bundle to stand-alone service. Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.9% to $9.9 billion. Margins were 41.5% in the quarter, up 160 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 45.5%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year, including an impact of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. Now, let\u2019s move to our Business segment on Slide 11. Business wireless trends remained resilient throughout the year and the fourth quarter was no different. Public sector demand remained strong on the success of our distance learning program and support for increased needs of state and local government agencies. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, while we experienced modest pressures in enterprise. Business segment fund gross adds for the quarter were down 11% from the prior year due to store closures and continued economic weakness. Segment postpaid phone churn was 0.98% in the quarter, which was down 2 basis points over the prior year. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 116,000. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 12, to review the Business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment were $8.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down slightly year-over-year. Full year operating revenues of $31 billion, represented a decline of 1.5% from the prior year. Wireless service revenue in the quarter accelerated to 7.1% year-over-year from 4.9% in the third quarter, which was more than offset by reductions in wireless equipment volumes and secular pressure on legacy wireline products. Looking at wireless service revenue, public sector had a particularly strong quarter and small and medium business growth improved for the second straight quarter, although it was still below pre-pandemic growth rates. Legacy wireline product trends appear to be normalizing after initially benefiting from the transition to a work-from-home economy. The growth in advanced communication services continues to drive opportunities for the segment. While we are pleased with the revenue performance of the Business segment and exit 2020 with momentum, there are uncertainties around how businesses will perform in 2021 given the challenges within the macro environment. The elevated demand experienced in public sector and parts of enterprise throughout 2020 could potentially create headwinds to growth in the Business segment, particularly in the back half of 2021. Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, up 390 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the strength in wireless service revenue and the benefits of our transformation initiatives, including back office digitalization and optimization. Full year margins of 25.4% were up slightly versus last year. Now let\u2019s move on to Slide 13, to discuss Verizon Media Group. We are very pleased with Verizon Media Group performance. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up approximately 11% from a year ago, the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends with demand-side platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year. Advertising strength came from political, consumer products, technology and retail, among other verticals. The fourth quarter also saw continued high consumer engagement in commerce as offline to online shopping behaviors continued through the holiday season on our owned and operated properties. In particular, mail e-commerce revenue growth was 7x that of the prior year, and we saw continued strength in finance and news as daily active users grew 52% and 11%, respectively. Let\u2019s now move on to Slide 14 for a quick look at overall wireless performance. Key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segments are illustrated on this slide. Total wireless service revenue was up 2.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 0.7% for the full year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website. Now let\u2019s focus on our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We are excited to deliver 2021 expectations that include accelerating revenue and earnings growth driven by our five growth vectors as wireless service strengthens and 5G continues to scale. This year, we are providing an outlook for service and other revenue, which includes revenues from across all of our businesses, but excludes wireless equipment revenue given its variability, especially in the current environment. For 2021, we expect service and other revenue growth of at least 2%, reflecting an acceleration of total wireless service and Fios revenue growth as well as continued momentum in Verizon Media, partially offset by ongoing legacy wireline product declines. Included in this outlook is total wireless service revenue growth of at least 3% driven by our tiered unlimited plans, new customer contributions and ongoing strength in business. For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings per share of $5 to $5.15 driven by recurring service and other revenue growth as well as ongoing cost initiatives. We assume no significant year-over-year impact from below-the-line items based on the 2021 opening balance sheet. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%. Our consolidated capital spend for full year 2021 is expected to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, consistent with the prior year and within our normal capital intensity range. Our focus for the year includes further expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in new and existing markets, densification of our network to manage future traffic demands and continued deployment of our fiber infrastructure. Our cash flows in 2021 are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by taxes and working capital. We anticipate that our cash taxes in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, given expectations for higher pre-tax income this year and a one-time $2.2 billion cash tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2020. Working capital was a tailwind in 2020 due to the lower equipment volumes, which we do not expect to repeat in 2021. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our 2021 priorities.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. Let me review the 2021 priorities based on the four pillars of strategic priorities, starting with the core business. And as you heard Matt talking about accelerating the service revenue, I\u2019m pleased that we are guiding for a plus 3% wireless service revenue growth in 2021. That\u2019s based on that we will continue to differentiate our value proposition for customers. We also will continue to invest in our Verizon Business Group to capture that potential we see in the Business segment with a new platform that we are developing together with our customers. When it comes to our 5G and investing in our business, we have a big year in front of us in 2021. Again, we are going to almost double the amount of 5G Ultra Wideband sites. We are going to have 14,000 new sites coming in during 2021. That will enable us to continue to increase with plus 20 cities when it comes to 5G Ultra Wideband. And we are also going to add some plus 20 5G Home cities, at the same time, focusing very much on the 5G Mobile Edge Compute with 10 more sites when it comes to the public side. And then on the private side, we will scale that network together with the demand that has come as we know already, all underpinned with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and the fiber that we are deploying. When it comes to the financial, Matt talked about that we continue to focus on to accelerating the earnings per share growth, now with guidance of $5 to $5.15 earnings per share. The year 2020 solidified our balance sheet, and we will be continued focused on the cash flow generation. And finally, when it comes to our culture and our purpose, we have very much focused on the customer-centricity and the brand strength that we have built in the market. That will continue, as well as we will have also the Citizen Verizon totally included in the overall strategy. You see that we are managing all the four stakeholders that is making the success for Verizon in the future. So very clear, a year of execution. We have progressed one more year on the Verizon 2.0. We are in a great position. I\u2019m really excited to go into 2021. I\u2019m pleased to announce that we will have our normal Investor Day in the early part of 2021. We will come back with the exact date in due time. And by that, I would like to hand over to Brady for Q&A.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. We are -- Brad, we are now ready to take the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys, thanks. Two, if I can. First, Hans, can you talk about the strategy of revenue growth from here given the higher promotional environment? Is it important that you grow accounts or can you make the revenue growth on the existing base? And clearly, you're looking for customers to move up to premium unlimited. Where is that next now? And then second, where are we on the fiber builds and how should that start to come through in revenue and expense management this year? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Phil. Let me start by the subscribers then. I mean, first of all, we came into the third quarter already, I mean, we have our model with the migration of customers, giving them a better network and a better experience, and that is really how we are managing our base and we came with a good momentum in the third quarter. And so in the fourth quarter, we had service revenue growing more than 2%. That we said also in the guidance. That's so important for us because we have a model where our net addition is part of our strategy, how we move them up. And as Matt said, we have now more than 60% of our customers on unlimited, but more important, I mean, if you look in the fourth quarter, 90% of the new net adds took unlimited, and out of those 55 to premium. And the premium is of course where we are at the end of 5G we're adding in Discovery+, Disney+ the way that our -- that Ronan and his team has worked in with these migration path and we believe and as you heard in the guidance that Matt talked about, we believe that we can continue that work with the organic service -- wider service revenue growth with a model we now have, and we have proven the model over the years. And let's also remember the business side has performed very well when it comes to the wireless account. I mean, we are so strong with the public sector with large enterprises on the wireless side. So that is giving us a lot of positives going into 2021, with the guidance we\u2019ve of continued service revenue growth on the wireless side. And we will constantly measure what actions we're taking, but we feel good about it. When it comes to the fiber question, yes, we continue to roll out fiber. We're probably in the year three or four right now. We -- I would say, we -- the majority or vast majority of all the 5G sites they have our own fiber. We are migrating our 4G sites where it's a good return on investment t our own fiber. And over time, we will also open up opportunities for resell to our -- to enterprise customers and wholesale. So I think that we are seeing that benefit already on the 5G build, because we are using our own fiber. To get the full impact, we also have a couple of years left in order to have it in all the areas. But we are coming far away on a fiber build and we will continue to do it where it makes sense from a return on investment. So we feel really good about that and that\u2019s part of our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Phil.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we will move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. I think you called out in the release that COVID ended up being a $0.02 benefit in the quarter. I imagine that was probably a mix of things that were good and bad. So can you maybe could give us a little bit of insight into that. And then the EPS guidance that you gave for this year, what are you assuming about the COVID impacts over the course of this year? If you could give us any insight of how that breaks out? And then also one last question on guidance. Does that factor in any potential future spectrum purchases? Or is it just reflect the portfolio spectrum you have today? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the last question, and Matt can come back to the first. So when it comes to our guidance for EPS in 2021, of course, there are uncertainties of the pandemic and so on. But some things we know, I mean the roaming charges will continue to be a headwind. We also think that as the pandemic and economic recoveries is coming back, probably latter part of '21, the public sector will not have an equally strong year as they had in 2020. We also believe the SMB will continue to be subdued and have a challenge in '21. And as we saw, during the full year, the switch pool has been lower due to the traffic in the stores et cetera. So that that's we are factored in. But on the other hand, we have line of sight to what we're doing because we're executing on a strategy when it comes to migration of our customers. What we're doing in Verizon Business Group and also Verizon Media Group, as Matt said, they were now for the first time ever have a year-on-year growth of 11%. All in all, that is giving us the confidence that we can live up to this guidance. But there are some uncertainties and there are some headwinds from COVID, but we think that with those assumptions we have we can actually do this. And this is a continued work with the EPS growth and acceleration that we've talked about for so many years right now. And we continue to show that we can do with the assets we have and how we're executing. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say was certainly some level of pressures will continue to exist on the business throughout the year. I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic, but we're not overly optimistic either. We assumed some level of pressures that you saw from the second half of the year, our ability to still execute within that type of environment. In terms of the fourth quarter, as you say, there was actually the COVID impact was actually a $0.02 benefit. And what you saw there was a couple of one timers, but primarily it was a case of the revenue pressures we saw declining versus what we'd seen in 2Q and 3Q. You think you -- media as an example, which had been significantly hit by COVID impacts earlier in the pandemic, but certainly no impact in 4Q as we recorded that 11% revenue growth there. So those revenue -- some of the revenue headwinds moderated in the fourth quarter, the expense benefits continued. That's why you saw the $0.02 net benefit, which actually completely offsets the $0.02 headwind from 606. So, if you kind of think about in the fourth quarter, 606 and COVID have a no net impact on the results, and that $1.21 stands on its own the 7% increase on a year-over-year basis.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: All right. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you. Good morning. Hans, I wonder if you could talk about 5G monetization in 2021. You mentioned the expansion of the network, the Ultra Wideband Network, more 5G home locations, more Mobile Edge Compute. So can you just take us through both on the Consumer side, particularly 5G Home and on the B2B side, what we should be looking for and what you're kind of including in your forecast for '21?\nHans Vestberg: Yes, absolutely. We are excited about the 5G in 2021. I mean, on the mobility side, we're already seeing monetization happening. I mean in the fourth quarter, with so many customers taking the premium and going for unlimited, that's sort of where we have our sweet spot with the 5G. And, of course, with the Apple iPhone right now in 5G that has now kicked off that, so that you will see through the year when it comes to our mobility case. When it comes to 5G Home, we\u2019ve very solid progress in 2020, came out with this new CP, we added some 12 cities, now with 5G Home with the NR technology. And our plan is doing a 20 plus markets more in 2021. So now we're starting to get a solid foundation for the 5G Home. And as you heard in my remarks, I mean, we're doubling the amount of sites almost in 2021. So, we're now getting to a very, very solid positioning there. But I said before on the Ultra Wideband deal, we're building it mainly in the very dense urban areas and then in stadiums, et cetera in the beginning. So we covered less of houses or residential in the beginning. But as these continue right now, we're capturing more and more. So I'm really excited. We also know that the CPE is really good so and the self-install is working well. So we're looking forward to seeing that happening over the year more and more. On the 5G Mobile Edge Compute, we have a great funnel of customers on the Business side. And we are not expecting that will be in significant revenues into '21, but you're going to see a lot of customers signing up for the 5G Mobile Edge Compute both the private and the public in '20 -- in '21, in order for us to have a very solid base going in to '22. So, a lot of excitement around 5G. I think we have built it absolutely right. We have an opportunity in front of us that we have been working on for a couple of years right now. So, I'm happy with my sales team. I'm happy with the technology team, and we have a big year in front of us.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. I got three quick ones. First, in terms of the 3% plus service revenue growth, can you give us a sense in terms of whether that's weighted more towards subs or ARPA improvement? Obviously, you guys in your commentary talked about some of the headwinds to the sub growth. I\u2019m just wondering if you guys think you can maintain sub growth as you look through the year? That's number one. Number two, just any thoughts on the ability to continue to drive margin improvement in the business, given that considering you're close to achieving the $10 billion in savings. And then lastly, sort of a follow-up to Brett's question, is the CapEx guide that we've heard, is that something that could be revised during the year if the circumstances change? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Let me start, I mean, on the 3% growth, I think we have our strategy when it comes to how to grow with the migration of customers and all of that. And as always, the team is validating how to make offerings, if we should be more aggressive or not, but we always think about do long-term positive impacts for our shareholders financially. And you have seen us now working for the last 2.5 years since we launched unlimited, we are doing the right things in order to make a long-term impact positively for shareholders and for our customers. And so especially Ronan and the team, they\u2019ve quite a lot in the portfolio, but we have now proven that this model is working when it comes to migration of unlimited with the best network and adding in also new value-added services, everything from Disney+, the Discovery+, Apple Music and it might be more coming up in the year as well. So, I'm confident that guys have that in the portfolio. And as you heard about the Disney+, it's -- I think it's just unheard of how we can help the direct to consumers. I mean, two thirds are signing up or more than two thirds are signing up to continue to service after 1 year. I don't -- I think that is something standing out. On the EBITDA, Matt will come back later on, but I can say that we continued with efficiency. And it's the reason why we are giving a guidance that we will grow the EPS again, and the majority or all of it is basically above the line, as Matt said. So this is operational improvements, and improvements as we are growing our top line. Again, we have proven the model, the five vectors of growth and now we're in the middle of executing. And finally, on CapEx. This is what we need to do right now. We -- the technology team has all the means to have to execute on a strategy with assets we'll have to date. The only thing I can say, as I said, I'm not sure how many times before. We will only increase CapEx if we find something that has a really good return on investment. And then we'll come back and talk about it. Right now, we have everything that we need to execute the plans that we have in front of us.\nMatthew Ellis: Hey, John, so back to your couple of questions around the guide. As you think about the 3% service revenue, it's really a combination of subs and ARPA. Hans, obviously talked through all of the things that will drive the opposite side of the equation. But we certainly do expect subs growth, account growth, and net add growth is important to our business as well. We will do that in a disciplined way. We're not going to chase unprofitable growth, but you should expect to see volume growth in the business as well as ARPA growth. And then the margin improvement, cost savings where, as you mentioned, we're close to the achieving the $10 billion program well ahead of the end of 2021 timeline that we put in place. But just because we hit that doesn't mean we -- it doesn't mean we'll stop. There is significant opportunities to continue to make our business more efficient. The teams are very focused on those. And you know that the $10 billion goal won't change us -- won't slow us down at all from continuing with that. As you think about margin improvement, obviously, revenue will be a big driver of that. And then you combine that with the cost savings. The one thing I would say is, as we have an improvement in EBITDA margin dollars, if we have equipment revenue increase this year, which we would certainly be glad to see an indication of the overall economic activity picking up, you'd see an impact of that in the EBIT margin. So you could have EBIT dollars grow, but margins not grow as much just because of the impact on the numerator and denominator from the equipment revenue. But we're certainly very much focused on the dollar side of that equation, and excited with the guide we have for the year.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, John. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Hans, I guess the first question for you just on the strategy side with the sale of the HuffPost. Is this the beginning of a dismantling of the Verizon Media business? Is it on the block? What is the game plan for that unit as we think longer term for Verizon? And then, I guess the second question would be for Matt. Matt, you called out that the 2H '21 might have some tough comps for the business side of the business. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on what that might be and what the numbers might look like? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. On the Verizon Media Group, I just want to remember you that we started this journey somewhere in 2018, resetting the overall strategy of Verizon Media Group. We started with that. We started to take out cost. We changed the product portfolio. We went into a very clear brand value of trust and privacy. The team has just done an outstanding job. I mean, they have bringing this from sort of going down with a decrease in growth of 15% to 20% per quarter. And now they're turning around with extremely sharp products as including also consolidating some, I'm not sure if it was 10 or 15 different ad tech platforms to one. I think it's great. We have put them in a position that we are really happy with. So, I'm looking for how these guys will execute, and we are now in the position where I wanted it to be.\nHans Vestberg: And then, David, on your question on the VBG volumes. So certainly, as you think about what we've seen this year, especially in the public sector part of Verizon Business Group, very, very strong year. Obviously, some of that is due to the circumstances that we've seen across the country. So I would actually be very happy if we saw some pressure on those volumes in the second half of the year. That would mean good things were happening elsewhere that would be very supportive of our Consumer business, very supportive of our SMB businesses as well. So certainly, it's part of some of the uncertainty that exists as we think about the year, but just wanted to call out the fact that if we see the improvements we expect, we may see the -- some impact there on the public sector side of our Verizon Business Group volumes. But as I say, I think that would be more than offset by other parts of the business. So, what you've seen and what we expect in '21 is a continuation of what you saw in 2020 is that as we have so many different parts of the business, irrespective of how the macro environment plays out, we can put together very strong consolidated results.\nDavid Barden: Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. I wonder if we could just talk about the competitive environment in wireless for a moment. Your gross additions remain, especially in Consumer, but across Consumer and Business, way down. Your churn rate remains very good and your ARPU shows signs of improving. That's sort of a different story than what we've seen for the last few years, which it sort of speaks to perhaps a moderation of competitive intensity, but clearly a weakening of your ability to acquire new subscribers. I wonder if you could just talk about that for a bit and talk about how you see that evolving in the 5G era as we -- particularly now that more and more of the handsets that are being sold are 5G handsets?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. First of all, I think the competitive landscape is always there and competition is also equal. I think that we just have a little bit different strategy. I mean, first of all, quality net adds is for us very, very important. And as you can see, we are adding this very important net adds. We want quality customers that likes our network, that likes our offerings and our experience. And if you look at what we have done in the last 2.5 years with our migration story, that's exactly what we have done. And that's what you see an impact in the fourth quarter. We are growing our service revenue as well as the guidance for next year. So we are confident with the strategy we have, and that might not be the same strategy that others have, that we can grow. And that's part of the five growth vectors we have to get to GDP plus. And with the guidance that Matt gave or we gave with plus 3% on the wireless service revenue, I think we have all the confidence in the model we have and how we'll work with. But it's also true that the switcher pool during 2020 in the fourth quarter was lower due to COVID, less traffic and all of that. So -- but all in all, we are very pleased with the high-quality net additions that we are getting and that we can create growth with that and continues on. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. Craig, I think the retention side of the business is performing very, very well and we are doing that through the quality of the network, the quality of the customer experience and not having to do anything additional to drive that type of retention numbers that you see. So, it's been a very strong story there, and we would expect that to continue.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks. And if I could just squeeze in one more question if I could, because -- and sorry to change topics. But your video strategy seems to be now quite different in wireline and wireless. In wireless, you're clearly with Disney and Discovery. You're sort of playing the Switzerland neutral arms dealer. I wonder if it raises any questions about for Fios. Does it make sense to stay in the video business as you currently have it, where you're still selling a direct package, or would it make sense to move to a similar strategy for the wireline side, where you sort of offer more third-party aggregators, if you will, across your network?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. No, first of all, you're absolutely right. On the wireless side, our D2C strategy is great. We have a platform that nobody else, when it comes to distribution, brand and network, and we can cope with this. We are not going to have 100 different type of offerings. But the discovery+, the Disney+, they are sort of super A brands that we want to work with or Apple Music. We will look for more of these to see that they're fitting into our customer base, that they like it and are willing both to upgrade and migrate. So, we will continue with that. On the Fios side, of course, we will continue with the video right now. But you\u2019ve seen us also starting with Mix & Match, starting to shop up this because ultimately, I want our customers to have choices. And I want them to choose. If they want the D2C solution or if they want a linear or they want over-the-top, they should be able to choose it. And look at the numbers in the fourth quarter again. We continue to grow our Fios Internet customers and we have a decline in the video customers. That's good for us, I mean, financially. But ultimately, it is to meet our customers' needs. And I think the whole setup that we did in Verizon 2.0 is just catered for us to do things that we never thought about before. We have a Consumer division thinking about how are we now delivering to consumers and that's what you see in the numbers. That's what you see in the numbers that we have. We have the same in Verizon Business Group. They are thinking totally different we have done before. And we still have more to do with platforms and things to be even more scalable and be able to bring more to the bottom line. But I have to say, I'm pleased and I hope that you guys, what you see, are pleased as well. I mean the strategy is working. We have the five vectors of growth. We are going into 2021, we have proof points on all those five, including the video strategy you asked about.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Craig. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, if you look at the improvement in postpaid churn year-over-year, can you unpack what portion of that might be coming from the pandemic and the lower switcher pool versus what's coming from the Verizon initiatives on the network strategy, the tiering and content bundling that you're doing or any other factors that you think may be improving retention? And then secondly, on the wireline business, is there at some point down the road a step function opportunity to take margins up, especially as you've continued to fiberize the local footprint? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I will start and will let Matt make some comments as well. But on the postpaid churn, I think that we are just having a great moment with our customers. They love our network and the performance we have and the additions we're doing with 5G and 5G Ultra Wideband. At the same time, our all offerings are so distinct and different than anybody else in the market, where they can go to the unlimited premium together with Discovery+ or Disney+ or Disney+ Plus, Plus. We have ESPN and Hulu included. I think nobody else has those type of things in the market. And our partners, at least if you ask them, I think you should, are very happy and pleased on how we can deal with this. We are happy with it, both from a retention but also from a bottom-line side. We were making money on this, which is the whole idea with the Network-as-a-Service that we're building on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. On the wireline side, I think the whole idea of the Verizon Business Group is really to see that we are working these year-over-year. This is nothing that you fix in a month or a quarter or two. This is things that we need to invest in a billing system, direct-to-consumer, call centers, everything being set up to deliver scalable platforms for our customer in the Business side. That will, over time, improve our margins in the Verizon Business Group. And I think that if you look at 2020, I mean, it was a good performance of them, still doing investments in order to get where we want to get over time. And then we add to that new opportunities, like 5G Mobile Edge Compute. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So just back on the postpaid churn, Mike, for a second. Certainly, there is a pandemic contribution, but as Hans mentioned, a lot of Verizon specific pieces too. I'd also point out that the fourth quarter churn number included the impact. If you think about the Stay Connected customers, there was a delay in those customers going all the way through a collections process and so on. And so, you had a positive benefit from that in Q2 and 3Q, a little bit of a catch up in 4Q. But even with that, a very strong churn number, and it's just based off of the best network experience as you saw confirmed again by RootMetrics yesterday. When you put that together with everything else we do, customers who get on the Verizon network want to stay on the Verizon network.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you so much. Hans, I just wondered -- I was hoping you reflect back on the arrival of 5G in the United States and the prompt is, like a lot of people thought the iPhone 12 being the 5G and having all your bands in it would start a bit of a super cycle or not a bit of one, but a super cycle for consumers adopting 5G in the United States. I'm just curious how much of it sort of not happening in that way as due to the pandemic and the lack of getting people to retail versus the lack of applications that would really just sort of delight consumers and get them to upgrade? And how you think that\u2019s going to evolve over the next year or two or three? Is it going to be sort of a slow walk, or is there something exciting around the quarter?  And then for Matt, I'm just curious, beyond working capital, any other free cash flow swing factors for 2021? And is there any way to size or quantify working capital? It's kind of hard to tell looking historically what normal might be. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: When we talk about devices and what's happening with the upgrades and so on, I mean, remember also that the Apple 5G phone came out, I would say, late in the fourth quarter, that's when this all started, at the same time as we had the pandemic. Still, I would say we are very pleased what we\u2019ve seen with our customer migrating to 5G. Remember, we have a fair share or a big share of Apple users in our base. So, I think that this is a pretty normal, maybe some little bit subdued, but it's very normal upgrade cycle that we will see. And 5G will just getting better and better. I mean, that's what's happening. I mean, we are fortifying our network, we're improving the performance constantly. I remember when I talked about Ultra Wideband reaching maybe one gigabit per second, now we're up to four, five. So there's so much more to do. And the same goes for our nationwide, improving all the time, performance better. So, I think that is coming together as the accessibility to phones are coming out much more and all the main brands have a 5G phone and all of them with Ultra Wideband. So, I think that we will see that continuing into '21 and '22. But there are longer cycles today when it comes to customers migrating to new phone. They're very attached to it. But I think this is no different than 4G cycle. I think we actually are -- this is going faster than the 4G cycle. It's just that our memories are so short, so we don't remember that. But clearly, this is equal to, too better than what we saw in the 4G cycle that happened some 10 years ago, which I refer to myself when I talk about my memory, so nobody else. Okay, Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Hans. So on, the cash flow question, Doug, so when you talk about the swing factors, obviously, it starts with higher earnings for the year. Above the line earnings will be obviously the largest driver in the cash flow for 2021. In terms of things that potentially go the other way from a cash flow standpoint, we would expect obviously higher earnings will lead to higher cash taxes. But in addition to that, we had the $2.2 billion one-time cash tax benefit in the second quarter last year that obviously won't repeat. So that will be a year-over-year difference in the cash flow. And then working capital, as you say, the biggest item in working capital is going to be in the receivables side, predominantly on the handsets. Obviously, as volumes go down, the amount of device payment contracts with customers we are doing goes down as well. So, even if we don't see an uptick in volumes this year, if they're just flat year-over-year, you have the removal of that tailwind from last year. So, all in all, you're going to see the increase from higher earnings with some offsets from cash taxes and hopefully on the equipment receivables side are going to be the key factors in there.\nDoug Mitchelson: All right. Thank you, both.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Doug. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Supino of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nPeter Supino: Hey, good morning. I wondered if you could discuss the service revenue outlook, and specifically within Consumer, the incremental margin characteristics of the service revenue growth that you expect? How -- do you expect that revenue to be any more or less profitable than a normal level of service revenue?\nHans Vestberg: I think that was outlined -- the guidance for 2021, we are looking for profitable growth. And that is how Verizon has worked as long as I recall. Now I haven't been here all my life, but we work with profitable growth. And that is in the Consumer group as well. We will see that we have the best offers for our customers and we will manage our P&L at the same time and we will be aggressive, if it's needed, to get long-term effects. But as you can see from the guidance, it's a profitable growth we're looking for. We should be able to both grow as well as making that a profitable growth and that's in the guidance.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So, Peter, I think that's exactly it. If the 3% plus service revenue guide is going to drive -- is driving the EPS growth, that's in the guide as well. So certainly, it's profitable growth. In terms of comparing it to historical incremental revenue, I think there is obviously different components all the time. But absolutely, everything that we're doing to step customers up from a revenue standpoint also creates incremental lifetime value with those customers. So, you should expect that to be a continuation of how we approach the marketplace that we bring customers on, and we do it in a way that creates significant economic value for us over the long-term as we provide best-in-class experiences for those customers. Nothing changes there in our mindset.\nPeter Supino: That's a great explanation. Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Hey, Brad, we've got time for one more question. Let's do one more, if we have somebody on the line.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Just want to circle back on CapEx for a moment. I feel like messaging earlier in the year was that CapEx in 2021 would be up. And if you look at Street expectations, they were indeed expecting CapEx to be up in '21 versus '20. So, I'm just trying to get a sense what might have changed to have the CapEx guidance flat year-over-year? Secondly, Biden is proposing increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%. I'm curious how you think about that and whether that would have a huge impact on free cash flow and dividend coverage? Or do you think that there will be offsets that you would be able to kind of absorb much of that increase? And then just as a housekeeping, is TracFone included in your 2021 guidance? Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So thanks, Colby. Maybe I'll go in reverse order there. We -- while we expect TracFone to close in the second half of the year, our guidance is -- it doesn't assume any significant impact on the EPS during the year. But we will update that if necessary, during the year. Corporate taxes, our assumption, as you heard in the guide, 23% to 25%, that's where we've been the last few years. Obviously, we do our outlook based off of what is on the legislative books. And so, we do it based on what's there right now. We look forward to seeing how the new administration works on a number of different issues. And if that changes the way we look at the business going forward, we will obviously talk about that at the appropriate time. But we are very confident in the business. Look, we had good dividend coverage when we had a much higher tax rate not too many years ago. So while we certainly believe that the current rate has been very helpful in job creation and in economic growth creation, we are certainly very comfortable with how our business is set up as the administration is looking at different things. And in terms of CapEx, I think what you're seeing is a very efficient capital deployment model within the Company. That's why you see a guide that's in line year-over-year as we continue to do all of the things that we've done, whether that be on LTE, the 5G build. You heard Hans talk about our goals for the Ultra Wideband build this year, continuing the fiber build out. And so, I think the team has got a very good momentum going there. As they've got more into those things, the efficiencies continue, that's why you see the guide where it is.\nColby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Colby. Let me hand it back over to you, Brad, and we'll close up the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I'm with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020. In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless service revenue growth and strong results in Verizon Media Group were offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline products. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.7 billion as compared to $11.1 billion last year, a 5.3% increase driven by service and other revenue growth and disciplined spending.  Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year, including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. Our continued focus on our Business Excellence program has resulted in realized cumulative cash savings of $9.5 billion, and we are well positioned to achieve our $10 billion goal ahead of our year-end 2021 target. COVID has brought about new ways of working, and we believe some of these will be long-term in nature. This will create additional savings opportunities beyond the current program. As Brady mentioned, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.21, up 7.1% from $1.13 a year ago. We are pleased to report 1.9% growth of full year adjusted EPS at the high end of our revised guidance, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business. Let's now turn to cash flow results on Slide 8. Our cash generation was exceptionally strong in 2020, reflecting our subscription-based business model and the quality of our customer base. This enabled us to continue to execute on our capital allocation model, investing in our business, increasing our dividend for the 14th straight year and strengthening our balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $41.8 billion for the year, an increase of $6 billion from the prior year, driven by continued performance and strength in the business, lower tax payments due to a one-time cash tax benefit received earlier in the year and reductions in working capital primarily due to lower wireless volumes. Capital spending in 2020 totaled $18.2 billion, as we continued to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network and launching our nationwide 5G network. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $23.6 billion, up 32.4% year-over-year. Throughout the year, we opportunistically diversified our debt portfolio, optimized our cost of borrowing and retained a higher level of cash as a result of the pandemic. We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.3 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.0x versus our targeted range of 1.75x to 2.0x. We remain committed to our capital allocation model. Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 9. Our competitive position is based on compelling unlimited plans that provide choice to consumers, paired with the best devices and attractive promotions, all built on the country's best network. This quarter, we launched our nationwide 5G service to coincide with the release of the iPhone 12 line up, which fully supports our Ultra Wideband offering, enabling Verizon customers to utilize a full range of connectivity provided by this iconic device. Partnerships remain a critical component of our value proposition. We recently added Discovery to our list of existing successful partnerships, which includes Apple and Disney. As the early cohort of Disney+ customers have come off of the initial free 12-month period, more than two-thirds have maintained their subscription, either through their Verizon Direct billing relationship or by opting into one of our newest Mix & Match plans with the Disney bundle included. Volume activity in the quarter was tempered by consumer behavior, given rising COVID cases and elevated store closures that limited foot traffic in addition to the retention offers in the market. As a result, the pool of consumers switching carriers was lower than a year ago. Fourth quarter phone gross adds were down approximately 24% year-over-year, relatively consistent with declines experienced in the third quarter. We are pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting, as over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan, and over 55% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 60% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 20% of our base taking a premium plan. Our customer retention remains high with phone churn of 0.76% for the quarter, down 7 basis points from a year ago, contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 163,000. Disconnects related to customers in our Stay Connected program totaled more than 135,000 phones in the quarter. Our Stay Connected program continued to see great results with approximately 95% of customers making a payment since entering the program, and collection cure rates are in line with our expectations. More than 50% of all customers in the program are current on their payments. December was the final month of service billings for the program, and payment activity remained stable, though we will continue to closely monitor payment trends in 2021. Turning to Fios. We continue to build on our strong third quarter with consumer Fios Internet net additions of 92,000, more than double the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Fios Internet net additions of 95,000 was the best fourth quarter we have had since 2014 and reflected strong demand for our gigabit offering as consumers continue to work and learn from home. Cost cutting trends continued, resulting in consumer Fios Video net losses for the quarter of 72,000. Now let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $23.9 billion, down 1.2%. This was primarily driven by a 3.8% decline in wireless equipment revenue due to softer volumes in the quarter. For the full year, total Consumer revenue decreased 2.8% to $88.5 billion driven by the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.6 billion, a 1.2% increase. The results reflect the resilience of our business as we recovered from a 2.7% decrease in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we delivered ARPA growth of 1.8% year-over-year, even as TravelPass and other usage fees remain at subdued levels, demonstrating that our tiered approach to unlimited provides a strong foundation for delivering revenue growth. For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $53.6 billion, relatively flat from 2019 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.8 billion, a 2.5% decline from a year ago. Customer credits related to regional sports networks negatively impacted Fios revenue by 4.2% in the quarter and also reduced our content expense. We expect Fios revenue to benefit as growth in the broadband base offsets the impact of the shift from the triple-play bundle to stand-alone service. Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.9% to $9.9 billion. Margins were 41.5% in the quarter, up 160 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 45.5%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year, including an impact of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. Now, let's move to our Business segment on Slide 11. Business wireless trends remained resilient throughout the year and the fourth quarter was no different. Public sector demand remained strong on the success of our distance learning program and support for increased needs of state and local government agencies. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, while we experienced modest pressures in enterprise. Business segment fund gross adds for the quarter were down 11% from the prior year due to store closures and continued economic weakness. Segment postpaid phone churn was 0.98% in the quarter, which was down 2 basis points over the prior year. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 116,000. Let's now move to Slide 12, to review the Business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment were $8.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down slightly year-over-year. Full year operating revenues of $31 billion, represented a decline of 1.5% from the prior year. Wireless service revenue in the quarter accelerated to 7.1% year-over-year from 4.9% in the third quarter, which was more than offset by reductions in wireless equipment volumes and secular pressure on legacy wireline products. Looking at wireless service revenue, public sector had a particularly strong quarter and small and medium business growth improved for the second straight quarter, although it was still below pre-pandemic growth rates. Legacy wireline product trends appear to be normalizing after initially benefiting from the transition to a work-from-home economy. The growth in advanced communication services continues to drive opportunities for the segment. While we are pleased with the revenue performance of the Business segment and exit 2020 with momentum, there are uncertainties around how businesses will perform in 2021 given the challenges within the macro environment. The elevated demand experienced in public sector and parts of enterprise throughout 2020 could potentially create headwinds to growth in the Business segment, particularly in the back half of 2021. Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, up 390 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the strength in wireless service revenue and the benefits of our transformation initiatives, including back office digitalization and optimization. Full year margins of 25.4% were up slightly versus last year. Now let's move on to Slide 13, to discuss Verizon Media Group. We are very pleased with Verizon Media Group performance. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up approximately 11% from a year ago, the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends with demand-side platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year. Advertising strength came from political, consumer products, technology and retail, among other verticals. The fourth quarter also saw continued high consumer engagement in commerce as offline to online shopping behaviors continued through the holiday season on our owned and operated properties. In particular, mail e-commerce revenue growth was 7x that of the prior year, and we saw continued strength in finance and news as daily active users grew 52% and 11%, respectively. Let's now move on to Slide 14 for a quick look at overall wireless performance. Key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segments are illustrated on this slide. Total wireless service revenue was up 2.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 0.7% for the full year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website. Now let's focus on our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We are excited to deliver 2021 expectations that include accelerating revenue and earnings growth driven by our five growth vectors as wireless service strengthens and 5G continues to scale. This year, we are providing an outlook for service and other revenue, which includes revenues from across all of our businesses, but excludes wireless equipment revenue given its variability, especially in the current environment. For 2021, we expect service and other revenue growth of at least 2%, reflecting an acceleration of total wireless service and Fios revenue growth as well as continued momentum in Verizon Media, partially offset by ongoing legacy wireline product declines. Included in this outlook is total wireless service revenue growth of at least 3% driven by our tiered unlimited plans, new customer contributions and ongoing strength in business. For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings per share of $5 to $5.15 driven by recurring service and other revenue growth as well as ongoing cost initiatives. We assume no significant year-over-year impact from below-the-line items based on the 2021 opening balance sheet. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%. Our consolidated capital spend for full year 2021 is expected to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, consistent with the prior year and within our normal capital intensity range. Our focus for the year includes further expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in new and existing markets, densification of our network to manage future traffic demands and continued deployment of our fiber infrastructure. Our cash flows in 2021 are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by taxes and working capital. We anticipate that our cash taxes in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, given expectations for higher pre-tax income this year and a one-time $2.2 billion cash tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2020. Working capital was a tailwind in 2020 due to the lower equipment volumes, which we do not expect to repeat in 2021. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our 2021 priorities. Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say was certainly some level of pressures will continue to exist on the business throughout the year. I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic, but we're not overly optimistic either. We assumed some level of pressures that you saw from the second half of the year, our ability to still execute within that type of environment. In terms of the fourth quarter, as you say, there was actually the COVID impact was actually a $0.02 benefit. And what you saw there was a couple of one timers, but primarily it was a case of the revenue pressures we saw declining versus what we'd seen in 2Q and 3Q. You think you -- media as an example, which had been significantly hit by COVID impacts earlier in the pandemic, but certainly no impact in 4Q as we recorded that 11% revenue growth there. So those revenue -- some of the revenue headwinds moderated in the fourth quarter, the expense benefits continued. That's why you saw the $0.02 net benefit, which actually completely offsets the $0.02 headwind from 606. So, if you kind of think about in the fourth quarter, 606 and COVID have a no net impact on the results, and that $1.21 stands on its own the 7% increase on a year-over-year basis. Hey, John, so back to your couple of questions around the guide. As you think about the 3% service revenue, it's really a combination of subs and ARPA. Hans, obviously talked through all of the things that will drive the opposite side of the equation. But we certainly do expect subs growth, account growth, and net add growth is important to our business as well. We will do that in a disciplined way. We're not going to chase unprofitable growth, but you should expect to see volume growth in the business as well as ARPA growth. And then the margin improvement, cost savings where, as you mentioned, we're close to the achieving the $10 billion program well ahead of the end of 2021 timeline that we put in place. But just because we hit that doesn't mean we -- it doesn't mean we'll stop. There is significant opportunities to continue to make our business more efficient. The teams are very focused on those. And you know that the $10 billion goal won't change us -- won't slow us down at all from continuing with that. As you think about margin improvement, obviously, revenue will be a big driver of that. And then you combine that with the cost savings. The one thing I would say is, as we have an improvement in EBITDA margin dollars, if we have equipment revenue increase this year, which we would certainly be glad to see an indication of the overall economic activity picking up, you'd see an impact of that in the EBIT margin. So you could have EBIT dollars grow, but margins not grow as much just because of the impact on the numerator and denominator from the equipment revenue. But we're certainly very much focused on the dollar side of that equation, and excited with the guide we have for the year. Yes. Thanks, Hans. Craig, I think the retention side of the business is performing very, very well and we are doing that through the quality of the network, the quality of the customer experience and not having to do anything additional to drive that type of retention numbers that you see. So, it's been a very strong story there, and we would expect that to continue. Yes. So just back on the postpaid churn, Mike, for a second. Certainly, there is a pandemic contribution, but as Hans mentioned, a lot of Verizon specific pieces too. I'd also point out that the fourth quarter churn number included the impact. If you think about the Stay Connected customers, there was a delay in those customers going all the way through a collections process and so on. And so, you had a positive benefit from that in Q2 and 3Q, a little bit of a catch up in 4Q. But even with that, a very strong churn number, and it's just based off of the best network experience as you saw confirmed again by RootMetrics yesterday. When you put that together with everything else we do, customers who get on the Verizon network want to stay on the Verizon network. Thanks, Hans. So on, the cash flow question, Doug, so when you talk about the swing factors, obviously, it starts with higher earnings for the year. Above the line earnings will be obviously the largest driver in the cash flow for 2021. In terms of things that potentially go the other way from a cash flow standpoint, we would expect obviously higher earnings will lead to higher cash taxes. But in addition to that, we had the $2.2 billion one-time cash tax benefit in the second quarter last year that obviously won't repeat. So that will be a year-over-year difference in the cash flow. And then working capital, as you say, the biggest item in working capital is going to be in the receivables side, predominantly on the handsets. Obviously, as volumes go down, the amount of device payment contracts with customers we are doing goes down as well. So, even if we don't see an uptick in volumes this year, if they're just flat year-over-year, you have the removal of that tailwind from last year. So, all in all, you're going to see the increase from higher earnings with some offsets from cash taxes and hopefully on the equipment receivables side are going to be the key factors in there. Yes. So, Peter, I think that's exactly it. If the 3% plus service revenue guide is going to drive -- is driving the EPS growth, that's in the guide as well. So certainly, it's profitable growth. In terms of comparing it to historical incremental revenue, I think there is obviously different components all the time. But absolutely, everything that we're doing to step customers up from a revenue standpoint also creates incremental lifetime value with those customers. So, you should expect that to be a continuation of how we approach the marketplace that we bring customers on, and we do it in a way that creates significant economic value for us over the long-term as we provide best-in-class experiences for those customers. Nothing changes there in our mindset. Yes. So thanks, Colby. Maybe I'll go in reverse order there. We -- while we expect TracFone to close in the second half of the year, our guidance is -- it doesn't assume any significant impact on the EPS during the year. But we will update that if necessary, during the year. Corporate taxes, our assumption, as you heard in the guide, 23% to 25%, that's where we've been the last few years. Obviously, we do our outlook based off of what is on the legislative books. And so, we do it based on what's there right now. We look forward to seeing how the new administration works on a number of different issues. And if that changes the way we look at the business going forward, we will obviously talk about that at the appropriate time. But we are very confident in the business. Look, we had good dividend coverage when we had a much higher tax rate not too many years ago. So while we certainly believe that the current rate has been very helpful in job creation and in economic growth creation, we are certainly very comfortable with how our business is set up as the administration is looking at different things. And in terms of CapEx, I think what you're seeing is a very efficient capital deployment model within the Company. That's why you see a guide that's in line year-over-year as we continue to do all of the things that we've done, whether that be on LTE, the 5G build. You heard Hans talk about our goals for the Ultra Wideband build this year, continuing the fiber build out. And so, I think the team has got a very good momentum going there. As they've got more into those things, the efficiencies continue, that's why you see the guide where it is."

            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and Happy New Year to all of you. First of all, 2020 was a challenging year and I can only say that I'm super proud how Verizon responded to the changing environment during 2020. And we supported our customers, our employees and society in a way that I've never seen before. So, all in all, a great year. At the same time, we executed well on our strategy and so that we had really good financial performance as well. When it comes to our 2020 strategic priorities, let me walk through the execution of them. First of all, strengthening and grow the core business, I'm really proud to announce that we continue to have the best network in the nation. We just got for the 15th time the overall best network with RootMetrics on all seven different categories. That includes 5G, which is so important to us that we continue to have that lead. I'm also happy to announce that we won for the 26th consecutive time the J.D. Power's award. It tells a lot about our network and technology team, how they have been building a network and how we continue to lead this market. When it comes to the customer innovation, you have seen us working with our customers to give them richer offering, and also even better performance on the network. This year with Disney+, Discovery+, also adding in the iPhone 5 from Apple has, of course, supported a lot of innovation that we're doing in the Verizon Consumer Group. And we see a great migration of our customers to unlimited and to the premium unlimited. Finally, you can see also that Verizon Business Group has a year on investments to see that we are putting a foundation to be much stronger for the future had good growth in the wireless, and also in some areas like the public sector, very good performance and also adding local new customers on the enterprise side. When it comes to us leveraging the assets to drive new growth, the commitments we did in February 2020 when it comes to 5G were all met or exceeded. I'm extremely happy with that. We now have 64 Ultra Wideband cities. We are more than 10 cities on our home 5G Ultra Wideband, we have 10 Mobile Edge Compute centers public with Amazon. All in all, we deployed more than 5x more Ultra Wideband sites during 2020. And we launched the nationwide 5G that now is covering 230 million POPs in 2,700 cities. On the financial side, a strong year ended where we had more than 2% growth in the wireless service revenue. We also have growth on our EPS in the fourth quarter, over 7%. We had an operational cash flow full year of $41.8 billion, which is a growth of 17%. A very strong year that put us in a good position while going into 2021. And finally, we've a really large focus on how to include all our four stakeholders in the work we are doing. And I'm really proud of the Citizen Verizon that we launched during last year, which is a great way for us to see that the society aspect is part of our strategy, where, of course, our focus on being carbon neutral is very important; and the second green bond was launched at the second half of 2020. So, all in all, I've to say, it was a very different year, but a great execution where we hit all our strategic milestones at the same time as we pivot and supported all our stakeholders. At the November sell-side event, I presented the five vectors of growth. Those are the vectors that is based on our strategy of Network-as-a-Service. Those are also the enablers for us to get to GDP plus. We have great traction on them, and we also have done quite a lot in 2020, all the way from the 5G adoption to the customer differentiation that I talked a lot about, the new markets that we are addressing still pending the acquisition of TracFone, but we have other segments we are addressing, as well as the next-generation business-to-business application based on our unique Mobile Edge Compute offering that we have with Amazon, also now with Microsoft and many other partners. And finally, the network monetization with our MVNO partners, which are enjoying the best network that we have and we are building. All in all, this is built on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that we outlined some 3 years ago and giving us the opportunity to have great execution in the future. With that, I would like to hand over to Matt to go through the financials in a little bit more detail. Thank you, Matt. Let me review the 2021 priorities based on the four pillars of strategic priorities, starting with the core business. And as you heard Matt talking about accelerating the service revenue, I'm pleased that we are guiding for a plus 3% wireless service revenue growth in 2021. That's based on that we will continue to differentiate our value proposition for customers. We also will continue to invest in our Verizon Business Group to capture that potential we see in the Business segment with a new platform that we are developing together with our customers. When it comes to our 5G and investing in our business, we have a big year in front of us in 2021. Again, we are going to almost double the amount of 5G Ultra Wideband sites. We are going to have 14,000 new sites coming in during 2021. That will enable us to continue to increase with plus 20 cities when it comes to 5G Ultra Wideband. And we are also going to add some plus 20 5G Home cities, at the same time, focusing very much on the 5G Mobile Edge Compute with 10 more sites when it comes to the public side. And then on the private side, we will scale that network together with the demand that has come as we know already, all underpinned with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and the fiber that we are deploying. When it comes to the financial, Matt talked about that we continue to focus on to accelerating the earnings per share growth, now with guidance of $5 to $5.15 earnings per share. The year 2020 solidified our balance sheet, and we will be continued focused on the cash flow generation. And finally, when it comes to our culture and our purpose, we have very much focused on the customer-centricity and the brand strength that we have built in the market. That will continue, as well as we will have also the Citizen Verizon totally included in the overall strategy. You see that we are managing all the four stakeholders that is making the success for Verizon in the future. So very clear, a year of execution. We have progressed one more year on the Verizon 2.0. We are in a great position. I'm really excited to go into 2021. I'm pleased to announce that we will have our normal Investor Day in the early part of 2021. We will come back with the exact date in due time. And by that, I would like to hand over to Brady for Q&A. Thank you, Phil. Let me start by the subscribers then. I mean, first of all, we came into the third quarter already, I mean, we have our model with the migration of customers, giving them a better network and a better experience, and that is really how we are managing our base and we came with a good momentum in the third quarter. And so in the fourth quarter, we had service revenue growing more than 2%. That we said also in the guidance. That's so important for us because we have a model where our net addition is part of our strategy, how we move them up. And as Matt said, we have now more than 60% of our customers on unlimited, but more important, I mean, if you look in the fourth quarter, 90% of the new net adds took unlimited, and out of those 55 to premium. And the premium is of course where we are at the end of 5G we're adding in Discovery+, Disney+ the way that our -- that Ronan and his team has worked in with these migration path and we believe and as you heard in the guidance that Matt talked about, we believe that we can continue that work with the organic service -- wider service revenue growth with a model we now have, and we have proven the model over the years. And let's also remember the business side has performed very well when it comes to the wireless account. I mean, we are so strong with the public sector with large enterprises on the wireless side. So that is giving us a lot of positives going into 2021, with the guidance we've of continued service revenue growth on the wireless side. And we will constantly measure what actions we're taking, but we feel good about it. When it comes to the fiber question, yes, we continue to roll out fiber. We're probably in the year three or four right now. We -- I would say, we -- the majority or vast majority of all the 5G sites they have our own fiber. We are migrating our 4G sites where it's a good return on investment t our own fiber. And over time, we will also open up opportunities for resell to our -- to enterprise customers and wholesale. So I think that we are seeing that benefit already on the 5G build, because we are using our own fiber. To get the full impact, we also have a couple of years left in order to have it in all the areas. But we are coming far away on a fiber build and we will continue to do it where it makes sense from a return on investment. So we feel really good about that and that's part of our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. I can start with the last question, and Matt can come back to the first. So when it comes to our guidance for EPS in 2021, of course, there are uncertainties of the pandemic and so on. But some things we know, I mean the roaming charges will continue to be a headwind. We also think that as the pandemic and economic recoveries is coming back, probably latter part of '21, the public sector will not have an equally strong year as they had in 2020. We also believe the SMB will continue to be subdued and have a challenge in '21. And as we saw, during the full year, the switch pool has been lower due to the traffic in the stores et cetera. So that that's we are factored in. But on the other hand, we have line of sight to what we're doing because we're executing on a strategy when it comes to migration of our customers. What we're doing in Verizon Business Group and also Verizon Media Group, as Matt said, they were now for the first time ever have a year-on-year growth of 11%. All in all, that is giving us the confidence that we can live up to this guidance. But there are some uncertainties and there are some headwinds from COVID, but we think that with those assumptions we have we can actually do this. And this is a continued work with the EPS growth and acceleration that we've talked about for so many years right now. And we continue to show that we can do with the assets we have and how we're executing. Matt? Yes, absolutely. We are excited about the 5G in 2021. I mean, on the mobility side, we're already seeing monetization happening. I mean in the fourth quarter, with so many customers taking the premium and going for unlimited, that's sort of where we have our sweet spot with the 5G. And, of course, with the Apple iPhone right now in 5G that has now kicked off that, so that you will see through the year when it comes to our mobility case. When it comes to 5G Home, we've very solid progress in 2020, came out with this new CP, we added some 12 cities, now with 5G Home with the NR technology. And our plan is doing a 20 plus markets more in 2021. So now we're starting to get a solid foundation for the 5G Home. And as you heard in my remarks, I mean, we're doubling the amount of sites almost in 2021. So, we're now getting to a very, very solid positioning there. But I said before on the Ultra Wideband deal, we're building it mainly in the very dense urban areas and then in stadiums, et cetera in the beginning. So we covered less of houses or residential in the beginning. But as these continue right now, we're capturing more and more. So I'm really excited. We also know that the CPE is really good so and the self-install is working well. So we're looking forward to seeing that happening over the year more and more. On the 5G Mobile Edge Compute, we have a great funnel of customers on the Business side. And we are not expecting that will be in significant revenues into '21, but you're going to see a lot of customers signing up for the 5G Mobile Edge Compute both the private and the public in '20 -- in '21, in order for us to have a very solid base going in to '22. So, a lot of excitement around 5G. I think we have built it absolutely right. We have an opportunity in front of us that we have been working on for a couple of years right now. So, I'm happy with my sales team. I'm happy with the technology team, and we have a big year in front of us. Let me start, I mean, on the 3% growth, I think we have our strategy when it comes to how to grow with the migration of customers and all of that. And as always, the team is validating how to make offerings, if we should be more aggressive or not, but we always think about do long-term positive impacts for our shareholders financially. And you have seen us now working for the last 2.5 years since we launched unlimited, we are doing the right things in order to make a long-term impact positively for shareholders and for our customers. And so especially Ronan and the team, they've quite a lot in the portfolio, but we have now proven that this model is working when it comes to migration of unlimited with the best network and adding in also new value-added services, everything from Disney+, the Discovery+, Apple Music and it might be more coming up in the year as well. So, I'm confident that guys have that in the portfolio. And as you heard about the Disney+, it's -- I think it's just unheard of how we can help the direct to consumers. I mean, two thirds are signing up or more than two thirds are signing up to continue to service after 1 year. I don't -- I think that is something standing out. On the EBITDA, Matt will come back later on, but I can say that we continued with efficiency. And it's the reason why we are giving a guidance that we will grow the EPS again, and the majority or all of it is basically above the line, as Matt said. So this is operational improvements, and improvements as we are growing our top line. Again, we have proven the model, the five vectors of growth and now we're in the middle of executing. And finally, on CapEx. This is what we need to do right now. We -- the technology team has all the means to have to execute on a strategy with assets we'll have to date. The only thing I can say, as I said, I'm not sure how many times before. We will only increase CapEx if we find something that has a really good return on investment. And then we'll come back and talk about it. Right now, we have everything that we need to execute the plans that we have in front of us. Thank you. On the Verizon Media Group, I just want to remember you that we started this journey somewhere in 2018, resetting the overall strategy of Verizon Media Group. We started with that. We started to take out cost. We changed the product portfolio. We went into a very clear brand value of trust and privacy. The team has just done an outstanding job. I mean, they have bringing this from sort of going down with a decrease in growth of 15% to 20% per quarter. And now they're turning around with extremely sharp products as including also consolidating some, I'm not sure if it was 10 or 15 different ad tech platforms to one. I think it's great. We have put them in a position that we are really happy with. So, I'm looking for how these guys will execute, and we are now in the position where I wanted it to be. And then, David, on your question on the VBG volumes. So certainly, as you think about what we've seen this year, especially in the public sector part of Verizon Business Group, very, very strong year. Obviously, some of that is due to the circumstances that we've seen across the country. So I would actually be very happy if we saw some pressure on those volumes in the second half of the year. That would mean good things were happening elsewhere that would be very supportive of our Consumer business, very supportive of our SMB businesses as well. So certainly, it's part of some of the uncertainty that exists as we think about the year, but just wanted to call out the fact that if we see the improvements we expect, we may see the -- some impact there on the public sector side of our Verizon Business Group volumes. But as I say, I think that would be more than offset by other parts of the business. So, what you've seen and what we expect in '21 is a continuation of what you saw in 2020 is that as we have so many different parts of the business, irrespective of how the macro environment plays out, we can put together very strong consolidated results. Thank you. First of all, I think the competitive landscape is always there and competition is also equal. I think that we just have a little bit different strategy. I mean, first of all, quality net adds is for us very, very important. And as you can see, we are adding this very important net adds. We want quality customers that likes our network, that likes our offerings and our experience. And if you look at what we have done in the last 2.5 years with our migration story, that's exactly what we have done. And that's what you see an impact in the fourth quarter. We are growing our service revenue as well as the guidance for next year. So we are confident with the strategy we have, and that might not be the same strategy that others have, that we can grow. And that's part of the five growth vectors we have to get to GDP plus. And with the guidance that Matt gave or we gave with plus 3% on the wireless service revenue, I think we have all the confidence in the model we have and how we'll work with. But it's also true that the switcher pool during 2020 in the fourth quarter was lower due to COVID, less traffic and all of that. So -- but all in all, we are very pleased with the high-quality net additions that we are getting and that we can create growth with that and continues on. Matt? Thank you, Craig. No, first of all, you're absolutely right. On the wireless side, our D2C strategy is great. We have a platform that nobody else, when it comes to distribution, brand and network, and we can cope with this. We are not going to have 100 different type of offerings. But the discovery+, the Disney+, they are sort of super A brands that we want to work with or Apple Music. We will look for more of these to see that they're fitting into our customer base, that they like it and are willing both to upgrade and migrate. So, we will continue with that. On the Fios side, of course, we will continue with the video right now. But you've seen us also starting with Mix & Match, starting to shop up this because ultimately, I want our customers to have choices. And I want them to choose. If they want the D2C solution or if they want a linear or they want over-the-top, they should be able to choose it. And look at the numbers in the fourth quarter again. We continue to grow our Fios Internet customers and we have a decline in the video customers. That's good for us, I mean, financially. But ultimately, it is to meet our customers' needs. And I think the whole setup that we did in Verizon 2.0 is just catered for us to do things that we never thought about before. We have a Consumer division thinking about how are we now delivering to consumers and that's what you see in the numbers. That's what you see in the numbers that we have. We have the same in Verizon Business Group. They are thinking totally different we have done before. And we still have more to do with platforms and things to be even more scalable and be able to bring more to the bottom line. But I have to say, I'm pleased and I hope that you guys, what you see, are pleased as well. I mean the strategy is working. We have the five vectors of growth. We are going into 2021, we have proof points on all those five, including the video strategy you asked about. Thank you. I will start and will let Matt make some comments as well. But on the postpaid churn, I think that we are just having a great moment with our customers. They love our network and the performance we have and the additions we're doing with 5G and 5G Ultra Wideband. At the same time, our all offerings are so distinct and different than anybody else in the market, where they can go to the unlimited premium together with Discovery+ or Disney+ or Disney+ Plus, Plus. We have ESPN and Hulu included. I think nobody else has those type of things in the market. And our partners, at least if you ask them, I think you should, are very happy and pleased on how we can deal with this. We are happy with it, both from a retention but also from a bottom-line side. We were making money on this, which is the whole idea with the Network-as-a-Service that we're building on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. On the wireline side, I think the whole idea of the Verizon Business Group is really to see that we are working these year-over-year. This is nothing that you fix in a month or a quarter or two. This is things that we need to invest in a billing system, direct-to-consumer, call centers, everything being set up to deliver scalable platforms for our customer in the Business side. That will, over time, improve our margins in the Verizon Business Group. And I think that if you look at 2020, I mean, it was a good performance of them, still doing investments in order to get where we want to get over time. And then we add to that new opportunities, like 5G Mobile Edge Compute. Matt? When we talk about devices and what's happening with the upgrades and so on, I mean, remember also that the Apple 5G phone came out, I would say, late in the fourth quarter, that's when this all started, at the same time as we had the pandemic. Still, I would say we are very pleased what we've seen with our customer migrating to 5G. Remember, we have a fair share or a big share of Apple users in our base. So, I think that this is a pretty normal, maybe some little bit subdued, but it's very normal upgrade cycle that we will see. And 5G will just getting better and better. I mean, that's what's happening. I mean, we are fortifying our network, we're improving the performance constantly. I remember when I talked about Ultra Wideband reaching maybe one gigabit per second, now we're up to four, five. So there's so much more to do. And the same goes for our nationwide, improving all the time, performance better. So, I think that is coming together as the accessibility to phones are coming out much more and all the main brands have a 5G phone and all of them with Ultra Wideband. So, I think that we will see that continuing into '21 and '22. But there are longer cycles today when it comes to customers migrating to new phone. They're very attached to it. But I think this is no different than 4G cycle. I think we actually are -- this is going faster than the 4G cycle. It's just that our memories are so short, so we don't remember that. But clearly, this is equal to, too better than what we saw in the 4G cycle that happened some 10 years ago, which I refer to myself when I talk about my memory, so nobody else. Okay, Matt? I think that was outlined -- the guidance for 2021, we are looking for profitable growth. And that is how Verizon has worked as long as I recall. Now I haven't been here all my life, but we work with profitable growth. And that is in the Consumer group as well. We will see that we have the best offers for our customers and we will manage our P&L at the same time and we will be aggressive, if it's needed, to get long-term effects. But as you can see from the guidance, it's a profitable growth we're looking for. We should be able to both grow as well as making that a profitable growth and that's in the guidance."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.  As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder we have entered the quite period for spectrum auction 107. So, we will not be able to comment on our current midband spectrum holdings or strategies. Additionally, please remember to join us on November 11th for our Fall Sellside Meeting from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. We will be streaming this event live via BlueJeans for everyone that can attend virtually. You can find details on our Investor Relations website.  Now let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.05 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported results include a net pretax charge of approximately $1.1 billion related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities. Excluding the effect of this special item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.25 in the third quarter compared to a $1.25 a year ago.  Let\u2019s now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our third quarter earnings profile. Consistent with the approach we have shown for several quarters, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of Accounting Standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition in 2018. We expect 2020 to be the final year that the adoption of this standard will have a material year-over-year impact on our income statement.  We realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 during the third quarter, compared to the prior year primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.02 for the quarter and $0.07 year-to-date. For full year 2020, we continue to expect the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09.  Matt will go through the COVID impacts that we\u2019ve experienced across the business in more detail. Overall, we estimate that there was a $00.05 headwind included in the reported and adjusted EPS from COVID during the quarter. While adjusted EPS was flat in the third quarter including the impact of COVID and ASC 606, we continue to see underlying growth in our operations.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hans. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady and thanks for everyone joining this third quarter earnings release from Verizon. I would like to start reflect over the current situation we have. Of course, I have mentioned several times [indiscernible] multiple crisis, the pandemic is continuing the economical downturn and the racial injustice. We, as a corporation had continued with our three-pronged governance to see that we are managing this in the best way.  Of course, our team is very focused on the crisis of the pandemic and having a team working on that. But the majority of my executive teams are working with business as usual to see that we continue to move this company forward.  And finally, we are also working a lot with new opportunities that arise from this crisis to see that we are actually coming out as a stronger company and actually serving our customers in even better ways.  I would like to say a couple of things on where we are in all this when it comes to our responsible business practices. Starting with the COVID-19, we have all the time put our focus on our employees\u2019 safety and health. That is being so important for us.  In this third quarter, we have seen our retail stores coming back to full operations. Of course with new procedures and processes. We have also seen our engineers being back in full force in the field to make installations and you are going to see that later on as we had a really great quarter when it comes to Fios installations.  On the racial injustice, and what we are doing here, we just want to highlight one important thing. This quarter we published our 2020 Diversity Representation Report. We disclosed on different levels, and different units where we stand on one of our core values which is Diversity and Inclusion.  I want to highlight the work that our treasury department did in the third quarter, they issued the second $1 billion green bond, which was led by minority-owned underwriters, continue our work with the climate change and seeing that we do our contribution.  And finally, we also decided in the quarter to provide our employees with paid time-off for employees to vote in these times which are unprecedented.  Moving on to where we are, and I talked a lot about as we came into this quarter and this second half of 2020, that this was the year of execution and I cannot say anything else that our team has been executing just fantastically. And if we talk about our network-as-a-Service, strengthening our network, starting with the 4G network, what can we say?  I mean, the team continues to take all awards. I mean the RootMetrics we named the best overall mobile networks. And on J.D. Power, we are awarded for the 25th consecutive time the best network quality. So the team is continuing to augment and improve our 4G network.  At the same time, we entered in the CBRS auction as you know, and we gained some 34 megahertz covering 140 million of the population. And all in all, that is going to help us to augment the capacity in the network especially on 4G.  Another area which we are very proud of that the team has done in the quarter is of course, continue their relentless execution of 5G networks and we launched the 5G nationwide last week and have said through the whole year that we are going to launch the network when it commercially makes sense. And it made sense last week when the iPhone 12 was launched in the market.  So now we have a nationwide covering more than 200 million of the population of the United States, more than 1800 cities when it comes to our 5G nationwide based on the DSS Technology. We also continue our expansion on the Ultra Wideband and we took a leapfrog with 19 more cities and we are now 55 cities for mobility with 43 stadiums and seven airports.  Just continue to augment our Ultra Wideband network which is just giving a huge new experience when it comes to the capabilities, when it comes to speed, latency, and of course, throughput. We also, in this quarter, launched some home cities when it comes to 5G Home or we added. So we have now eight 5G Home cities when it comes to fixed wireless access. And finally, one of the core assets for our network services of course is our fiber and the fiber richness of our network is a core element in the Verizon\u2019s intelligent edge network. We are on plan for that in these times. It\u2019s just a great work what the team has done all the way from the 4G network to the 5G networks and one fiber they are executing tremendously on our commitment for the full year.  All that network service strategy is based on us being able to monetize on top of that network. And a couple of very important events this quarter and a little bit after is of course setting us up with that monetization. Starting with the 5G adoption and the ecosystem that we are creating. We are of course extremely pleased with the launch of the 5G iPhone, the iPhone 12 that came out in four different models all with Ultra Wideband.  That is of course setting precedence how important Ultra Wideband is for unprecedented or unparallel experience on 5G bringing out all the currencies or capabilities that were talked about before.  Also this quarter, we added now the high power CPE for a 5G Home which we have been talking on for a quite a while. So now we are on the right track for that as well continue to be able to monetize on 5G fixed wireless access which is one of the different services we believe is going to be important for 5G.  And finally, the 5G mobile edge compute, which is the third business case we have on the same infrastructure, we have now five Mobile Edge Compute centers together with Amazon. We also announced that Microsoft is now joining also on the mobile edge compute, as well with a focus on the private side of the 5G Mobile edge compute.  So we are actually gathering some of the most important partners in the ecosystem to see that we can actually monetize these investments were done in a net together service. We are also having the \u2013 in the network continued with our Mix & Match and as we earlier reported that Ronan and his team has done Mix & Match 3.0 very important in times when there are so many choices. We give our customers the choices to pick their offerings and their way of dealing and getting services from Verizon.  Finally on that area, our collaboration within the company is very strong and as you saw during the iPhone launch, we launched with NFL the Super App or the Super Stadium App which was created by our Verizon Media Group which is basically seven concurrent video streams at the same time that they can enjoy either in the stadium which you cannot be today or at home if you have a 5G Ultra Wideband. Once again, we are part of a much wider ecosystem and to delivering new services.  We strengthened the core as well with a couple of new things. First of all, we are now going into the LTE home internet. We are covering 189 markets in 48 states. This is a one way for us to continue to use our great network to offering new types of services.  In the quarter, we also announced our ambition to acquire TracFone, that is adding new opportunities for us in the value segment to support that segment of customers.  Finally, on the business-to-business applications, which is the growth on top of the 5G mobile edge compute we now have five Mobile Edge Compute centers as I said. We are committed to do ten by year end and we both have now Amazon and Microsoft as partners to build that.  Finally, we have seen great opportunities based on our investments in universal communication services where we have added our BlueJeans acquisition, especially in health and education and as you are going to hear from Matt later on, we have a great growth in our public sector very much based on that.  I am really proud of my team that they can deliver this strong financial performance in the third quarter in these unprecedented times as well as with the strong execution of our platforms and our strategy.  On the consumer side, we added some 142,000 new postpaid phone net adds and continue with a very high loyalty for our customer with a very low churn levels. As I alluded to earlier, we are also very proud of what we achieved in the Fios.  In the total Fios, we added 144,000 new internet net additions. That\u2019s a five year high, which is a great work of our Fios with the Mix & Match as well as their offering and the quality level of Fios. Of course there were some pent-up demand, but all in all it\u2019s also showed the support from our customers for our Fios offering. On the Business side, we continue to do well on the wireless side both on the wireless gross adds and net adds. We have seen in the Business side the secular decline in wireline.  We had a good profitability in the quarter even though we continue to invest and we are not done with the investment we talked about in the fourth quarter last year that is so important for us to see that we are really supporting our customers when it comes to new digitalization and new offerings. But all in all, good work by our Business group.  Finally, the Media Group had a sequential improvement. There were down 7% in growth in the quarter. They had very good improvements during the quarter when it comes to growth trajectory.  Finally, they continue to add a lot of new opportunities, especially around own and operated where we have good growth in the monthly active users if that is in news or in finance, we clearly see that our content is really aspiring and doing well with our customers in those areas.  And finally, our ad tech, especially the demand side platform is having quite a lot of new customers in these times which also shows the proof of all the transformation that we have done in the Media Group.  So, looking at the financials, we had growth in our service revenue, wireless service revenue in the third quarter with 0.3%. We are clearly have been very focused on that one and it exceeded a little bit also what we said when we concluded the second quarter. We also had an improvement and growth on our adjusted EBITDA margin with 100 basis points and that includes of course the COVID impact.  So we clearly see that even though we have a decline due to hardware, we are managing our P&L in a good way in all our units. The cash flow continues to be strong. We have continue to have cash flow in the quarter even though we have the dividend and some outlays for some acquisitions of spectrum.  Finally, we are doing a positive update on the EPS guidance that Matt will talk about later on. So we feel good about going into the fourth quarter with a very solid third quarter when it comes to financial and execution and how we are dealing with the different crisis that is happening around us here in the U.S. and in the rest of the world.  So, I will then hand it over to Matt to go into more details on the financials. \nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. As we\u2019ve now completed the second full quarter in a global pandemic, I am encouraged by the strength and resilience of the Verizon team, our business and our customers. Our employees continue to deliver on our commitment to our customers and our communities in the phase of uncertain and evolving conditions.  This quarter highlights another example of our ability to execute and drive results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 included in estimated net impact due to COVID of approximately $0.05. In the third quarter, consolidated operating revenues were $31.5 billion, down 4.1%.  Revenue declines were primarily driven by significantly lower wireless equipment revenue, which was down approximately 20% due to lower customer activity and the timing of certain device launches.  We are pleased our total wireless service revenue outperformed our expectations by returning to year-over-year growth in the third quarter driven by improvements in usage and fee revenues and step up the premium tiers of unlimited.  In addition, Verizon Media Group\u2019s revenue trajectory improved significantly during the quarter driven by advertising, which returned to year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $11.9 billion, down slightly from $12.0 billion in the prior year, driven entirely by headwinds from the deferral of commission expense.  Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 37.6% versus 36.6% in the third quarter 2019 including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the commission expense deferral. Our business excellence program continues to drive significant benefits as a key component of Verizon\u2019s resilience and agility.  We have realized $8.3 billion of cumulative cash savings to-date and remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion by the end of 2021. Even after we achieve our target, operational efficiencies will be an ongoing focus across the business to identify additional long-term transformation initiatives and deliver the related cost savings.  Let\u2019s now turn to our segment results starting with Consumer Group on Slide 9. Our Consumer team continued reopening our retail stores throughout the quarter, while maintaining vigilance for the safety of both our employees and customers. We began the third quarter with nearly two-thirds of our retail stores open, although with limited hours and gradually reopened across our entire footprint with normal operating hours by Labor Day.  Consumer foot traffic is not yet at pre-COVID levels as we have implemented social distancing practices such as Touchless Retail, appointment scheduling and curbside pickup. We remain committed to providing our customers with the experience they expect while focusing on their safety.  For the quarter, we added 17,000 postpaid customer accounts, compared to a loss of 26,000 in the prior year. We are pleased with the early traction we have seen from our new Mix & Match plans as the best-in-class value offering which now includes an expanded bundle from Disney in the top tiers of our unlimited plans.  Our enhanced unlimited line-up is driving elevated step-ups and we now have approximately 60% of our customer accounts on unlimited plans with over a quarter of those on premium tiers. Customer retention remains very high and is a function of reduced customer activity levels across the industry, as well as a testament to the Verizon network performance and ever-improving customer experience.  Postpaid phone churn of 0.63% was an improvement of 16 basis points from a year ago. We continue to see strong customer collections based on the demand for our services and the quality of our customer base.  Our Stay Connected payment plan that allows keep Americans connected customers to pay off their service balance over six months has been well received including Consumer and Business customers, we have approximately 1.2 million accounts on these payment plans with over 90% having made a payment and the majority with current balances.  Based on our early activity, we expect involuntary churn in the fourth quarter to be modestly higher than typical levels, but to remain better for the full year compared to 2019. We will continue to work with these customers to keep them connected during these tough economic times.  While postpaid phone gross adds were down approximately 22%, primarily due to lower store traffic and changes in timing of phone launches, our low churn drove postpaid phone net adds of 142,000 for the quarter, as compared to 239,000 in the prior year. The retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low at 4.2% and contributed to the decline in wireless equipment revenue.  In addition to the strength in postpaid wireless, prepaid net adds of 77,000 marks our best performance in several years. We look forward to the completion of the TracFone transaction to further enhance our position in this segment where we have been historically underrepresented.  In Consumer Fios, internet net additions of 139,000 were up significantly both sequentially and year-over-year. Total Fios internet net adds across the company were 144,000, which is our highest total since the fourth quarter of 2014. The demand concerns of customers appreciation from our new Mix & Match offerings and the quality of our product when reliable internet service is more important than ever.  Our Fios team did an excellent job working through the installation backlog from 2Q and we are nearing normal pipeline levels after limiting operations in 2Q for precautionary safety purposes. Consumer Fios video net losses of 61,000 improved slightly as live sports content has picked up, but core cutting remains the key driver of video disconnections.  Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues were down 4.3%, primarily driven by a significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to reduced customer activity. This decrease was offset partly by growth of 3.1% in other revenue, and wireless service revenue was stronger than expected.  Wireless service revenue improved sequentially and was down 0.7% year-over-year, compared to negative 2.7% in the second quarter as customer activity started to recover. The pace of step-ups to premium tiers of unlimited has increased during the quarter and drove underlying growth in service revenue through higher recurrent access charges.  Usage and fee revenue improved sequentially throughout the quarter, but international travel pass remains at low levels. Altogether, usage, fees and travel pass revenues accounted for approximately 180 basis points of year-over-year pressure in the quarter.  Consumer EBITDA margin was 47.4%, which was up approximately 210 basis points from the prior year despite approximately 60 basis points of headwinds from the deferral of commission expense.  Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 11 to review the Business group results. Our Business segment continues to be resilient as our customers appreciate the quality of our best-in-class network and product offerings. Demand in the public sector remains especially strong as our team has done an excellent job providing critical solutions to customers across state and local government agencies and to education providers. Despite ongoing wireless volume pressure in small and medium business and enterprise, postpaid churn remained in line with 2019 and we have seen a steady increase in customer activity since the second quarter.  Total Business postpaid phone gross adds were down approximately 8% from the prior year. Postpaid phone net adds of 141,000 was down 206,000 in prior year, but was almost double sequentially as our customer activity continues to return towards pre-COVID levels. Business segment postpaid phone churn was 0.96% in the quarter improved slightly from prior year driven by favorable retention trends in public sector and small and medium business.  Suspend activity continues to be favorable as the majority of our suspended accounts are shifted to active status. Our Business segment customer bases remained resilient but macroeconomic conditions will continue to play a factor in the fourth quarter and into 2021.  Let\u2019s now move to Slide 12 to review the Business financial performance. Total operating revenue to the Business segment were down 1.7% from the prior year. Wireless revenue is down slightly due to declines in equipment revenue, partially offset by service revenue growth of 4.9% as compared to 3.1% in second quarter.  This was primarily driven by public sector and small and medium business and included approximately 280 basis points of headwinds predominantly from lower roaming and usage revenues in the quarter.  Operating revenues were also impacted by ongoing legacy wireline declines. However, demand for advanced communication services continues to drive underlying opportunity for the segment. Business EBITDA margin in the quarter was flat year-over-year at 25.2%.  Now, let\u2019s move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Trends resulting from the pandemic continued to impact both search and advertising. However, we are pleased with the sequential improvement from the second quarter.  Total revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, down approximately 7%, compared to last year, better than our expected range and up 21% sequentially. Year-over-year trends continued the improvement that began late in the second quarter as September revenues were down only 2.4%, compared to 19% down in June.  We continue to drive increased customer engagement on our owned and operated properties with strength in both finance and news as monthly active users grew 22% and 13% respectively. For the quarter, we saw ongoing strength in our demand side platform adding more than a third client accounts compared to the prior year.  Verizon Media expanded our partnerships and increased our commitment to build advertising inventory in new and emerging formats and launched live events with Watch2Gether and Yahoo Sports PlayAR. All of these platforms will benefit from 5G and our robust partnership with the NFL to Anywave live events together.  Let\u2019s now move to Slide 14 for a quick look at the overall Wireless performance. Slide 14 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer business segment for the third quarter.  Total Wireless Service revenue was up 0.3% from the prior year including the headwinds mentioned in both the Consumer and Business segments, a significant improvement from the 1.7% decline in the second quarter.  Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules in our website.  Now, let\u2019s review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on Slide 15. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $32.5 billion, an increase of $5.7 billion from the prior year. The growth was driven by continued performance and strength of the business, a non-recurrent tax item in the second quarter, improvements in working capital primarily due to low volumes and payments related to the voluntary separation plan in 2019 that did not repeat this year.  As a reminder, we paid three of the four quarterly Federal tax payments in the third quarter including two payments that were deferred from the second quarter. Year-to-date capital spending was $14.2 billion, up $1.8 billion from the prior year.  Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build out of our 5G Ultra Wideband and nationwide networks, the upgrade to our intelligent Edge network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60 plus markets outside of our ILEC footprint. The net results of cash flow from operations and capital spending is year-to-date free cash flow of $18.3 billion, a $3.9 billion year-over-year increase. Additionally, we invested $1.9 billion to CBRS spectrum to further enhance our network strategy.  We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and opportunistically diversify our debt portfolio to optimize our cost of borrowing, ending the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.5 billion, down year-over-year by $1.3 billion.  Our cash position remains strong finishing the quarter with $9.0 billion. In September, we completed our second green bond issuance with proceeds of $1 billion, primarily in support to our goals to source 50% of our electricity consumption from renewable energy by 2025 and be carbon-neutral in our operations by 2035.  The issuance also supported diversity and inclusion in the underwriting syndicate, strengthening our longstanding partnership with minority owned financial firms on capital markets transactions.  Our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0 times. We\u2019ve remained focused on achieving this target over time while maintaining a strong financial position to give us flexibility to invest in the business.  Let\u2019s move on to Slide 16 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. Hans and I are very pleased with the performance of our team in the third quarter building on the momentum we\u2019ve seen over the past several quarters in the phase of an uncertain operating environment, we are seeing steady improvement across our business.  Wireless Service revenue in Consumer and Business is recovering faster than we initially anticipated, and we expect total wireless service revenue to grow by at least 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.  We previously guided to full year adjusted EPS of negative 2% to positive 2% change from 2019. Given the three quarters of resilient earnings, and the trends we see into the fourth quarter, we expect 2020 adjusted EPS to be accretive and are revising our guidance upward to 0% to 2% growth for the full year.  This includes the previously discussed accounting headwinds, the impacts from COVID, and new device launches in the fourth quarter.  We are extremely proud of the Verizon team that puts us on track to deliver earnings growth in a year with truly unprecedented challenges. There is no change to our guidance for other income statement items including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate. We expect our full year CapEx to be at the upper-end of our $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion guidance.  The supply of the network equipment is strong and we continue to deploy fiber and small cells at a tremendous pace in order to enhance our network leadership position and achieve our goals for 2020. Our performance this year through three quarters have shown the strength of a great team, a resilient business and a sound strategy.  Our focus on our core competencies and the strength of our balance sheet has given us the ability to invest in the business and support all of our stakeholders in times of uncertainty.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of the year. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. Let me just quickly summarize where we are. I think we are in a moment where we are executing against our strategy in a really good way and we are creating the opportunities for our growth that we are aspiring for.  And let me start with the 5G. There are so many things we have done in the last three months and into this quarter that is really paving the way for our best network and for our customers to enjoy this tremendous opportunity to be on 5G. When it comes to strength in our core, new partners are important for ecosystem, but we are also looking to new segments.  You heard me talking about the 5G mobile edge compute that we continue with, but also ambition to acquiring TracFone to see that our network and service is really the fundamental strategy that we can monetize on top of and see that we continue to be the leader in this market.  Finally, new revenue model, many of them were being discussed, but clearly we see new opportunities especially in the Business group with 5G mobile edge compute also based on what\u2019s happening with healthcare and education and we are taking care of some of them already, but more opportunities coming with partners that we have announced this quarter, but also important in the future.  So, all in all, a very good quarter. I think we are in a very strong position to continuing the fourth quarter and into 2021 as we are executing on our strategy.  With that, I hand it back to Brady for the Q&A.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we are ready to take the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I am sure you are not surprised, but the principal topic of conversation with investors over the past week has been the iPhone 12 promo that you rolled out and that your peers have rolled out. And if we look at the way yours is structured, it\u2019s effectively a subsidy. And so, the question we\u2019ve been getting is, what got you comfortable with the nature of that subsidy design?  What positive impact are you expecting to see on your operating performance as a result of the promo? When are we going to see it as, as investors and analysts? And is there anything about the initial acceptance of the promo that has given you a sense that it\u2019s working or that you need to adjust? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I mean, let me start by saying that we feel really good about our position and first of all with the network we have, the offering that we are doing based on the Mix & Match, but also the offering you are alluding to. And then, of course, the position we have when it comes to the iPhone 12 where we have Ultra Wideband in all of them. So, I think we are operating with positional strength.  We feel really good about our offerings. We also feel good about the response. I mean, it\u2019s very early. I cannot say so much about the pre-orders. Remember, there is only two phones that is in pre-order right now. There is coming two other iPhones, the 6th of November when it comes to preorders. But we are happy with the preorders so far.  And as you have seen from Matt talking about the guidance, we feel also good about the quarter and how we are going to handle this. And as you know, I mean, this is not the first time we are into a cycle of iPhones and our guys, they know how to deal with these and they are very financially prudent seeing that long-term and medium-term this is going to be very positive for our customers and shareholders.  So, we feel really good about it. Matt? \nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. And Brett, thanks for the question. So as I look at the promos we have around the iPhone right now, the overall construct isn\u2019t very different from what we had previously. Some of the details are obviously changed from promo to promo, but this construct is very similar to what we\u2019ve done for the past few years really since we\u2019ve been in an unlimited world.  So, we are certainly expecting to see good customer take rates. We expect that to drive step-ups as we get more customers on unlimited and expect that we are very focused on driving value accretive growth across the customer base and developing long-term relationships with our customers and the promos we put in place right now are very consistent with that methodology that we\u2019ve had for many years now. \nBrett Feldman : And just one quick follow-up question. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve made a decision on this yet or not. But for how long do you expect this payment offer to be in the market? \nHans Vestberg: We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the market develops here over the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll tell you what, I am very excited when you think about having the best network both 4G and building the best 5G network, you add it with the best device portfolio. You add that in with the best value proposition with what you\u2019ve done with, what we\u2019ve done with Mix & Match 3.0. That is an incredible combination.  And so, there is a number of levers available to us. But I\u2019ll tell you what, Brett, I am very happy sitting here today holding the card in my hand that we have and look forward to how the marketplace will develop in the fourth quarter.\nBrett Feldman : Okay. Thank you. \nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brett. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead with your question. \nPhil Cusick: Hey guys. Thanks. First a follow-up on Brett\u2019s. Can you give us some idea of what has to happen to hit the high-end or low-end of the fourth quarter earnings guide? I think a lot of people are pretty impressed with the high-end and I imagine that that would have to be a lot less competition than we are seeing in the market today. But appreciate your thoughts.  And second on customer payment trends. You are the first major service provider to report. Can you give us more details on the Keep America Connected recovery trends in Consumer and Business payments? Are those on time? And you forecast that churn should pickup in the fourth quarter. Can you help us quantify that at all? Thank you. \nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Phil. So, starting with the first question on the fourth quarter range. So, when you look at, at what are you thinking about the momentum coming out of the third quarter and the momentum that\u2019s built in the third quarter with customer volumes improving as we are with the store service revenue back to growth, step-ups driving that.  The move to 3.0, I\u2019ll tell you within the service revenue growth of 0.3%, it improved throughout the quarter. The number was better in August and July and it was better in September than it was in August. So, good momentum coming into the fourth quarter. The best Fios growth number that we had in almost six years. So a lot of positives across the company as we come into 4Q.  And then, as you come into the quarter, not just the iPhone launch, but 5G nationwide. A lot of exciting things going on.  So, when you look at the year-to-date EPS number, we are up a penny on a year-to-date basis and so we feel very confident with the momentum we have coming into the quarter that we will ultimately have accretive EPS for the year as a whole even with the impacts of COVID in there and the accounting headwinds you heard from Brady and everything else. So, it gives us a really good place to finish the year and jump off into 2021.  On the customer payment trend side, again, very, very pleased with what we\u2019ve seen from customers on the stay connected program that we\u2019ve put Keep American Connected customers into at the beginning of 3Q. But payments have been in line with what we expected. We have a very experienced collections process. We have the best quality base of customers in the industry and you see that come through in the churn results.  As we get into the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll start to see the small percentage of those customers that are still struggling with the payments get all the way through the collections process and a very modest uptick in involuntary churn. But I still expect involuntary churn to be below last year on a full year basis which speaks to the testament of the work our team does and the quality of the customers that we have. \nPhil Cusick : Thanks, Matt. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Phil. Brad, we are ready for the next question \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead. \nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can we talk a little bit about, from the millimeter wave network perspective, the kind of two aspects to the business? One being the mobile network connectivity, you talked about the pooling about five times more small cells in 2020 as you deployed in 2019.  But I think that people don\u2019t have a sense as to kind of a footprint or a number that you can put around that and thinking into 2021 is the iPhone 5G becomes the thing. Can you quantify and elaborate a little bit about what the goals are for that mobile Ultra Wideband network?  And then, second, as you kind of gotten out to eight cities with the 5G Home, can you kind of put a number around what is that addressable market look like today and what is the goal for that to look like in 2021? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you very much. Let me start, and first of all, I mean, our strategy has been consistent over years and when it comes to the Ultra Wideband and the deployment has also been very consistent. And remember, when it comes to the Ultra Wideband, it\u2019s just an unparalleled experience. I mean, you might have seen that yesterday we actually made a test that we come up to 5-Gig right now.  So, this is just giving some totally different experience and that was the whole idea when we started it; we wanted to build something enormously transformative and that\u2019s what we have and that of course is playing into the whole roll out of the iPhone 12, as well, that is all capable of Ultra Wideband.  When it comes to our roll out, I mean, last week we added 19 cities and the majority of the cities where already launched were almost double the size of the footprint. So, we are in an enormously big roll out on ultra wide band. And as we said, five times more base stations this year compared to 2019. I will give you one number.  I mean, the last two months we deployed more radio base stations than we did in entire 2019. That\u2019s the pace we are up to. So we are a footprint this is growing and even though there is no people or spectator in stadiums with the Super App with NFL, what we are doing is of course, we have 5G in the stadiums and we can project that out so you as a user you can get that experience by not being in the stadium with seven screens.  So, I see we are continuing through the transformative things and the whole ecosystem is around us. As you have seen, we are now up to five different sites with Amazon commercially, on the mobile edge compute we are building a lot of great opportunities and transformative business transformations with it. So, we are really excited about it and we can see the consumers are excited about that as well.  But we are augmenting every day and I am extremely happy with our net technology team deploying this together with the fiber we are doing at the same time. So, you will see more and more we are just augmenting the Ultra Wideband network.  And as I just need to also state that, remember, we also launched our nationwide 5G covering more than 200 million people, which is on par or better than our 4G which clearly is the best in the nation as I said, I am not sure how many times I\u2019ve won the RootMetrics, J.D. Power and now we are having that nationwide.  So, we feel really good about our situation when it comes to network and what we can give to our customers.  On the 5G Home, you are right. We are now in eight cities. We have \u2013 we are also augmenting of course those cities with Ultra Wideband and we have two more cities before year end. But I said before, I mean, there is no reason why any city that will have mobility and will not be a 5G Home city as well.  And now, with the CPE that we came out with early in the fourth quarter, we also have a very compelling offering, very transformative, with a self-install, with a CPE that is much more powerful than the previous ones, much easier to detect and all of that. So, we feel good about that. That doesn\u2019t change what we have said before when it comes to our revenue trajectory for 5G and different business cases we have.  But what it shows is that we are really in execution mode right now and bringing monetization on top of our 5G investment that we are been on to for the last three, four years or as long as I remember, because I was been in for 2.5 years, because we have all the time been on this strategy. So, I am very pleased with this third quarter.  We have more to do in the fourth quarter, but a lot of things are coming in place for us right now to really talk about our strategy. \nDavid Barden : Thanks, Hans. \nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, you may go ahead. \nJohn Hodulik : Great. Thanks guys. I think I got three quick ones. First, the strong service revenue growth guidance for the fourth quarter. What\u2019s driving, what appears to be accelerating migration to the higher tiered unlimited plans?  That\u2019s number one. Number two, given the earnings guidance, and the fact that year-to-date you have some slight earnings growth. It would appear that you are not expecting much dilution in the fourth quarter from what we are seeing on the iPhone. And I guess, given the promotion job there, does that mean that you don\u2019t expect a meaningful increase in overall volumes in the fourth quarter this year as we look versus last fourth quarter?  And then lastly, follow-up to David\u2019s question, on the millimeter wave, obviously, inclusion in the iPhone would seem to be a big positive for you guys from a competitive standpoint. Hans, is there any opportunity to go faster with that 5G deployment?  I know you are doing five times to small cells that you did last year, but it would seem to be a nice competitive sort of advantage for you guys to get that out there as soon as possible. I am just wondering from a CapEx standpoint, does it make sense to go to put the pedal to the metal. Thanks. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you. Let me start just hitting a little bit on service revenue and then millimeter wave and then I will hand it over to Matt. So, on the service revenue, I just want to reiterate the strategy. We ever have since we launched unlimited and the work that Ronan and his team are doing as well as Tami when it comes to our Mix & Match, et cetera.  This has been a journey where we are differentiating our customer experience towards any of our competitors. I mean, first of all, we can Mix & Match. Number two, we have offerings with partners that no one else have, everything from Disney Plus to App and Music. We have just put the totally different way of dealing with our customers and that you see the payout.  Remember, in the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year, we were in a fantastic trajectory on the service revenue and then we all know what happened in the pandemic. And then, now we are showing that we are back and as Matt said on the service revenue, we had better trajectory in the months of August and in July and in September.  So the guys are doing a great job. I will leave it back to Matt later on for the service revenue comment, but that's how I feel about it. How good these guys are doing this. On the millimeter wave, yes, I agree with you, we are just creating a competitive advantage with the whole millimeter wave and the Ultra Wideband and you can see that all the partners we are lining up are really excited about it. If it's Apple or if it's the Wild Rift, which is the biggest game in the world that will be exclusive with us. All of that is happening at the moment. I am pushing the team every day to go faster.  Now we have also unconstrained supply. I mean, we didn't have that last year when we were so early on this and some might not remember that the conviction on the world was that 5G will start to be deployed in 2020. We have commercial network with 55 cities went nationwide. I mean, we have pushed the envelope of technology with the ecosystem since 2015 to be where we are today.  But, don't worry I am pushing and I am going to push, as well and we are managing this within our CapEx, as well. So, the team is doing well. We are giving them all the resources they need, because we understand what the competitive advantage we are creating. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Thanks, Hans. So, John, on the service revenue growth, so, certainly the migrations to unlimited are part of it. But if you look at the improvement quarter-over-quarter and I know there is a lot of focus on the Consumer side, but I'd be remiss not to point out the improvement on the Business, side as well. Business service revenue increased from 3.1% growth in 2Q to 4.9% in 3Q largely in public sector and small medium business.  And as good as our market share is in Consumer, it's even better in the Business segment. So that continues to be a driver of service revenue. But within the Consumer side, certainly continued migrations to unlimited and as we continue to add value to the proposition, which you saw us do with Mix & Match 3.0, we continue to see more customers migrate over and not just migrating over, but more customers are migrating over to the upper tiers of unlimited, as well. We see more of our new accounts taken unlimited than we've ever seen. And we think there is continued opportunities within the base to migrate people over and step them up further. So, good trajectory on service revenue and headroom for even more to come. On the EPS guide, you are right. We feel good about where we'll be in the fourth quarter here and you see that in the guide and as you think about the iPhone promos, while certainly we think those are value creative for us. I'd also draw your attention to, especially on the Consumer side how the accounting of those promos under the 606 accounting standard.  The - a large part of those promo cost will be amortized over the next 2.5 years or so, rather than hitting the income statement upfront. So, from a 4Q standpoint, the iPhone promos are more of a working capital issue than they are an EPS issue.  But as we think about the forward view, that's hopefully baked in and feel very good about where we should be in the current quarter and the jump-off point into 2021 and even with an increase in volumes coming through year-over-year, we expect to be accretive on EPS for the full year.\nJohn Hodulik : Great. Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, John. Brad, we are ready for the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir, you may go ahead.\nSimon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Strong numbers on the Fios internet side. Perhaps you could just unpack how much of this is the delays from the installation backlog from Q2? And what sort of the underlying trend both on adds going into Q4? And also on ARPU, what sort of speed tiers are you seeing? Are people upgrading within the Fios space there? And then, maybe, Hans, you could just speak to the broader economy, there is concerns that as some of the fiscal stimulus ends, we will see more small business closures et cetera. What are you hearing from CIOs and others as you engage with them? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Hey, Simon. Thanks for the question. I'll take the Fios one, first. So, with a lot of great effort by the teams during the quarter and what you really have is a fantastic product and a fantastic team putting out there and you see the results. So 144,000 net adds on internet in the quarter was our best in almost six years. There was a little bit of impact from working through the backlog from Q2.  But I can tell you, even without that backlog impact, we'd have been significantly north of 100,000. So, it's \u2013 well, that was a factor, it wasn't the driving factor. The driving factor is the quality of the product, which customers' value now more than ever and combined with the Mix & Match product that we brought \u2013 the pricing proposition that we brought into Fios from wireless in the early part of this year.  And when you brought those things together, we are seeing great results. So strong demand has continued into October and I would expect we will see normal level of seasonality in 4Q, where we see a little bit of a drop-off in overall industry volumes and as you get toward the holiday season, but great to see us taking share again, in the Fios world.  And again it's just the combination of both the great product and you put it together with the Mix & Match construct. And it's really resonating in the marketplace. So, and then, I think we still have room to grow there with a good amount of customers still with the opportunity to step up to a gigabit speeds.\nHans Vestberg : On the broader economy, I mean, I can only say two things. I mean, first of all, I mean, the public sector customers and the large enterprise customers, in general, very high activities. There are, of course, certain large enterprises that are a little bit subdued, because they are industries that are having a very tough times like the airline industry and tourism or transport. So, - but all others, I would say, the activity level is higher than ever. Many are taking the advantage of digitalizations and actually changing the way you are working and this is playing straight into our strategy that we have been deploying for years, both with the technology, but also with the go to market we designed 2 years ago or 1.5 year ago. And finally, I think, the small and medium business, that's where we see the challenge, because we still have companies that have closed down and are waiting to see if they are going to get back. It's not getting worse.  But we still have that concerns for small and medium businesses that are hard to say. So, when I talk around with my colleagues in the industry, the CEOs, they see the same a little bit. We don't know where the small end business will go after this. It depends on how long this economical downturn will be. But we haven't seen a worsening at least lately. So, that's where we are.\nSimon Flannery : Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Sir, you may go ahead.\nCraig Moffett : Hi, thanks. I want to ask a question about gross additions, if I could. AT&T's promotion seems to be quite different than yours and T-Mobile's and that it's very much focused on retention. And, just given the gross adds are already down sharply and the cable industry is taking a good chunk of gross add growth, how do you think about gross additions going into the fourth quarter and into 2021?  Is there the potential that the market is sort of starved of growth here and that it forces a more competitive stance or a more aggressive stance from you in particular, but for the industry overall?\nMatthew Ellis : Craig, thanks for the question. I think the only thing I can say to that, I feel very good about our expectation for gross additions going into the fourth quarter. We got the right combination of the best network, the great handsets out there, the right customer propositions. I think, we'll do very well from a gross addition standpoint here in 4Q.\nCraig Moffett : And, thanks, Matt, and if I could just ask a follow-up about the cable industry, just the cable industry is now having \u2013 has its own 5G promotions. How do we think about 5G under the cable contract, the MVNO contracts that you have with the cable industry? Is it fair to assume that you reopened the contracts for special pricing just given that - at least, I think most people's understanding is that the original contract was priced on a per gig basis of some kind and that that would be hard to do in millimeter wave given the kinds of volumes that somebody could run up?\nHans Vestberg : Hey, Craig. First of all, as we all know, the large MVNOs in these countries, together with us and we are very happy with that. They are very good customers to us. We have a good relationship with them and they have been taking some share.  And again, it's playing straight into the strategy we designed for two years ago, the Network-as-a-Service to actually monetize the network and the capital spend better than anybody else in this market. I am just happy to see that what's happening. I cannot go into any contractual things we are doing. But, again, we are happy. I guess they are happy, as well. So, that's how it works.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Craig.\nCraig Moffett : Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. A few if I could. First, could you just break out the $0.05 of COVID dilution? Where that would appear in the income statement during the quarter? Secondly, as you described the cost-cutting program is starting to get to the homestretch towards that $10 billion target by the end of 2021, where do the remaining savings come from in terms of the business activities? And is it an expense opportunity for savings or CapEx savings opportunity? And then, just finally on a more-broad basis, I was just wondering if you can give us an update on how you see the importance of content bundles in your wireless rate plans. And is there is any further developments on the aspirations the management team has described to leverage the consumer base for more bundling opportunities in the future? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Hey, Mike. So, as you think about the $0.05 COVID impact in the quarter, down significantly from second quarter, obviously $0.14 down to $0.05 and we saw an improvement both on the wireless fees, especially on the usage side and also the media revenues. But within the $0.05, the biggest item right now that's contributing to that is travel, travel pass and roaming revenues.  So, most of the $0.05 impact is in the service revenue line in the income statement. We think the number will be a little less than that in the 4Q and continue to decline as we go forward. But obviously, travel pass will be a \u2013 will be an ongoing headwind for some time here. As you think about the cost-cutting, you said we are in the homestretch. I am not sure I agree with that statement. We are certainly close to the $10 billion target. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we are not stopping there and I see tremendous opportunities for us across the business continue to improve the efficiency of our processes and operations and some of the changes that we've made during the course of the pandemic have only shown us additional opportunities that are ahead of us. So, we'll get to the $10 billion and then we'll just keep on going. And then, finally, the importance of the content bundle as you mentioned, the teams are always looking at the right way to bring the best value proposition to our customers and we are in a unique position given the size of our customer base and the quality of our customer base. We are very much the partner of choice for a lot of content providers.  We are very happy to have bring the Disney bundle into the 3.0 construct and if we see other ways to bring value to our customers in a way that also brings value to us, we'll certainly continue to look for those. But we are very happy with the pricing constructs and the overall value proposition we have in the marketplace today.\nBrady Connor : Great. Thanks, Mike.\nMichael Rollins : Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson : Thanks, so much. I think the iPhone questions are taken. So, Hans, my question is, just kind of a funny one. How patient are you? You've had a singular focus on wireless and 5G since you've taken over. It's a low interest rate environment, unprecedented bond market, capital is cheap, you are intensely focused on wireless leadership.  So how long is your investment horizon? If you see a great investment opportunity, maybe a large and one-time opportunity, does it have to cover what is now a bit lower cost of capital in three years, seven years, ten years? How do you think about investing in terms of timeframe, Hans? And Matt, sort of paired with that same question on the balance sheet, you mentioned the idea of getting to your target leverage over time and again, the debt markets are so attractive right now. I would think that would give you more balance sheet flexibility and elongate the timeframe by which you might need to hit that target range.  How do you want investors to think about what over time means? Is that a year or three years? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : On the first question, first of all I am happy that we have answered all the iPhone questions, because that's an important piece for us, because it was such an important event for us last week. So, thank you for that. On the horizon on investment, they are of course different depending what we are investing. So it's hard to just make an answer.  But clearly, we are trying to monetize as quickly as we can on all the investments we are doing and that's why we are talking so much about monetization right now as we have done quite a lot in the network, all the way from the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and with all the 5G. And all the 5G use cases that we outlined, the three business cases are now up running commercially. So now it's up to our sales team to sell.  I mean it's Ronan, it's Tami, it's Guru, the three CEOs that now needs to get out with a sales force to sell on it, because Kyle, which is running the technology, has bumped this network up to something that we have never seen before. So, that's how I see it. So, it's really execute right now.\nMatthew Ellis : Hi, Doug, on the balance sheet flexibility, I mean, we \u2013 our capital allocation model continues to be what we are aiming toward and we are very happy with the progress we've made on the balance sheet. It gives us the flexibility and the agility to pursue opportunities as they come up. As you've seen that even in the course of this year, we've done with BlueJeans, with TracFone, and certainly with the spectrum transactions that have taken place already this year.  So that will continue to be our focus to have that target and we'll get there as quick as we can. But no change to how we are thinking about capital allocation.\nDoug Mitchelson : Right. If you wouldn't mind me sort of adding a follow-up to that, Hans, when should investors expect to see a material level of 5G revenue given all your efforts on that front? Is there a sort of a timeframe or a year we should think about where we are going to go, Aha, there it is?\nHans Vestberg : As we outlined, I think already 2018 when it comes to 5G Home and mobility, we would start seeing something in 2021 and then, the 5G Mobile Edge Compute is for 2022. That's what we said already, I think at the Investor Day at 2018 or 2017. So, we stick to that and we'll execute on it and this team they are phenomenal group of executives I have here in Verizon.\nDoug Mitchelson : Thanks so much.\nBrady Connor : Yes, thanks, Doug. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. So, couple if I could. I mean, first is, Hans, I mean, on TracFone, could you just contextualize the objective why the change I\u2019ve heard in prepaid \u2013 with respect to prepaid, is it more a commentary on the macro environment and the saturation levels in the industry? Or is it more from the perspective of an origination pipeline?  Obviously, the deal is accretive financially, but strategically, what's the broader goals that you are hoping to solve with that? And secondly, I guess, there has been a lot of headline last couple of days around the Google payment to carriers and the amount seems meaningful enough and it's pure margins for the most part. So, if you could just help us understand how big revenue streams from application providers are and where that shows up in your P&L that might be helpful? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Okay. On the TracFone, our strategic intent is, of course, going back to the Network-as-a-Service and seeing that we monetize the network in a best way. And of course the value segment is a growing segment that is also giving us growth. So, we are hitting on two of the main objectives here. One is of course, we will monetize our network better than anybody else in this market and the capital invested.  And secondly, be part of the growth and seeing that we are actually playing in all different segments of the market when it comes to wireless. So that's the objective and as you might know the majority of these customers on TracFone, they are already on our network. So, that we have the synergies from it. But clearly that's how we see it. But we need to close it first.  We have said that\u2019s in second half of 2021. So it's a while until we get there. So, we will definitely give you more updates on that as we go on. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Kannan, there is a certain amount of revenue that we get from application providers, but it's not a material part of the overall revenue stream.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Kannan. We can't go more than that. Brad, we're ready for the \u2013 we have one last question. We are going to go to one more and then we are done for the day.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is open.\nTimothy Horan : Thanks guys. Can you give us some color around how many fixed wireless subs you think you can have kind of longer term? And what \u2013 when do we kind of ramp up to kind of full ability to add kind of customers on a monthly basis? What do you think that runrate would look like?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. On the fixed wireless access customers, as I said, we have now two offerings in the market. We have one, which is 4G and then, of course, we have the 5G which is a big push for us. We have said we're going to address 30 million households over the five to eight years.  That's where we \u2013 what we are addressing and hopefully, not hopefully, our ambition is to take a fair market share of that one as we've done with the Fios. So, that's what we're pushing for and our team is always geared to do better than the expectations. So, of course, we are pushing them hard. And as we are releasing more and more sites and more and more homes for sale, we're going to start reporting it.\nTimothy Horan : And how important is the new equipment? How much better is it? And how easy is it to install?\nHans Vestberg : It is a step change. I will say, it's clearly a step change when it comes to both the self-install, but also how much more we can cover with that CPE, because it's bringing so much more of the signal, compared \u2013 remember, the first CPE we had was basically smartphone chipset sitting in the CPE. That's what we had. So basically, we had a smartphone being the CPE.  This is catered for being indoor or outdoor CPE and as we have reported before, we have a lot of indoor installations right now, because this is working very well. So, it is a step change and mainly because we can address so many more households from one radio base station. That's the importance of it.\nTimothy Horan : Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Tim. That's all the time we have today. Everybody be safe and have a great week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. As we've now completed the second full quarter in a global pandemic, I am encouraged by the strength and resilience of the Verizon team, our business and our customers. Our employees continue to deliver on our commitment to our customers and our communities in the phase of uncertain and evolving conditions.  This quarter highlights another example of our ability to execute and drive results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 included in estimated net impact due to COVID of approximately $0.05. In the third quarter, consolidated operating revenues were $31.5 billion, down 4.1%.  Revenue declines were primarily driven by significantly lower wireless equipment revenue, which was down approximately 20% due to lower customer activity and the timing of certain device launches.  We are pleased our total wireless service revenue outperformed our expectations by returning to year-over-year growth in the third quarter driven by improvements in usage and fee revenues and step up the premium tiers of unlimited.  In addition, Verizon Media Group's revenue trajectory improved significantly during the quarter driven by advertising, which returned to year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $11.9 billion, down slightly from $12.0 billion in the prior year, driven entirely by headwinds from the deferral of commission expense.  Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 37.6% versus 36.6% in the third quarter 2019 including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the commission expense deferral. Our business excellence program continues to drive significant benefits as a key component of Verizon's resilience and agility.  We have realized $8.3 billion of cumulative cash savings to-date and remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion by the end of 2021. Even after we achieve our target, operational efficiencies will be an ongoing focus across the business to identify additional long-term transformation initiatives and deliver the related cost savings.  Let's now turn to our segment results starting with Consumer Group on Slide 9. Our Consumer team continued reopening our retail stores throughout the quarter, while maintaining vigilance for the safety of both our employees and customers. We began the third quarter with nearly two-thirds of our retail stores open, although with limited hours and gradually reopened across our entire footprint with normal operating hours by Labor Day.  Consumer foot traffic is not yet at pre-COVID levels as we have implemented social distancing practices such as Touchless Retail, appointment scheduling and curbside pickup. We remain committed to providing our customers with the experience they expect while focusing on their safety.  For the quarter, we added 17,000 postpaid customer accounts, compared to a loss of 26,000 in the prior year. We are pleased with the early traction we have seen from our new Mix & Match plans as the best-in-class value offering which now includes an expanded bundle from Disney in the top tiers of our unlimited plans.  Our enhanced unlimited line-up is driving elevated step-ups and we now have approximately 60% of our customer accounts on unlimited plans with over a quarter of those on premium tiers. Customer retention remains very high and is a function of reduced customer activity levels across the industry, as well as a testament to the Verizon network performance and ever-improving customer experience.  Postpaid phone churn of 0.63% was an improvement of 16 basis points from a year ago. We continue to see strong customer collections based on the demand for our services and the quality of our customer base.  Our Stay Connected payment plan that allows keep Americans connected customers to pay off their service balance over six months has been well received including Consumer and Business customers, we have approximately 1.2 million accounts on these payment plans with over 90% having made a payment and the majority with current balances.  Based on our early activity, we expect involuntary churn in the fourth quarter to be modestly higher than typical levels, but to remain better for the full year compared to 2019. We will continue to work with these customers to keep them connected during these tough economic times.  While postpaid phone gross adds were down approximately 22%, primarily due to lower store traffic and changes in timing of phone launches, our low churn drove postpaid phone net adds of 142,000 for the quarter, as compared to 239,000 in the prior year. The retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low at 4.2% and contributed to the decline in wireless equipment revenue.  In addition to the strength in postpaid wireless, prepaid net adds of 77,000 marks our best performance in several years. We look forward to the completion of the TracFone transaction to further enhance our position in this segment where we have been historically underrepresented.  In Consumer Fios, internet net additions of 139,000 were up significantly both sequentially and year-over-year. Total Fios internet net adds across the company were 144,000, which is our highest total since the fourth quarter of 2014. The demand concerns of customers appreciation from our new Mix & Match offerings and the quality of our product when reliable internet service is more important than ever.  Our Fios team did an excellent job working through the installation backlog from 2Q and we are nearing normal pipeline levels after limiting operations in 2Q for precautionary safety purposes. Consumer Fios video net losses of 61,000 improved slightly as live sports content has picked up, but core cutting remains the key driver of video disconnections.  Now, let's move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues were down 4.3%, primarily driven by a significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to reduced customer activity. This decrease was offset partly by growth of 3.1% in other revenue, and wireless service revenue was stronger than expected.  Wireless service revenue improved sequentially and was down 0.7% year-over-year, compared to negative 2.7% in the second quarter as customer activity started to recover. The pace of step-ups to premium tiers of unlimited has increased during the quarter and drove underlying growth in service revenue through higher recurrent access charges.  Usage and fee revenue improved sequentially throughout the quarter, but international travel pass remains at low levels. Altogether, usage, fees and travel pass revenues accounted for approximately 180 basis points of year-over-year pressure in the quarter.  Consumer EBITDA margin was 47.4%, which was up approximately 210 basis points from the prior year despite approximately 60 basis points of headwinds from the deferral of commission expense.  Now, let's move to Slide 11 to review the Business group results. Our Business segment continues to be resilient as our customers appreciate the quality of our best-in-class network and product offerings. Demand in the public sector remains especially strong as our team has done an excellent job providing critical solutions to customers across state and local government agencies and to education providers. Despite ongoing wireless volume pressure in small and medium business and enterprise, postpaid churn remained in line with 2019 and we have seen a steady increase in customer activity since the second quarter.  Total Business postpaid phone gross adds were down approximately 8% from the prior year. Postpaid phone net adds of 141,000 was down 206,000 in prior year, but was almost double sequentially as our customer activity continues to return towards pre-COVID levels. Business segment postpaid phone churn was 0.96% in the quarter improved slightly from prior year driven by favorable retention trends in public sector and small and medium business.  Suspend activity continues to be favorable as the majority of our suspended accounts are shifted to active status. Our Business segment customer bases remained resilient but macroeconomic conditions will continue to play a factor in the fourth quarter and into 2021.  Let's now move to Slide 12 to review the Business financial performance. Total operating revenue to the Business segment were down 1.7% from the prior year. Wireless revenue is down slightly due to declines in equipment revenue, partially offset by service revenue growth of 4.9% as compared to 3.1% in second quarter.  This was primarily driven by public sector and small and medium business and included approximately 280 basis points of headwinds predominantly from lower roaming and usage revenues in the quarter.  Operating revenues were also impacted by ongoing legacy wireline declines. However, demand for advanced communication services continues to drive underlying opportunity for the segment. Business EBITDA margin in the quarter was flat year-over-year at 25.2%.  Now, let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Trends resulting from the pandemic continued to impact both search and advertising. However, we are pleased with the sequential improvement from the second quarter.  Total revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, down approximately 7%, compared to last year, better than our expected range and up 21% sequentially. Year-over-year trends continued the improvement that began late in the second quarter as September revenues were down only 2.4%, compared to 19% down in June.  We continue to drive increased customer engagement on our owned and operated properties with strength in both finance and news as monthly active users grew 22% and 13% respectively. For the quarter, we saw ongoing strength in our demand side platform adding more than a third client accounts compared to the prior year.  Verizon Media expanded our partnerships and increased our commitment to build advertising inventory in new and emerging formats and launched live events with Watch2Gether and Yahoo Sports PlayAR. All of these platforms will benefit from 5G and our robust partnership with the NFL to Anywave live events together.  Let's now move to Slide 14 for a quick look at the overall Wireless performance. Slide 14 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer business segment for the third quarter.  Total Wireless Service revenue was up 0.3% from the prior year including the headwinds mentioned in both the Consumer and Business segments, a significant improvement from the 1.7% decline in the second quarter.  Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules in our website.  Now, let's review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on Slide 15. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $32.5 billion, an increase of $5.7 billion from the prior year. The growth was driven by continued performance and strength of the business, a non-recurrent tax item in the second quarter, improvements in working capital primarily due to low volumes and payments related to the voluntary separation plan in 2019 that did not repeat this year.  As a reminder, we paid three of the four quarterly Federal tax payments in the third quarter including two payments that were deferred from the second quarter. Year-to-date capital spending was $14.2 billion, up $1.8 billion from the prior year.  Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build out of our 5G Ultra Wideband and nationwide networks, the upgrade to our intelligent Edge network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60 plus markets outside of our ILEC footprint. The net results of cash flow from operations and capital spending is year-to-date free cash flow of $18.3 billion, a $3.9 billion year-over-year increase. Additionally, we invested $1.9 billion to CBRS spectrum to further enhance our network strategy.  We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and opportunistically diversify our debt portfolio to optimize our cost of borrowing, ending the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.5 billion, down year-over-year by $1.3 billion.  Our cash position remains strong finishing the quarter with $9.0 billion. In September, we completed our second green bond issuance with proceeds of $1 billion, primarily in support to our goals to source 50% of our electricity consumption from renewable energy by 2025 and be carbon-neutral in our operations by 2035.  The issuance also supported diversity and inclusion in the underwriting syndicate, strengthening our longstanding partnership with minority owned financial firms on capital markets transactions.  Our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0 times. We've remained focused on achieving this target over time while maintaining a strong financial position to give us flexibility to invest in the business.  Let's move on to Slide 16 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. Hans and I are very pleased with the performance of our team in the third quarter building on the momentum we've seen over the past several quarters in the phase of an uncertain operating environment, we are seeing steady improvement across our business.  Wireless Service revenue in Consumer and Business is recovering faster than we initially anticipated, and we expect total wireless service revenue to grow by at least 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.  We previously guided to full year adjusted EPS of negative 2% to positive 2% change from 2019. Given the three quarters of resilient earnings, and the trends we see into the fourth quarter, we expect 2020 adjusted EPS to be accretive and are revising our guidance upward to 0% to 2% growth for the full year.  This includes the previously discussed accounting headwinds, the impacts from COVID, and new device launches in the fourth quarter.  We are extremely proud of the Verizon team that puts us on track to deliver earnings growth in a year with truly unprecedented challenges. There is no change to our guidance for other income statement items including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate. We expect our full year CapEx to be at the upper-end of our $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion guidance.  The supply of the network equipment is strong and we continue to deploy fiber and small cells at a tremendous pace in order to enhance our network leadership position and achieve our goals for 2020. Our performance this year through three quarters have shown the strength of a great team, a resilient business and a sound strategy.  Our focus on our core competencies and the strength of our balance sheet has given us the ability to invest in the business and support all of our stakeholders in times of uncertainty.  With that, I'll turn it over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of the year. Yes. Thanks, Hans. And Brett, thanks for the question. So as I look at the promos we have around the iPhone right now, the overall construct isn't very different from what we had previously. Some of the details are obviously changed from promo to promo, but this construct is very similar to what we've done for the past few years really since we've been in an unlimited world.  So, we are certainly expecting to see good customer take rates. We expect that to drive step-ups as we get more customers on unlimited and expect that we are very focused on driving value accretive growth across the customer base and developing long-term relationships with our customers and the promos we put in place right now are very consistent with that methodology that we've had for many years now. Yes. Thanks, Phil. So, starting with the first question on the fourth quarter range. So, when you look at, at what are you thinking about the momentum coming out of the third quarter and the momentum that's built in the third quarter with customer volumes improving as we are with the store service revenue back to growth, step-ups driving that.  The move to 3.0, I'll tell you within the service revenue growth of 0.3%, it improved throughout the quarter. The number was better in August and July and it was better in September than it was in August. So, good momentum coming into the fourth quarter. The best Fios growth number that we had in almost six years. So a lot of positives across the company as we come into 4Q.  And then, as you come into the quarter, not just the iPhone launch, but 5G nationwide. A lot of exciting things going on.  So, when you look at the year-to-date EPS number, we are up a penny on a year-to-date basis and so we feel very confident with the momentum we have coming into the quarter that we will ultimately have accretive EPS for the year as a whole even with the impacts of COVID in there and the accounting headwinds you heard from Brady and everything else. So, it gives us a really good place to finish the year and jump off into 2021.  On the customer payment trend side, again, very, very pleased with what we've seen from customers on the stay connected program that we've put Keep American Connected customers into at the beginning of 3Q. But payments have been in line with what we expected. We have a very experienced collections process. We have the best quality base of customers in the industry and you see that come through in the churn results.  As we get into the fourth quarter, you'll start to see the small percentage of those customers that are still struggling with the payments get all the way through the collections process and a very modest uptick in involuntary churn. But I still expect involuntary churn to be below last year on a full year basis which speaks to the testament of the work our team does and the quality of the customers that we have. Yes. Thanks, Hans. So, John, on the service revenue growth, so, certainly the migrations to unlimited are part of it. But if you look at the improvement quarter-over-quarter and I know there is a lot of focus on the Consumer side, but I'd be remiss not to point out the improvement on the Business, side as well. Business service revenue increased from 3.1% growth in 2Q to 4.9% in 3Q largely in public sector and small medium business.  And as good as our market share is in Consumer, it's even better in the Business segment. So that continues to be a driver of service revenue. But within the Consumer side, certainly continued migrations to unlimited and as we continue to add value to the proposition, which you saw us do with Mix & Match 3.0, we continue to see more customers migrate over and not just migrating over, but more customers are migrating over to the upper tiers of unlimited, as well. We see more of our new accounts taken unlimited than we've ever seen. And we think there is continued opportunities within the base to migrate people over and step them up further. So, good trajectory on service revenue and headroom for even more to come. On the EPS guide, you are right. We feel good about where we'll be in the fourth quarter here and you see that in the guide and as you think about the iPhone promos, while certainly we think those are value creative for us. I'd also draw your attention to, especially on the Consumer side how the accounting of those promos under the 606 accounting standard.  The - a large part of those promo cost will be amortized over the next 2.5 years or so, rather than hitting the income statement upfront. So, from a 4Q standpoint, the iPhone promos are more of a working capital issue than they are an EPS issue.  But as we think about the forward view, that's hopefully baked in and feel very good about where we should be in the current quarter and the jump-off point into 2021 and even with an increase in volumes coming through year-over-year, we expect to be accretive on EPS for the full year. Yes. Hey, Simon. Thanks for the question. I'll take the Fios one, first. So, with a lot of great effort by the teams during the quarter and what you really have is a fantastic product and a fantastic team putting out there and you see the results. So 144,000 net adds on internet in the quarter was our best in almost six years. There was a little bit of impact from working through the backlog from Q2.  But I can tell you, even without that backlog impact, we'd have been significantly north of 100,000. So, it's \u2013 well, that was a factor, it wasn't the driving factor. The driving factor is the quality of the product, which customers' value now more than ever and combined with the Mix & Match product that we brought \u2013 the pricing proposition that we brought into Fios from wireless in the early part of this year.  And when you brought those things together, we are seeing great results. So strong demand has continued into October and I would expect we will see normal level of seasonality in 4Q, where we see a little bit of a drop-off in overall industry volumes and as you get toward the holiday season, but great to see us taking share again, in the Fios world.  And again it's just the combination of both the great product and you put it together with the Mix & Match construct. And it's really resonating in the marketplace. So, and then, I think we still have room to grow there with a good amount of customers still with the opportunity to step up to a gigabit speeds. Craig, thanks for the question. I think the only thing I can say to that, I feel very good about our expectation for gross additions going into the fourth quarter. We got the right combination of the best network, the great handsets out there, the right customer propositions. I think, we'll do very well from a gross addition standpoint here in 4Q. Yes. Hey, Mike. So, as you think about the $0.05 COVID impact in the quarter, down significantly from second quarter, obviously $0.14 down to $0.05 and we saw an improvement both on the wireless fees, especially on the usage side and also the media revenues. But within the $0.05, the biggest item right now that's contributing to that is travel, travel pass and roaming revenues.  So, most of the $0.05 impact is in the service revenue line in the income statement. We think the number will be a little less than that in the 4Q and continue to decline as we go forward. But obviously, travel pass will be a \u2013 will be an ongoing headwind for some time here. As you think about the cost-cutting, you said we are in the homestretch. I am not sure I agree with that statement. We are certainly close to the $10 billion target. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we are not stopping there and I see tremendous opportunities for us across the business continue to improve the efficiency of our processes and operations and some of the changes that we've made during the course of the pandemic have only shown us additional opportunities that are ahead of us. So, we'll get to the $10 billion and then we'll just keep on going. And then, finally, the importance of the content bundle as you mentioned, the teams are always looking at the right way to bring the best value proposition to our customers and we are in a unique position given the size of our customer base and the quality of our customer base. We are very much the partner of choice for a lot of content providers.  We are very happy to have bring the Disney bundle into the 3.0 construct and if we see other ways to bring value to our customers in a way that also brings value to us, we'll certainly continue to look for those. But we are very happy with the pricing constructs and the overall value proposition we have in the marketplace today. Hi, Doug, on the balance sheet flexibility, I mean, we \u2013 our capital allocation model continues to be what we are aiming toward and we are very happy with the progress we've made on the balance sheet. It gives us the flexibility and the agility to pursue opportunities as they come up. As you've seen that even in the course of this year, we've done with BlueJeans, with TracFone, and certainly with the spectrum transactions that have taken place already this year.  So that will continue to be our focus to have that target and we'll get there as quick as we can. But no change to how we are thinking about capital allocation. Yes. Kannan, there is a certain amount of revenue that we get from application providers, but it's not a material part of the overall revenue stream."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady and thanks for everyone joining this third quarter earnings release from Verizon. I would like to start reflect over the current situation we have. Of course, I have mentioned several times [indiscernible] multiple crisis, the pandemic is continuing the economical downturn and the racial injustice. We, as a corporation had continued with our three-pronged governance to see that we are managing this in the best way.  Of course, our team is very focused on the crisis of the pandemic and having a team working on that. But the majority of my executive teams are working with business as usual to see that we continue to move this company forward.  And finally, we are also working a lot with new opportunities that arise from this crisis to see that we are actually coming out as a stronger company and actually serving our customers in even better ways.  I would like to say a couple of things on where we are in all this when it comes to our responsible business practices. Starting with the COVID-19, we have all the time put our focus on our employees' safety and health. That is being so important for us.  In this third quarter, we have seen our retail stores coming back to full operations. Of course with new procedures and processes. We have also seen our engineers being back in full force in the field to make installations and you are going to see that later on as we had a really great quarter when it comes to Fios installations.  On the racial injustice, and what we are doing here, we just want to highlight one important thing. This quarter we published our 2020 Diversity Representation Report. We disclosed on different levels, and different units where we stand on one of our core values which is Diversity and Inclusion.  I want to highlight the work that our treasury department did in the third quarter, they issued the second $1 billion green bond, which was led by minority-owned underwriters, continue our work with the climate change and seeing that we do our contribution.  And finally, we also decided in the quarter to provide our employees with paid time-off for employees to vote in these times which are unprecedented.  Moving on to where we are, and I talked a lot about as we came into this quarter and this second half of 2020, that this was the year of execution and I cannot say anything else that our team has been executing just fantastically. And if we talk about our network-as-a-Service, strengthening our network, starting with the 4G network, what can we say?  I mean, the team continues to take all awards. I mean the RootMetrics we named the best overall mobile networks. And on J.D. Power, we are awarded for the 25th consecutive time the best network quality. So the team is continuing to augment and improve our 4G network.  At the same time, we entered in the CBRS auction as you know, and we gained some 34 megahertz covering 140 million of the population. And all in all, that is going to help us to augment the capacity in the network especially on 4G.  Another area which we are very proud of that the team has done in the quarter is of course, continue their relentless execution of 5G networks and we launched the 5G nationwide last week and have said through the whole year that we are going to launch the network when it commercially makes sense. And it made sense last week when the iPhone 12 was launched in the market.  So now we have a nationwide covering more than 200 million of the population of the United States, more than 1800 cities when it comes to our 5G nationwide based on the DSS Technology. We also continue our expansion on the Ultra Wideband and we took a leapfrog with 19 more cities and we are now 55 cities for mobility with 43 stadiums and seven airports.  Just continue to augment our Ultra Wideband network which is just giving a huge new experience when it comes to the capabilities, when it comes to speed, latency, and of course, throughput. We also, in this quarter, launched some home cities when it comes to 5G Home or we added. So we have now eight 5G Home cities when it comes to fixed wireless access. And finally, one of the core assets for our network services of course is our fiber and the fiber richness of our network is a core element in the Verizon's intelligent edge network. We are on plan for that in these times. It's just a great work what the team has done all the way from the 4G network to the 5G networks and one fiber they are executing tremendously on our commitment for the full year.  All that network service strategy is based on us being able to monetize on top of that network. And a couple of very important events this quarter and a little bit after is of course setting us up with that monetization. Starting with the 5G adoption and the ecosystem that we are creating. We are of course extremely pleased with the launch of the 5G iPhone, the iPhone 12 that came out in four different models all with Ultra Wideband.  That is of course setting precedence how important Ultra Wideband is for unprecedented or unparallel experience on 5G bringing out all the currencies or capabilities that were talked about before.  Also this quarter, we added now the high power CPE for a 5G Home which we have been talking on for a quite a while. So now we are on the right track for that as well continue to be able to monetize on 5G fixed wireless access which is one of the different services we believe is going to be important for 5G.  And finally, the 5G mobile edge compute, which is the third business case we have on the same infrastructure, we have now five Mobile Edge Compute centers together with Amazon. We also announced that Microsoft is now joining also on the mobile edge compute, as well with a focus on the private side of the 5G Mobile edge compute.  So we are actually gathering some of the most important partners in the ecosystem to see that we can actually monetize these investments were done in a net together service. We are also having the \u2013 in the network continued with our Mix & Match and as we earlier reported that Ronan and his team has done Mix & Match 3.0 very important in times when there are so many choices. We give our customers the choices to pick their offerings and their way of dealing and getting services from Verizon.  Finally on that area, our collaboration within the company is very strong and as you saw during the iPhone launch, we launched with NFL the Super App or the Super Stadium App which was created by our Verizon Media Group which is basically seven concurrent video streams at the same time that they can enjoy either in the stadium which you cannot be today or at home if you have a 5G Ultra Wideband. Once again, we are part of a much wider ecosystem and to delivering new services.  We strengthened the core as well with a couple of new things. First of all, we are now going into the LTE home internet. We are covering 189 markets in 48 states. This is a one way for us to continue to use our great network to offering new types of services.  In the quarter, we also announced our ambition to acquire TracFone, that is adding new opportunities for us in the value segment to support that segment of customers.  Finally, on the business-to-business applications, which is the growth on top of the 5G mobile edge compute we now have five Mobile Edge Compute centers as I said. We are committed to do ten by year end and we both have now Amazon and Microsoft as partners to build that.  Finally, we have seen great opportunities based on our investments in universal communication services where we have added our BlueJeans acquisition, especially in health and education and as you are going to hear from Matt later on, we have a great growth in our public sector very much based on that.  I am really proud of my team that they can deliver this strong financial performance in the third quarter in these unprecedented times as well as with the strong execution of our platforms and our strategy.  On the consumer side, we added some 142,000 new postpaid phone net adds and continue with a very high loyalty for our customer with a very low churn levels. As I alluded to earlier, we are also very proud of what we achieved in the Fios.  In the total Fios, we added 144,000 new internet net additions. That's a five year high, which is a great work of our Fios with the Mix & Match as well as their offering and the quality level of Fios. Of course there were some pent-up demand, but all in all it's also showed the support from our customers for our Fios offering. On the Business side, we continue to do well on the wireless side both on the wireless gross adds and net adds. We have seen in the Business side the secular decline in wireline.  We had a good profitability in the quarter even though we continue to invest and we are not done with the investment we talked about in the fourth quarter last year that is so important for us to see that we are really supporting our customers when it comes to new digitalization and new offerings. But all in all, good work by our Business group.  Finally, the Media Group had a sequential improvement. There were down 7% in growth in the quarter. They had very good improvements during the quarter when it comes to growth trajectory.  Finally, they continue to add a lot of new opportunities, especially around own and operated where we have good growth in the monthly active users if that is in news or in finance, we clearly see that our content is really aspiring and doing well with our customers in those areas.  And finally, our ad tech, especially the demand side platform is having quite a lot of new customers in these times which also shows the proof of all the transformation that we have done in the Media Group.  So, looking at the financials, we had growth in our service revenue, wireless service revenue in the third quarter with 0.3%. We are clearly have been very focused on that one and it exceeded a little bit also what we said when we concluded the second quarter. We also had an improvement and growth on our adjusted EBITDA margin with 100 basis points and that includes of course the COVID impact.  So we clearly see that even though we have a decline due to hardware, we are managing our P&L in a good way in all our units. The cash flow continues to be strong. We have continue to have cash flow in the quarter even though we have the dividend and some outlays for some acquisitions of spectrum.  Finally, we are doing a positive update on the EPS guidance that Matt will talk about later on. So we feel good about going into the fourth quarter with a very solid third quarter when it comes to financial and execution and how we are dealing with the different crisis that is happening around us here in the U.S. and in the rest of the world.  So, I will then hand it over to Matt to go into more details on the financials. Thank you, Matt. Let me just quickly summarize where we are. I think we are in a moment where we are executing against our strategy in a really good way and we are creating the opportunities for our growth that we are aspiring for.  And let me start with the 5G. There are so many things we have done in the last three months and into this quarter that is really paving the way for our best network and for our customers to enjoy this tremendous opportunity to be on 5G. When it comes to strength in our core, new partners are important for ecosystem, but we are also looking to new segments.  You heard me talking about the 5G mobile edge compute that we continue with, but also ambition to acquiring TracFone to see that our network and service is really the fundamental strategy that we can monetize on top of and see that we continue to be the leader in this market.  Finally, new revenue model, many of them were being discussed, but clearly we see new opportunities especially in the Business group with 5G mobile edge compute also based on what's happening with healthcare and education and we are taking care of some of them already, but more opportunities coming with partners that we have announced this quarter, but also important in the future.  So, all in all, a very good quarter. I think we are in a very strong position to continuing the fourth quarter and into 2021 as we are executing on our strategy.  With that, I hand it back to Brady for the Q&A. Thank you. I mean, let me start by saying that we feel really good about our position and first of all with the network we have, the offering that we are doing based on the Mix & Match, but also the offering you are alluding to. And then, of course, the position we have when it comes to the iPhone 12 where we have Ultra Wideband in all of them. So, I think we are operating with positional strength.  We feel really good about our offerings. We also feel good about the response. I mean, it's very early. I cannot say so much about the pre-orders. Remember, there is only two phones that is in pre-order right now. There is coming two other iPhones, the 6th of November when it comes to preorders. But we are happy with the preorders so far.  And as you have seen from Matt talking about the guidance, we feel also good about the quarter and how we are going to handle this. And as you know, I mean, this is not the first time we are into a cycle of iPhones and our guys, they know how to deal with these and they are very financially prudent seeing that long-term and medium-term this is going to be very positive for our customers and shareholders.  So, we feel really good about it. Matt? We'll have to wait and see how the market develops here over the fourth quarter. I'll tell you what, I am very excited when you think about having the best network both 4G and building the best 5G network, you add it with the best device portfolio. You add that in with the best value proposition with what you've done with, what we've done with Mix & Match 3.0. That is an incredible combination.  And so, there is a number of levers available to us. But I'll tell you what, Brett, I am very happy sitting here today holding the card in my hand that we have and look forward to how the marketplace will develop in the fourth quarter. Thank you very much. Let me start, and first of all, I mean, our strategy has been consistent over years and when it comes to the Ultra Wideband and the deployment has also been very consistent. And remember, when it comes to the Ultra Wideband, it's just an unparalleled experience. I mean, you might have seen that yesterday we actually made a test that we come up to 5-Gig right now.  So, this is just giving some totally different experience and that was the whole idea when we started it; we wanted to build something enormously transformative and that's what we have and that of course is playing into the whole roll out of the iPhone 12, as well, that is all capable of Ultra Wideband.  When it comes to our roll out, I mean, last week we added 19 cities and the majority of the cities where already launched were almost double the size of the footprint. So, we are in an enormously big roll out on ultra wide band. And as we said, five times more base stations this year compared to 2019. I will give you one number.  I mean, the last two months we deployed more radio base stations than we did in entire 2019. That's the pace we are up to. So we are a footprint this is growing and even though there is no people or spectator in stadiums with the Super App with NFL, what we are doing is of course, we have 5G in the stadiums and we can project that out so you as a user you can get that experience by not being in the stadium with seven screens.  So, I see we are continuing through the transformative things and the whole ecosystem is around us. As you have seen, we are now up to five different sites with Amazon commercially, on the mobile edge compute we are building a lot of great opportunities and transformative business transformations with it. So, we are really excited about it and we can see the consumers are excited about that as well.  But we are augmenting every day and I am extremely happy with our net technology team deploying this together with the fiber we are doing at the same time. So, you will see more and more we are just augmenting the Ultra Wideband network.  And as I just need to also state that, remember, we also launched our nationwide 5G covering more than 200 million people, which is on par or better than our 4G which clearly is the best in the nation as I said, I am not sure how many times I've won the RootMetrics, J.D. Power and now we are having that nationwide.  So, we feel really good about our situation when it comes to network and what we can give to our customers.  On the 5G Home, you are right. We are now in eight cities. We have \u2013 we are also augmenting of course those cities with Ultra Wideband and we have two more cities before year end. But I said before, I mean, there is no reason why any city that will have mobility and will not be a 5G Home city as well.  And now, with the CPE that we came out with early in the fourth quarter, we also have a very compelling offering, very transformative, with a self-install, with a CPE that is much more powerful than the previous ones, much easier to detect and all of that. So, we feel good about that. That doesn't change what we have said before when it comes to our revenue trajectory for 5G and different business cases we have.  But what it shows is that we are really in execution mode right now and bringing monetization on top of our 5G investment that we are been on to for the last three, four years or as long as I remember, because I was been in for 2.5 years, because we have all the time been on this strategy. So, I am very pleased with this third quarter.  We have more to do in the fourth quarter, but a lot of things are coming in place for us right now to really talk about our strategy. Yes. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question. Thank you. Let me start just hitting a little bit on service revenue and then millimeter wave and then I will hand it over to Matt. So, on the service revenue, I just want to reiterate the strategy. We ever have since we launched unlimited and the work that Ronan and his team are doing as well as Tami when it comes to our Mix & Match, et cetera.  This has been a journey where we are differentiating our customer experience towards any of our competitors. I mean, first of all, we can Mix & Match. Number two, we have offerings with partners that no one else have, everything from Disney Plus to App and Music. We have just put the totally different way of dealing with our customers and that you see the payout.  Remember, in the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year, we were in a fantastic trajectory on the service revenue and then we all know what happened in the pandemic. And then, now we are showing that we are back and as Matt said on the service revenue, we had better trajectory in the months of August and in July and in September.  So the guys are doing a great job. I will leave it back to Matt later on for the service revenue comment, but that's how I feel about it. How good these guys are doing this. On the millimeter wave, yes, I agree with you, we are just creating a competitive advantage with the whole millimeter wave and the Ultra Wideband and you can see that all the partners we are lining up are really excited about it. If it's Apple or if it's the Wild Rift, which is the biggest game in the world that will be exclusive with us. All of that is happening at the moment. I am pushing the team every day to go faster.  Now we have also unconstrained supply. I mean, we didn't have that last year when we were so early on this and some might not remember that the conviction on the world was that 5G will start to be deployed in 2020. We have commercial network with 55 cities went nationwide. I mean, we have pushed the envelope of technology with the ecosystem since 2015 to be where we are today.  But, don't worry I am pushing and I am going to push, as well and we are managing this within our CapEx, as well. So, the team is doing well. We are giving them all the resources they need, because we understand what the competitive advantage we are creating. Matt? On the broader economy, I mean, I can only say two things. I mean, first of all, I mean, the public sector customers and the large enterprise customers, in general, very high activities. There are, of course, certain large enterprises that are a little bit subdued, because they are industries that are having a very tough times like the airline industry and tourism or transport. So, - but all others, I would say, the activity level is higher than ever. Many are taking the advantage of digitalizations and actually changing the way you are working and this is playing straight into our strategy that we have been deploying for years, both with the technology, but also with the go to market we designed 2 years ago or 1.5 year ago. And finally, I think, the small and medium business, that's where we see the challenge, because we still have companies that have closed down and are waiting to see if they are going to get back. It's not getting worse.  But we still have that concerns for small and medium businesses that are hard to say. So, when I talk around with my colleagues in the industry, the CEOs, they see the same a little bit. We don't know where the small end business will go after this. It depends on how long this economical downturn will be. But we haven't seen a worsening at least lately. So, that's where we are. Hey, Craig. First of all, as we all know, the large MVNOs in these countries, together with us and we are very happy with that. They are very good customers to us. We have a good relationship with them and they have been taking some share.  And again, it's playing straight into the strategy we designed for two years ago, the Network-as-a-Service to actually monetize the network and the capital spend better than anybody else in this market. I am just happy to see that what's happening. I cannot go into any contractual things we are doing. But, again, we are happy. I guess they are happy, as well. So, that's how it works. On the first question, first of all I am happy that we have answered all the iPhone questions, because that's an important piece for us, because it was such an important event for us last week. So, thank you for that. On the horizon on investment, they are of course different depending what we are investing. So it's hard to just make an answer.  But clearly, we are trying to monetize as quickly as we can on all the investments we are doing and that's why we are talking so much about monetization right now as we have done quite a lot in the network, all the way from the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and with all the 5G. And all the 5G use cases that we outlined, the three business cases are now up running commercially. So now it's up to our sales team to sell.  I mean it's Ronan, it's Tami, it's Guru, the three CEOs that now needs to get out with a sales force to sell on it, because Kyle, which is running the technology, has bumped this network up to something that we have never seen before. So, that's how I see it. So, it's really execute right now. As we outlined, I think already 2018 when it comes to 5G Home and mobility, we would start seeing something in 2021 and then, the 5G Mobile Edge Compute is for 2022. That's what we said already, I think at the Investor Day at 2018 or 2017. So, we stick to that and we'll execute on it and this team they are phenomenal group of executives I have here in Verizon. Okay. On the TracFone, our strategic intent is, of course, going back to the Network-as-a-Service and seeing that we monetize the network in a best way. And of course the value segment is a growing segment that is also giving us growth. So, we are hitting on two of the main objectives here. One is of course, we will monetize our network better than anybody else in this market and the capital invested.  And secondly, be part of the growth and seeing that we are actually playing in all different segments of the market when it comes to wireless. So that's the objective and as you might know the majority of these customers on TracFone, they are already on our network. So, that we have the synergies from it. But clearly that's how we see it. But we need to close it first.  We have said that's in second half of 2021. So it's a while until we get there. So, we will definitely give you more updates on that as we go on. Matt? Thank you. On the fixed wireless access customers, as I said, we have now two offerings in the market. We have one, which is 4G and then, of course, we have the 5G which is a big push for us. We have said we're going to address 30 million households over the five to eight years.  That's where we \u2013 what we are addressing and hopefully, not hopefully, our ambition is to take a fair market share of that one as we've done with the Fios. So, that's what we're pushing for and our team is always geared to do better than the expectations. So, of course, we are pushing them hard. And as we are releasing more and more sites and more and more homes for sale, we're going to start reporting it. It is a step change. I will say, it's clearly a step change when it comes to both the self-install, but also how much more we can cover with that CPE, because it's bringing so much more of the signal, compared \u2013 remember, the first CPE we had was basically smartphone chipset sitting in the CPE. That's what we had. So basically, we had a smartphone being the CPE.  This is catered for being indoor or outdoor CPE and as we have reported before, we have a lot of indoor installations right now, because this is working very well. So, it is a step change and mainly because we can address so many more households from one radio base station. That's the importance of it."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn over the call to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations Web site. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our Web site. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Web site. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our Web site. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.13 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported results included a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $255 million, including a net pre-tax loss of $102 million related to early debt redemption costs and a net charge of $153 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.18 in the second quarter compared to $1.23 a year ago. Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our second quarter earnings profile. Consistent with the approach we have shown for several quarters, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition in 2018. As a reminder, we expect 2020 to be the final year that the adoption of this standard will have a material year-over-year impact on our income statement. As we illustrated in previous quarters, we realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 during the second quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.02 for the quarter and $0.05 year-to-date. For full year 2020, we continue to expect the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09. Matt will go through the COVID impacts that we experienced throughout the quarter in detail in his section. Overall, we estimate that there was a $0.14 headwind included in the reported and adjusted EPS from COVID during the quarter. In addition, we recognized an aggregate tax benefit of $156 million in connection with a series of legal entity restructurings related to an internal reorganization, which resulted in a benefit of approximately $0.04 within our reported and adjusted EPS. So adjusted EPS was down 4.1% in the second quarter as a result of the impact of COVID and ASC 606. We continue to see underlying growth in our operations. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and thank you, everyone, for joining this earnings call. Let me reiterate what I said in the first quarter. We are in unprecedented times with multiple crises and a business that we need to run at the same time. I can only say to all of you, I\u2019m extremely proud how Verizon and our employees have responded to all of it. I think of this quarter as a quarter where the stakeholder capitalists strategy of Verizon really bear fruit. I have reported many earnings calls in my life. This quarter it comes together with a good support of our employees, a great support to our customers when it comes to our network and our flexibility, a big contribution to our society when it comes to how we acted and supported to the site in these tough times, but also a very good and solid financial result for our shareholders. That\u2019s a really good sort of ending of the second quarter or the first half of a very unprecedented year. We have continued as a leadership team to work in a three-prong governance. Part of our team is working with the daily crisis to see that we are doing the right things and with the right priorities in this pandemic, economical downturn, racial injustice that is ongoing in the country. The second part is of course working business as usual and seeing that we continue to lead and deliver results for all our stakeholders. And finally, in a third prong is to work with what are opportunities created from this pandemic, economical downturn so we come out even stronger as a company after this is coming out to a new normal. Our strategy and our underlying strategic priorities have not changed during this time. They have been reconfirmed that we are on the right path with our network-as-a-service and our go to market. Many of the things that we outlined in the Verizon 2.0 are really playing a vital role for us being able to deliver to all our stakeholders, especially to our customers in times like this. One of the transformations was of course to have a purpose-driven company where our employees are very engaged and excited of our future, but also seeing that they\u2019re doing the right thing for our society. If I look back on the first half and looking back on our response to the COVID-19, I think we have done very well. We have decided to prioritize the health and safety of our employees. Not only that, we have also started to return to office with very safe protocols to see that our employees actually can work in the offices if they want to. But if you then look at our frontline, which never closed and never worked from home, they have continued to innovate. They innovate with the curbside delivery in our stores, Fios in a box, et cetera. And as Matt will later on talk about, we have seen a great uptake on those innovations when we look into the latter part on the second quarter. If we then talk about the racial injustice that we\u2019re seeing in the country the last couple of months, I\u2019m also proud for how we have brought that together with our team to discuss this, having a conversation in the company but also with our partners and externally. No one can say we\u2019re done enough and we just need to continue to do that. At the same time, we\u2019re donating money for some of the most important foundations that can support that transformation. Finally, I\u2019m also proud that we have packaged all our activities that we are doing for our social stakeholders in what we call the Citizen Verizon. I will not dwell on that today, but is an important piece of our overall strategy. In addition to serving our employees and society, we have of course also been very focused executing on our core business and our core strategy, and continue to develop our platform for a network-as-a-service. I\u2019m extremely pleased to report that once again for the 25th time we are winning the award for the best LTE network from J.D. Power. I have to say the engineers in Verizon have continued to amaze me and they will continue to do so in the future. Remember in February, we made some bold statements about our deployment on 5G in 2020 all the way from the Mobile Edge Compute, 5G Home cities, 5x more small cells on 5G and some 60 cities on the 5G Ultra-Wideband as well as a nationwide coverage on 5G with DSS. I\u2019m happy to report we\u2019re on track on that, and in some cases even ahead of the plan. We are continuing to deploy our technology. Our test with DSS is going very well and as well, we have launched some of the 60 markets when it comes to mobility and some additional markets on 5G Home. However, you\u2019re going to see that in the second half of this year we have a lot of new things happening and building on the foundation of the strategy and the strategic priorities that Verizon has outlined the last couple of years. If we then look into the different segments and first of all starting with Verizon Consumer Group in the second quarter, continued to gain improvements when it comes to the customer loyalty, not only in national but also by creating new services. We saw them coming up with Verizon credit card in the second quarter and they continued to gain a lot of accounts based on their mix and match and the way we have developed the ladder with different unlimited offerings. I\u2019m really happy what Ronan and his team have done and you\u2019re going to see in the financials and operating numbers that even with the challenges we\u2019ve had, they had performed very well. If you look at the Verizon Business Group that are in the middle of the transformation and I have to say the way they are now dealing with customers are bearing a lot of fruit. They are progressing well with the transformation and I\u2019m also happy to report the acquisition we did in the second quarter of BlueJeans are performing well and the growth both on usage and new customers are continuing going very well. And I was also happy last week to announce a large partnership with Airtel, one of the largest carriers in the world, to use BlueJeans for their corporate customers in India. Finally, on the Verizon Business Group, 5G Mobile Edge Compute, an important piece of our growth strategy, we have said that we are going to have 10 5G Mobile Edge Compute sites this year deployed. And now we\u2019ve also started gearing up our partners. We have announced IBM and we also talked about SAP as two very important application providers that are going to take part of our deployment and that we\u2019re collaborating with right now. So we\u2019re creating a lot of excitement around the 5G Mobile Edge Compute and a lot more to come in the second half. Finally, Verizon Media Group, of course being impacted by the advertising markets coming down. We see them coming back a little bit in June, but anyhow they have done also quite a lot of work to see that we continue to create more monthly active users on our owned and operated properties, and they also made an agreement with Walmart, which is of course one of the largest companies on earth to see that they are using Yahoo! Mail as a grocery and purchasing platform. Finally, our financial team under Matt has continued to do good work on our balance sheet. We are coming out from the quarter with elevated liquidity. But not only that, we have continued to work well on our net debt. And we have reached credit metrics levels similar to pre-Vodafone level. So that\u2019s really good work by the team. If we look into the financials of the second quarter, and Matt will cover that in more length, I only want to say that we had a very good quarter. We showed resilience. Of course, there are challenges in certain customer groups like Verizon Media Group, small and medium businesses, but many others have actually been performing well. We also need to remember in the quarter we have had not all our stores open when it comes to consumers, as well as limited sort of visiting hours, et cetera. However, if you see in the momentum we have created on the consumer side, we added 26,000 consumer postpaid accounts this quarter, which is, I would say, a good work compared to a loss one year ago in the second quarter. We also are on historical lows on our churn, and all-in-all that is giving us a good EBITDA in the Verizon Consumer Group. Finally, I would just want to highlight the very strong cash flow. Of course, we have some extraordinary tax items there, but in general it was a strong cash flow quarter. And as Matt will talk about later, we have not increased our bad debt reserves in the second quarter and he will also allude to we have good metrics when it comes to what happened in June compared to the rest of the quarter. So all-in-all, I think we have executed well for all our four stakeholders in this quarter. And by that, I hand it over to Matt to go through the financials in more detail.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let me echo what Hans said. The second quarter was unlike any other we have seen and I\u2019m extremely proud of our team and our performance. The results demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the agility of our employees to not only adapt to rapidly changing conditions, but to deliver for our customers and communities while also producing strong financial results. Due to the strength of our business model, we delivered a $1.18 of adjusted earnings per share. This includes an estimated net impact due to COVID of approximately $0.14, primarily driven by impacts to wireless service revenue and lower advertising and search revenues from Verizon Media Group. While the company's performance year-to-date has been strong, there is still a high degree of uncertainty regarding when and how quickly the economy will recover. We are confident that we are implementing the right approach to meet demand as consumer and business activity increases. Let's begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results on Slide 7. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenues were $30.4 billion, down 5.1%. Results reflected significant declines in wireless equipment revenue which was down approximately 20% in the second quarter, primarily due to limited in-store engagement and the impact of COVID on customer behavior. As we highlighted in the previous earnings call, consolidated wireless service revenue was impacted by the commitments Verizon made to waive certain fees and provide additional data for our customers as well as significant changes in customer roaming activity during the quarter. In addition, we experienced low advertising and search revenues within Verizon Media Group as customers scaled back their advertising campaigns. Included in the impacts from COVID, adjusted EBITDA was $11.5 billion as compared to $12.1 billion in the prior year. This is primarily the result of the wireless service revenue impacts from lower advertising and search revenues. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.9% as compared to 37.7% in the prior year, and includes headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense that Brady discussed earlier. Through our business excellence program, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $7.2 billion and remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by the end of 2021. We will continue our focus on operational efficiencies even after the current target is achieved. The current environment provides us with the opportunity to explore additional longer-term business transformation initiatives and related cost savings. Let's now turn to our segment results, starting with Consumer Group on Slide 8. Our consumer team quickly pivoted to adapt to the new environment. In mid-March, we temporarily closed the majority of company-operated retail stores and transitioned most of our employees to work from home, including telesales and customer service roles. We optimized our sales channel to drive more activity through online and through telesales, while introducing touchless retail and curbside pickup to streamline the customer experience as we reopened our retail stores. People are depending on connectivity now more than ever and they need reliability and quality of service. And because of that, we are seeing them increasing choose Verizon. For the quarter, we increased postpaid customer accounts by 26,000 as compared to a loss of 34,000 in the prior year, highlighting the momentum in the business and value of the Verizon customer experience. We have seen activity levels increase during the quarter with an expansion of overall volumes in May and June. Customer retention is at an all-time high and is both a function of customer activity as well as a testament to the Verizon network performance and customer experience. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 97,000 for the quarter as compared to 73,000 in the prior year. While phone gross adds were down approximately 26%, we experienced phone churn of 0.51%, an improvement of 21 basis points from a year ago. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low at 3.9% during the quarter, contributing to the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Fios Internet net additions of 10,000 were down sequentially and year-over-year as Fios installations were limited during the quarter due to temporary restrictions put in place on work inside customers homes. Our team responded with innovative solutions and developed self-install capabilities. And beginning in June, we resumed technician in-home visits across our footprint. Fios video net losses were consistent with previous quarters as cord cutting trends continued. Now, let's move to Slide 9 to discuss the consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues were down 4%, primarily driven by significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to low activation levels. This decrease was offset partly by growth of 15% in other revenue, primarily driven by recurring services such as device protection. Wireless service revenue was down 2.7%, primarily driven by declines in roaming, usage and waived fees that accounted for approximately 320 basis points of pressure in the quarter. Consumer EBITDA margin was 47.0%, which was up 50 basis points from the prior year and includes approximately 40 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Margins benefited from lower equipment volumes in the quarter, but as a reminder lower equipment revenue has a limited impact on consumer EBITDA dollars as the segment primarily operates on a device payment model. Now, let's move to Slide 10 to review the Business Group results. Reliable and secure conductivity have never been more critical, as companies continue to adapt to new ways of supporting their employees while simultaneously driving their businesses forward. During the quarter, our business team responded to the challenges of COVID, handling increased traffic needs while also meeting a surge in demand for connectivity and devices, particularly from public sector and enterprise clients. While wireless demand remained high throughout the quarter in public sector, we experienced offsetting pressures in both small and medium business as well as global enterprise. As a result, segment phone gross adds were down approximately 17% from the prior year contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 76,000, down from 171,000 in the year ago period. Business segment phone churn of 0.90% in the quarter was down 7 basis points year-over-year, driven by strength in public sector. Let's now move to Slide 11 to review the business financial performance. Total operating revenues for the business segment were down 3.7% from the prior year. Wireless revenue was down year-over-year due to declines in wireless equipment revenue, offset by 3.1% growth in wireless service revenue primarily driven by small and medium businesses as well as public sector customers. Wireless service revenue growth included approximately 400 basis points of headwinds from lower roaming and usage revenues in the quarter, which are likely to continue in the third quarter. Suspended lines as a percentage of the base have come off the highs we saw earlier in the quarter, but remain above pre-COVID levels. The likelihood of these lines returning to active status is primarily a function of macroeconomic conditions and will be a significant factor in upcoming wireless service revenue growth rates. Operating revenues were also impacted by legacy wireline declines. However, global enterprise wireline revenue was nearly flat in the quarter, a significant improvement primarily resulting from strong demand for advanced communication services during the pandemic. Business EBITDA margin in the quarter was 26.2% as compared to 27.3%, which included approximately 20 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Now let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss Verizon Media Group. As expected, the economic environment around COVID had a meaningful impact on both search and advertisement performance in the quarter. Total revenue was $1.4 billion, down 24.5% compared to last year, primarily as a result of COVID-related impacts. We continue to drive increased customer engagement on our owned and operated properties and saw monthly active users up approximately 4% with strength in both Yahoo! Finance and News, which were up 45% and 25%, respectively. For the quarter, we added a third more client account on our demand side platform compared to the prior year and signed key partnerships with leading content and e-commerce companies. As a combination of this strong momentum, Verizon Media won Adweek Readers' Choice Best of Tech Partner Awards for all four nominated categories; DSP, SSP, ad network video and ad network mobile. Let's now move to Slide 13 for a quick look at the overall wireless performance. Slide 13 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services for the consumer and business segments for the second quarter. Total wireless service revenue was down 1.7% over the prior year, including the headwinds mentioned in both the consumer and business segments. Phone gross adds were down 23.3%, while phone net adds were 173,000 as compared to 244,000 in the prior year. Phone churn was 0.58%, down 18 basis points in the prior year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and our supplemental earnings release schedules on our Web site. Now, let\u2019s review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on Slide 14. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $23.6 billion, an increase of $7.7 billion from the prior year. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in the business as well as non-recurring items and timing differences. These items include the COVID-related postponement of approximately $2.0 billion of second quarter tax payments to July 15, the receipt of the previously disclosed $2.2 billion cash tax benefit related to preferred shares in a foreign affiliate sold during the fourth quarter of last year, improvements in working capital primarily due to lower volumes and payments related to the voluntary separation plan in 2019 that did not repeat this year. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $9.9 billion, which was up approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year. At the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expect the capital spending to be more frontend loaded and we see that in our first half results. Our capital expenditures further support capacity for traffic growth across our networks, while we continue to deploy more fiber and additional cell sites to expand our 5G rollout. We maintain our full year 2020 CapEx guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $13.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 74%. Despite the pandemic, our balance sheet was further strengthened in the quarter. We continue to operate with elevated liquidity levels which we believe is appropriate in this environment. During the quarter, we further lowered maturities through year-end 2022 by $3.8 billion with liability management transactions, which also improved overall portfolio borrowing costs. We now have no unsecured bond maturities for the remainder of this year and less than 1 billion in 2021.  Our overall net debt for the quarter decreased sequentially by $5.7 billion. Net unsecured debt totaled $94.4 billion for the quarter resulting in a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio about 2.0x, down slightly from last quarter. Though we are at the high end of our targeted range of 1.75x to 2.0x, we continue to manage our balance sheet under our capital allocation policy. Our estimates at the leverage ratio Standard & Poor's uses for their credit rating analysis is now less than their boundary for an A minus rating. Therefore, we have now met our commitment to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile. Let\u2019s move on to Slide 15 to take a deeper look at the trends we have seen exiting the second quarter. This slide highlights select key metrics of year-over-year results for both the full quarter and the month of June. Our various customer groups experienced a wide range of trends in customer demand during the quarter and exited the period with different trajectories. As restrictions began to ease during the second quarter, we gradually started reopening our company operated stores with limited hours and our new touchless retail approach to further employee and customer safety. At quarter end, more than 50% of our stores were open, up from roughly 30% in April and we expect to be close to fully opened by the end of July, conditions permitting. As a result, we exited the quarter with significantly better levels of consumer activity than at the beginning of the quarter. Consumer postpaid wireless gross adds declined approximately 21% in June, a material improvement over the decline seen in April. In June, upgrades were relatively flat versus the prior year, given pent-up demand, the availability of more 5G devices and a new lower priced iPhone. Despite the increased gross add activity, churn remains historically low in June. In Fios, we transitioned from an initial period of not performing installations to the introduction of Fios in a box in late April to having technicians resume entering customer homes in the beginning of June, and we are constructively working to bring our installation pipeline to normal levels. This activity led to a significant improvement in Fios Internet gross adds in June, which is carried into July. In our Business Group, we have separated results for the different customer groups as they experienced different trends. We continue to see significant pressures in small and medium business. June gross add declines of approximately 23% of small and medium business were in line with the impacts experienced with the onset of the pandemic, while phone churn was marginally higher. Similar to consumer, upgrade activity was more robust in June. While we are encouraged by the June trends, we may see ongoing impacts to this cohort. In April, we highlighted the surge in demand for connectivity within our public sector and certain global enterprise customers. As we exit the quarter, we continue to see robust demand for both phones and connected devices within the public sector. In global enterprise, we experienced the year-over-year reduction in wireless volumes beginning in mid-April, but exit the quarter with improvements in gross add activity. We remain committed to serving the needs of these important customers, including all those on the frontline as they continue to adapt to new ways of doing business. Throughout the quarter, we made a number of voluntary commitments, most notably participating in the FCC's Keep Americans Connected pledge to ease the impact on consumers and small businesses by waiving various fees, agreeing not to disconnect eligible customers for nonpayment and providing increased data to metered customers, among other initiatives. The effect of these commitments, along with reductions in roaming and other usage-based activity, resulted in headwinds on total wireless service revenue in the quarter that were in line with the expectations shared on our first quarter earnings call. Ongoing impacts to customer behavior from the pandemic mean that usage-based revenue, including roaming revenue and travel pass is likely to be suppressed for some time. And we expect total wireless service revenue in the third quarter to increase sequentially and for the year-over-year growth rate to improve from the second quarter and be within a range of negative 1% to flat. We are encouraged by the payment trends of consumers and small businesses that opted in for the Keep Americans Connected pledge with the majority of these accounts making some payments while under the pledge and more than one-third of such accounts current at the end of the pledge. At this time, we have taken no additional bad debt reserve. We continue to monitor payment trends and we\u2019ll reassess as needed. We are working with affected customers and have a long and successful track record in this area. These customers value the communication services that are vital to their everyday lives and we value the longevity of these relationships. To that end, we have enrolled many impacted customers in a repayment program beginning in July, providing extended terms for past due service and device payments. We believe the vast majority of these accounts can be cured over time, but it will heavily depend on the macroeconomic environment. As previously mentioned, declines in Verizon Media revenue were consistent with the anticipated range provided in April. Although trends improved in June and were down approximately 19% as compared to the prior year, advertising is rebounding faster than search with strength in our owned and operated properties. Given this trajectory, we anticipate that the revenue decline percentage in Verizon Media will be in the teens in the third quarter. Now, let\u2019s go to Slide 16 to discuss our guidance and outlook for 2020. We are very pleased with the momentum we saw building throughout the quarter but would also note that a fair amount of uncertainty remains in the operating environment, particularly as many states now confront rising COVID cases and some are re-imposing restrictions. The second quarter demonstrated our ability to produce strong earnings even in a challenging operating environment. We are maintaining the outlook provided in April for adjusted EPS to be within a range of negative 2% to positive 2% for the full year. It is important to note that our guidance assumes no significant deterioration to the macroeconomic environment or material changes to our bad debt reserves. Guidance for other income statement items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate remain unchanged from our initial outlook. As mentioned previously, we are maintaining our full year CapEx guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. At the beginning of the year, we\u2019ve communicated expectations for CapEx to be frontend loaded in 2020 and that is exactly what we have seen. We continue to have good access to the supply chain for equipment and related items and remain confident we can achieve our built-out plans for the year. In summary, I am proud of this team\u2019s performance in the second quarter, adapting to unprecedented circumstances while continuing to make strides moving our business forward. Our balance sheet remains strong and provides us confidence to continue to invest in the business while also supporting all of our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of the year.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. And let me summarize a little bit where I think we stand when we\u2019re now entering the second half of 2020. First of all, I think we are entering with strong fundamentals where the network that is performing very well, I talked about the J.D. Power and the LTE network is really performing well. We\u2019re entering the second part of 2020 with a growth mindset, with a lot of key strategic partnerships as well as activities. Our 5G are, of course, of essence, coming into the second half, but that\u2019s already been built in as we\u2019re building so much in the first half. The way we have been dealing with the pandemic and all the other crisis will continue, of course, in the second half. And I think we are coming in with a good foundation and with a strong brand, but also a strong employee sentiment, how we are actually dealing with the situation. And as I said before, Matt has prepared the balance sheet for us to be strong when it comes to going into the second half. And if I look into the second half of 2020, we\u2019re of course exciting for scaling the 5G to nationwide, scaling the Ultra-Wideband to over 60 cities, scaling the 5G Home to more than 10 cities, and of course start monetizing that. That\u2019s going to be a key focus for our executive team, as well as capturing all the opportunities, especially on the 5G Mobile Edge Compute where our business-to-business applications and the way we\u2019re working with our partners as well as the partners that we have acquired, like BlueJeans. Finally, we also have a lot of customer innovation when it comes to our Mix and Match, as well as how we\u2019re seeing that our customer can follow us on the journey all the way from the limited plan up to the unlimited plan. And as we have heard previously, the way that Ronan and the Verizon Consumer Group has been working in the second quarter, we have continued to gain success with our unlimited. Our customers are moving together with us up the ladder. And we are also continuing to expanding into new customer groups with Visible, Yahoo! Mobile and others. And we\u2019re working to see that we are addressing the full market with opportunities, regardless how the second half will look like in 2020. So, all-in-all, I think we are in very good position for executing and leveraging all the things we now have prepared in the last 18 months. So by that, let me kick it back to Brady for starting the Q&A.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. And just a quick note before we get into Q&A. I just want to remind everybody we\u2019re in a quiet period for CBRS given the auction and the anti-collusion, so the comments we make around this spectrum will be very limited. With that, Angela, let\u2019s get started and take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you very much. Good morning. Matt, thanks for all the color on the trends in June, very helpful. I wonder if you could unpack the $0.14 of COVID impacts and how much of that is sort of particular to Q2 with Keep America Connected plan and what elements do you think will continue on into Q3 and beyond? And related to the outlook, you did talk about some of the SMB pressures, but generally global enterprise wireline revenues were holding up given presumably some increased demand for capacity, et cetera. But how are you seeing \u2013 we\u2019re seeing stories about IT budgets getting cut. Are you seeing any signs that we may see more pressure on that side in the second half of the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can start and Matt will chip in. I can say that in the quarter, Simon, we met so many enterprise customers. And yes, there are of course some that are more hit than others that of course are very cautious on the IT budget. But the majority of the large enterprises, they feel that this is the time to digitalize. This is the time to actually use the momentum to be more digital using capabilities all the way from SD-WAN to video conferencing to 5G Mobile Edge Compute. So I actually see a very good momentum with these type of customers. And I just wanted to chip in there before Matt comes in and comments to COVID 19 impacts. Matt?\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans. Thank you, Simon, for the question. So $0.14 of impact from COVID in the quarter, the vast majority of that is driven by revenue both service revenue within the wireless side of the business, predominately in Consumer but some in Business and then also the impact in Verizon Media Group. So the service revenue, obviously there was a couple of major components to that. One is the actions we took. We talked about the Keep Americans Connected pledge but also the increases to customer data plans, those who aren\u2019t on unlimited, had that during the course of the quarter as well. And then you had the impact from customer behavior, primarily around roaming. So as you think about coming into the third quarter, as we said, we expect service revenue to be better in 3Q than it was 2Q getting closer to flat on a year-over-year basis versus the negative 1.7%. That\u2019s going to come from growing the accounts, growing the net adds that we had coming through but also because we don\u2019t have all of those things taking place in the third quarter at the moment that we had in 2Q. But we do also expect customer behavior to continue to reflect what\u2019s going on. So we certainly don\u2019t expect roaming revenues to be at the levels they would have been without COVID. That will continue. And then you mentioned on the business side, especially within SMB, that\u2019s a customer group we\u2019re paying close attention to in terms of how they navigate this obviously very difficult environment working very closely with them, but certainly there could be some pressure there. But all-in-all, the pressures that we saw in the quarter from COVID were as expected. So we\u2019ll have some of those as we continue into Q3 and see some improvements in other areas as well.\nSimon Flannery: And so it will be below $0.14, but it will still be sort of enduring impact on some --\nMatt Ellis: We\u2019ll wait and see how the environment plays out here, but certainly we can \u2013 some of the things we\u2019d expect to be a little bit better. As we mentioned on Verizon Media Group, they were negative 25% in revenue in Q2. We said we expect that to be in the teens in 3Q. That should give less of an impact there. Service revenue, we hope we\u2019d see a lower impact but we\u2019ll see how the quarter plays out obviously. Over the past 30 days or so, we\u2019ve added a level of uncertainty to the forward view with everything, the number of COVID cases around the country, so we\u2019ll see how the quarter plays out here.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks for the color.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Simon. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess I want to follow up on that answer, Matt. Obviously at the top line, we\u2019re seeing some sequential improvement. The question I think that people have is as you start to see the equipment revenue velocity or the equipment volume velocity improve in third quarter, are we going to see an equal or potential even offsetting effect on margins as we kind of look ahead? And I guess the second question I have would be just kind of zooming out a little bit and thinking about the 5G millimeter wave. Obviously, the critique has been that 5G millimeter wave availability is not that great. Is there any way that you guys can kind of offer some kind of metric or some kind of KPI on 5G millimeter wave availability in the markets where you\u2019ve put it out so we can kind of measure its growth? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Hi, David. Let me start on the millimeter wave and have a discussion about that. So, as I said, we are on plan to deploy more than 5x more millimeter wave base station this year compared to last year, so the footprint will be much broader and we will be into 60 cities and those cities will be much more covered than they were last year. And we are disclosing that \u2013 usually on a fairly frequent basis how that map is growing. As you have seen, we have launched fairly few markets the first half when it comes to the 60, so you should expect quite a lot of noise from us in the second half and we\u2019re really excited about that. But you also need to think about our model will also include nationwide, so think about our model being a millimeter wave that is transformative. No one is even close to it in the world. Then we will have national coverage on top of that. And then in the bottom, we have the best 4G network in the world. And then I don\u2019t think that our customer will be disappointed with that. We build things that are transformative that are so different than others. So I would be excited for the second half if I would be you. It\u2019s crunch time for Verizon. We have been talking about this for one and a half year. I think our customers will be very excited in the second half. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So, David to your question around equipment volume, certainly we saw in June an improvement in the volumes across both consumer and business on the wireless side, but I don\u2019t expect that to have a material impact on volumes in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And it\u2019s largely because of the way we do the accounting now being on the device payment plan model. So you have \u2013 if you get that increase in equipment revenue, you also get kind of very similar increase on the expense side and even any higher commissions and so on under 606 now get recognized over the expected life of that customer. So the increase in volumes should not be causing a significant change in the margin, a hit to the margin there that as you phrased it in the question. One area where the volumes do maybe have an EPS or EBITDA impact is in especially enterprise and public sector where you still have some of those sales on a subsidy model. But overall, the vast majority of our wireless business is now on device payment, and then you get a much closer matching of the revenues and the expenses. So I\u2019m not expecting to see a significant headwind to the EBITDA in 3Q as volumes pick up.\nDavid Barden: Great. Thank you so much, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Dave. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Yes, thanks for taking the question and I was hoping we could just follow up again on the outlook for improving wireless service revenue growth in the third quarter. It sounds like from your comments you\u2019re not expecting any further pressures from fees and usage-based revenues. And so I was hoping you could talk about what\u2019s going on with the mix at an ARPA level? Are you seeing customers continuing upgrading to unlimited plans or has that slowed? And really what\u2019s your outlook for what that pace of upgrading is going to be? And then you did talk about the efforts you\u2019re making to help customers who have had payment issues. Can you give us any update on the number of accounts who are in some type of patient program? And I think the thing most people are really interested in is how many customers had fully stopped making payment at this point in time and what are your assumptions about how you\u2019re going to manage that base in the third quarter as you structure that outlook? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Matt, I think you\u2019re on mute.\nMatt Ellis: There we go. I forgot to come off mute. Brett, thanks for the question. As you think around service revenue, it starts with having more customers as we come into the third quarter than the second quarter. You saw 173,000 adds in the quarter and especially the 97,000 in consumer and adding accounts. So that\u2019s obviously going to help us sequentially with billing those customers. You mentioned some of the fees, we\u2019ll see how those play out, but certainly that will be a factor. The usage from a roaming standpoint, we don\u2019t expect to see that get sequentially better as a large part of our roaming revenue is international and we don\u2019t expect either business or personal travel to be at the levels this year it was last year for some time. So all of those things will play into service revenue being up sequentially, but it starts from increasing the base of our customers as we\u2019ve done for a long time now and that will continue to be the largest driver. We still have the ability to upgrade customers to unlimited. We made further progress on doing that during the course of the quarter and now well over 50% of our base on unlimited. There\u2019s still opportunity to step more customers up there as we go forward. Pivoting to your questions around the customer payment and where we are with Keep Americans Connected pledge, obviously that pledge ended as of June 30. We ended at around 1.5 million accounts, so it was right in line with our expectations 90 days ago. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s most encouraging though is what we\u2019re seeing in terms of payment patterns from the customers. We have approximately a third of the customers are current as of the end of June. I\u2019ve said in the comments that the vast majority have made some payments during that time period. More than 80% of those wireless customers who took the pledge have been making payments. So I am very, very encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen. My expectation is the vast majority of these customers will be customers of ours a year from now.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thank you for that.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brett. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, guys. First, following up on that last comment, Matt. So have you contacted everyone at this point as you\u2019ve gone through July? And I believe you\u2019re on service 60-day cutoff cycle at this point, so you would know by September 1, give or take, who of the pledges is going to come out or not? And then for Hans, can you talk about sort of CapEx priorities and maybe how things might shift over the next year, assuming you get more mid-band spectrum? I know you can\u2019t talk too much about spectrum, but how may capital spending shift there? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Hi, Phi. Thank you for the questions. I\u2019ll go first on the follow-up question, then Hans can answer CapEx. So here\u2019s what we did at the end of the quarter. For those customers who weren\u2019t current \u2013 as I mentioned, more than a third of them were current. So we saw that customers want to continue to pay for the service they get from us. We have a well established process for customers who late pay. We do this every day. We\u2019ve done it for years. But what we did for these customers in the Keep American Connected pledge, we rolled them into a program that took whatever balance they had built up at the end of the pledge and put it to be paid off over a number of months, and so we\u2019ve applied that to them. As you said, because of the billing cycle and so on, we won\u2019t get to see where they are here for another few weeks. We\u2019re watching that closely. But as I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve seen obviously an intent for these customers to continue to pay. We have a great track record of working with customers. And when they have difficult personal circumstances, helping them to get back current over time and allowing them to remain customers and I expect nothing different with this group of customers in this situation.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. And about the CapEx, I\u2019m just looking back at three years that I have been at Verizon, even though the overall absolute number of CapEx has been very stable, what is inside has dramatically changed all the time, because we together with our engineering team is all the time doing the right priorities given the assets we have. One year ago, we didn\u2019t talk about DSS. But of course, our team was working to prepare all the networks so we can actually deploy DSS in all the radio base stations we have. So we constantly are ahead of the game thinking what is needed to be preparing for the network. But right now our focus is very much about the commitments we have to our customers when it comes to 5G, but also to keeping the best network on 4G. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll have it and then do that fiber reach. Those are the priorities and it will continue so. Then any speculation on the future spectrum or something, that\u2019s a little bit early to have right now. But I can tell you my team is always proactively thinking about how to do this network continue to be the best in America. There\u2019s no debate about that. And I have a high confidence that they will continue to do so when it comes to our CapEx allocation as well.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Phil. Okay. Angela, I think we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe a question about wireless competition. Obviously T-Mobile just did some refreshing of their low-end pricing. Do you guys see this as sort of something new or aggressive or is it just sort of regular course of business? And then as we look out into the second half and obviously the industry\u2019s been talking about 5G for a while, we sort of had some pent-up demand given the low upgrades. Do you guys see the launch of the 5G iPhone, which looks like it\u2019s been kicked out into the fourth quarter, as a sort of big event for the industry and one where similar to what happened with the LTE iPhone an opportunity for Verizon to take share? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, John. First of all, I think we\u2019re as prepared as we can be. We have prepared ourselves with our models when it comes to Mix and Match on the consumer side. We have taken out course. We have the best network. I feel very good about the competition. We have always had competition. This is nothing new. So I think Ronan and the team, because that\u2019s primarily where I guess your question is related to. So I think they are well prepared. And as I said, I\u2019m really excited for our second half and what we are doing right now and we are prepared for it. And when it comes to 5G phone from Apple, I can comment on that, but of course it\u2019s a big event whenever it comes because the U.S. market has a very high penetration on iOS. And of course, customers are reluctant to change between the different operating systems. So that\u2019s why a 5G phone from Apple isn\u2019t very important event and especially if you have built the network like us where it\u2019s so transformative that so many customers will be able to feel that transformation and that difference in usage of the network compared to some other networks that will not be a big difference. So I\u2019m excited. I think Ronan is super excited for going into second half and compete. And we have been prepared for this for years and we have been doing it for years.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, Hans.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, John. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rollins: Hi. Good morning and thanks. Two, if I could. First, as you\u2019ve done more with service bundling with things like Disney+, can you share some of the results of customers entering into those bundles and how it\u2019s affecting the economics of your customers? And second, if I go back to when you talked about 5G in the past, you outlined some timeframes of when you thought there would be material financial contributions to the consumer and business segments. And as we\u2019re getting closer to those points in time, I was curious if you can give us an update on where that stands and maybe some examples of the way that you\u2019re anticipating getting that monetization in each of the consumer and business segments? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Michael. Good questions. On the first one, on the bundling we are doing, I think this is a key differentiator for us. What we have been able to do in partnership with the greatest brands that we have on earth and combining that with the best network, the best brand and our distribution. And as I said several times before, our metrics has proven to be far better than we even initially thought, meaning how many have taken the premium from the beginning and how many were converting to paying customers. But not only that, it tells you a difference when you start comparing to competition. What do you get when you work with Verizon? You get not only the best network, you get some of the best services that are running at the moment. And I think that\u2019s unique for us and that\u2019s why if you look at our churn numbers, we are at record low. I think that hangs together for us and we will continue to do so. But we are very picky who we are using. It has to be the right brands. It has to be addressing our full customer base that they really appreciate it. So again, the Verizon Consumer Group with the lead of Ronan and all his team, they are working with it daily. And I would say, we have many services that want to join us because they have seen the model panning out in a very good fashion. The examples you\u2019re mentioning, Disney+ or Apple Music, both of them have I would say have been very successful for both parties and that\u2019s how we see it. On the 5G, when it comes to our commitments and what we outlined when it comes to our revenues, we have not changed. Those are the same. We are gearing for so-called the consumer part of it, Home and mobility in '21 to see some revenues from there and then in '22 from the 5G Mobile Edge Compute. But you\u2019re going to see much more sort of milestones right now of customers, sites and all the early indicators of that we\u2019re heading into that, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to provide you with. You see that now we are preparing for that with announcement. If you think about the Mobile Edge Compute, just last week we announced partnership with IBM and with SAP. That\u2019s going to be part of the 5G Mobile Edge Compute in order to serve our customers. So you\u2019re going to see that how we are doing, sort of laying out early indicators on that path to revenue that we have outlined both internally as well as externally.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Mike. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. Hans, I want to stay with the same theme as the last few questions where we talk about 5G. You\u2019ve talked a lot about Mobile Edge Compute. But I wonder if you could just sort of \u2013 two things. First, drill down a little bit into the actual use cases for 5G that you are seeing from your \u2013 particularly business customers that you think are starting to materialize? And then just \u2013 I wonder if you could just talk about the health of your customers, and I think in particular about municipalities and cities and towns for some of those applications where budgets are now very perilous, but even large enterprises where they\u2019re seeing big downturns because of the recession and how much that really affects the likely uptake of 5G in terms of timelines?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. Good questions. Let me start at the last question. I\u2019ll come back to the others. When we see the customers, I think that first of all, when it comes to our governmental business, as you have seen, that has been really going well for the last few quarters here in the pandemic. Many of these states, municipalities, of course, need to go to new models of delivering services to the students or to the community at large. And that\u2019s why we have seen \u2013 we announced yesterday several different states that are now using our services for remote learning, for example. So, there we see that there is a craving for actually go to digitalization. That\u2019s the only way and that\u2019s not a one-time thing. For me, I think it\u2019s the new normal. We\u2019re going to see that going over. So I\u2019m really encouraged about that and our strength working with these customers. Then, of course, there are some advanced customers. You also heard this week, we together with the Defense Department are now doing 5G tests, et cetera. So they are also both advanced, but also \u2013 so there I feel really good. We have a really good go-to-market. We have great networks, which is the main thing here. Then on the enterprise side, you\u2019re absolutely right. Here you see a divider. Of course, the travel enterprises, the airlines companies, the restaurant large enterprises, they of course are in furlough and actually trying to reduce the costs as much as possible. But on the other hand, you have the large enterprises and actually see the change \u2013 see the opportunity right now to transform. I probably do five to seven large enterprises executive meetings per week right now discussing how to do the digitalization of these enterprises. And many of them are accelerating the plans rather than delaying them. Then, of course, we know that lot of infrastructure is already in place for these enterprises, still it takes time to do it. And this can be SD-WANs, video conferencing, fiber or whatever. So it\u2019s more things we sell today. Then you come to the 5G Mobile Edge Compute. I think that the use cases we see today is very much real-time decision-making. If that\u2019s a big distribution center that\u2019s going to have 5G-enabled distribution center to actually take real-time decisions, or if it\u2019s a big manufacturing plant that\u2019s going to use 5G Mobile Edge Compute by wireless connecting to all the robotics, we\u2019re in many of those cases. And then you also see cases where sort of IoT devices with 5G will actually enable a new way of delivering a service. And finally, the whole VR and AR for large enterprises where you need a low latency on the campus or in the manufacturing or whatever it might be, those are all the early cases. Many of them right now are based on low latency. We see it\u2019s creeping into security because the data can then be contained with the company, meaning they can actually process and have all the processing and storage at the edge, which means they can keep the data for themselves. So those two capabilities are the first one. I think in the next, we\u2019re going to see enormous bandwidth of enterprise that need to send a lot of data to the edge in order to take decisions. But so far, latency and security, that\u2019s how the 5G Mobile Edge Compute scenarios are working out. And we basically have two, three \u2013 or two, I would say, per industry vertical that are lead customers for us. And we work with them to do the solutions and sometimes we are the third party as we don\u2019t have all application ourselves. That\u2019s how we\u2019re working it right now and I\u2019m encouraged. And, of course, as I said before, acceleration has been seen, because all the digitalization and touchless that is needed going forward.\nCraig Moffett: That\u2019s great. Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Craig. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McCormack of Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael McCormack: Hi. Thanks, guys. Hans, maybe just a quick comment again on the enterprise side. So it sounds like you\u2019re not seeing any sort of delayed decision-making contracts that have been in process or still going through. And then secondly, one of your competitors was talking about 5G as a home broadband replacement not really being such a great replacement. Any thoughts around that? And then I guess does that change any of your view on the importance of Fios going forward? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: On the enterprise, to some extent you\u2019re right, because certain customers are delaying and not doing decisions. Those are usually in industries that has huge impact from COVID-19. That\u2019s extremely clear. But we work with them anyhow, because ultimately they are going to be our customers when these come out and those industries will flourish. So we are resilient. We support our customers in good and bad times and our business model is actually working in good and bad times, which is really, really good. So that\u2019s working. The comments on 5G Home from people that are not really doing it, of course, I cannot even comment on that. We feel really good about our model. As we have said before, minimum of 10 5G Home cities. We\u2019re going to have the cities with a much better chipset. That\u2019s on plan for this second half. So, again, we feel good about \u2013 our learnings are deep on building coverage, throughputs and all of that. And the self-install, which I have been talking about now for one and half year, which excites me that our customers should be able to receive the gear, the CPs and be able to install themselves in a short timeframe. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m down to the times that I have envisioned. I wanted to be below one hour, but we have come a far way from the eight hours we started with. And compared to a fiber installation where you need to first put it on the agenda, you wait for a couple of weeks and you have to come there and install it, and it takes hours to do. This is a totally different way. It\u2019s transformative. As I said, we are building 5G that\u2019s transformative, not the me-too to my 4G.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Mike. And special shout out to Mike today. So I heard it\u2019s his birthday. So happy birthday, Mike.\nMichael McCormack: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Supino of Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Supino: Hi. Thank you. On 5G Home, I\u2019m wondering as you look out at the arrival of the high-powered CPE, which I think comes in Q4, what the key unanswered questions are for you in terms of performance and unit economics that would allow you to speak a bit more clearly about expectations? And I\u2019m curious whether you think it can scale in 2021? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I think we\u2019ve answered the majority of the questions when it comes to how we can scale. There are always things. We are at the forefront on technology. We\u2019re first in the world doing this and there is no one even close of thinking it like this. So, of course, there are challenges. We, as an executive team, we sit down once a month, the whole executive team reviewing all this with our engineers to be better all the way from the installation to the marketing. So I feel that we have a good plan. Of course, there are still things outstanding and we can do better over time, but I think we\u2019re in a good place to re-launch when the more powerful CPE is coming, that\u2019s what \u2013 and that should enable us to go into 2021 with a better understanding of how we can scale it and where we will scale it. I think one thing that we have learned also is that, of course, fixed wireless access, we think a lot about consumers, but there is an opportunity clearly when you see this also as a fixed wireless access opportunity for small and medium business, et cetera, that we will start working on later on.\nMatt Ellis: Hi, Peter. It\u2019s Matt. Just a couple of thoughts. One, remember, you\u2019re driving these revenues off of the same network that you are getting 5G mobility revenues on. So this is the first time we\u2019ve had that opportunity to drive multiple revenue streams off of the same investment. And so as we roll out the network, we\u2019ll have the opportunity to add more market share. And so we\u2019re very excited about that as we head into '21 with the progress we\u2019re making this year.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Angela, we have time for one more question. Let\u2019s do one more from the audience here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. I had two for Matt, if I can. One, just given the various moving parts as it relates to free cash flow and some of the bigger benefits you saw in the second quarter that were one-time, I was wondering if you can give some color on what free cash flow could look like for the back half of the year or more simplistically, whether or not you expect free cash flow in 2020 to be above or below that of 2019? And then secondly, as it relates to the upcoming C-band auction, which I know you\u2019re not going to talk too much about, but when you think about how you\u2019re going to finance that, do you think that that point you\u2019ll have enough as it relates to cash on hand and room within your debt financing to pay for what you will ultimately spend at that auction, or do you think that there could be a point where you might have to curtail at least temporarily your level of investment just to ensure that you\u2019re able to get the most out of that auction that you\u2019d want to? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Colby. So in regards to the last question, we\u2019re certainly excited about the opportunities that come with the C-band auction. One of the great things about having got the balance sheet in position that we have is it gives us the opportunity to take advantage of items like that when they come along. And I don\u2019t think that \u2013 as I look at the balance sheet and I look at the auction that that will provide any inhibitor [ph] to us either in terms of what we do in the auction or how we invest in the rest of the business. In terms of the free cash flow, so the second quarter as you say, a couple of items in there. We had the tax benefit from the item that we recognized in the fourth quarter last year. We also had a timing difference of about $2 billion moving just regular cash payments from second quarter to last week. But all-in-all, look, our cash flow will continue to be strong because we have \u2013 obviously we have a strong business with a recurring revenue stream that will continue into the second half of the year. Working capital provided a benefit in the first half with the lower volumes. We\u2019ll see how that plays out in the second half of the year. And I think that will be one of the key determinants of how cash flow looks for the full year on a year-over-year basis. So we\u2019ll see how it plays out, but I certainly expect free cash flow to continue to be strong for the business.\nColby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Colby. And with that, I think we\u2019re going to wrap up the call. And I just want to make sure everybody is safe and thank you for everything today. And Angela, back over to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and thank you, everyone, for joining this earnings call. Let me reiterate what I said in the first quarter. We are in unprecedented times with multiple crises and a business that we need to run at the same time. I can only say to all of you, I'm extremely proud how Verizon and our employees have responded to all of it. I think of this quarter as a quarter where the stakeholder capitalists strategy of Verizon really bear fruit. I have reported many earnings calls in my life. This quarter it comes together with a good support of our employees, a great support to our customers when it comes to our network and our flexibility, a big contribution to our society when it comes to how we acted and supported to the site in these tough times, but also a very good and solid financial result for our shareholders. That's a really good sort of ending of the second quarter or the first half of a very unprecedented year. We have continued as a leadership team to work in a three-prong governance. Part of our team is working with the daily crisis to see that we are doing the right things and with the right priorities in this pandemic, economical downturn, racial injustice that is ongoing in the country. The second part is of course working business as usual and seeing that we continue to lead and deliver results for all our stakeholders. And finally, in a third prong is to work with what are opportunities created from this pandemic, economical downturn so we come out even stronger as a company after this is coming out to a new normal. Our strategy and our underlying strategic priorities have not changed during this time. They have been reconfirmed that we are on the right path with our network-as-a-service and our go to market. Many of the things that we outlined in the Verizon 2.0 are really playing a vital role for us being able to deliver to all our stakeholders, especially to our customers in times like this. One of the transformations was of course to have a purpose-driven company where our employees are very engaged and excited of our future, but also seeing that they're doing the right thing for our society. If I look back on the first half and looking back on our response to the COVID-19, I think we have done very well. We have decided to prioritize the health and safety of our employees. Not only that, we have also started to return to office with very safe protocols to see that our employees actually can work in the offices if they want to. But if you then look at our frontline, which never closed and never worked from home, they have continued to innovate. They innovate with the curbside delivery in our stores, Fios in a box, et cetera. And as Matt will later on talk about, we have seen a great uptake on those innovations when we look into the latter part on the second quarter. If we then talk about the racial injustice that we're seeing in the country the last couple of months, I'm also proud for how we have brought that together with our team to discuss this, having a conversation in the company but also with our partners and externally. No one can say we're done enough and we just need to continue to do that. At the same time, we're donating money for some of the most important foundations that can support that transformation. Finally, I'm also proud that we have packaged all our activities that we are doing for our social stakeholders in what we call the Citizen Verizon. I will not dwell on that today, but is an important piece of our overall strategy. In addition to serving our employees and society, we have of course also been very focused executing on our core business and our core strategy, and continue to develop our platform for a network-as-a-service. I'm extremely pleased to report that once again for the 25th time we are winning the award for the best LTE network from J.D. Power. I have to say the engineers in Verizon have continued to amaze me and they will continue to do so in the future. Remember in February, we made some bold statements about our deployment on 5G in 2020 all the way from the Mobile Edge Compute, 5G Home cities, 5x more small cells on 5G and some 60 cities on the 5G Ultra-Wideband as well as a nationwide coverage on 5G with DSS. I'm happy to report we're on track on that, and in some cases even ahead of the plan. We are continuing to deploy our technology. Our test with DSS is going very well and as well, we have launched some of the 60 markets when it comes to mobility and some additional markets on 5G Home. However, you're going to see that in the second half of this year we have a lot of new things happening and building on the foundation of the strategy and the strategic priorities that Verizon has outlined the last couple of years. If we then look into the different segments and first of all starting with Verizon Consumer Group in the second quarter, continued to gain improvements when it comes to the customer loyalty, not only in national but also by creating new services. We saw them coming up with Verizon credit card in the second quarter and they continued to gain a lot of accounts based on their mix and match and the way we have developed the ladder with different unlimited offerings. I'm really happy what Ronan and his team have done and you're going to see in the financials and operating numbers that even with the challenges we've had, they had performed very well. If you look at the Verizon Business Group that are in the middle of the transformation and I have to say the way they are now dealing with customers are bearing a lot of fruit. They are progressing well with the transformation and I'm also happy to report the acquisition we did in the second quarter of BlueJeans are performing well and the growth both on usage and new customers are continuing going very well. And I was also happy last week to announce a large partnership with Airtel, one of the largest carriers in the world, to use BlueJeans for their corporate customers in India. Finally, on the Verizon Business Group, 5G Mobile Edge Compute, an important piece of our growth strategy, we have said that we are going to have 10 5G Mobile Edge Compute sites this year deployed. And now we've also started gearing up our partners. We have announced IBM and we also talked about SAP as two very important application providers that are going to take part of our deployment and that we're collaborating with right now. So we're creating a lot of excitement around the 5G Mobile Edge Compute and a lot more to come in the second half. Finally, Verizon Media Group, of course being impacted by the advertising markets coming down. We see them coming back a little bit in June, but anyhow they have done also quite a lot of work to see that we continue to create more monthly active users on our owned and operated properties, and they also made an agreement with Walmart, which is of course one of the largest companies on earth to see that they are using Yahoo! Mail as a grocery and purchasing platform. Finally, our financial team under Matt has continued to do good work on our balance sheet. We are coming out from the quarter with elevated liquidity. But not only that, we have continued to work well on our net debt. And we have reached credit metrics levels similar to pre-Vodafone level. So that's really good work by the team. If we look into the financials of the second quarter, and Matt will cover that in more length, I only want to say that we had a very good quarter. We showed resilience. Of course, there are challenges in certain customer groups like Verizon Media Group, small and medium businesses, but many others have actually been performing well. We also need to remember in the quarter we have had not all our stores open when it comes to consumers, as well as limited sort of visiting hours, et cetera. However, if you see in the momentum we have created on the consumer side, we added 26,000 consumer postpaid accounts this quarter, which is, I would say, a good work compared to a loss one year ago in the second quarter. We also are on historical lows on our churn, and all-in-all that is giving us a good EBITDA in the Verizon Consumer Group. Finally, I would just want to highlight the very strong cash flow. Of course, we have some extraordinary tax items there, but in general it was a strong cash flow quarter. And as Matt will talk about later, we have not increased our bad debt reserves in the second quarter and he will also allude to we have good metrics when it comes to what happened in June compared to the rest of the quarter. So all-in-all, I think we have executed well for all our four stakeholders in this quarter. And by that, I hand it over to Matt to go through the financials in more detail. Thank you, Matt. And let me summarize a little bit where I think we stand when we're now entering the second half of 2020. First of all, I think we are entering with strong fundamentals where the network that is performing very well, I talked about the J.D. Power and the LTE network is really performing well. We're entering the second part of 2020 with a growth mindset, with a lot of key strategic partnerships as well as activities. Our 5G are, of course, of essence, coming into the second half, but that's already been built in as we're building so much in the first half. The way we have been dealing with the pandemic and all the other crisis will continue, of course, in the second half. And I think we are coming in with a good foundation and with a strong brand, but also a strong employee sentiment, how we are actually dealing with the situation. And as I said before, Matt has prepared the balance sheet for us to be strong when it comes to going into the second half. And if I look into the second half of 2020, we're of course exciting for scaling the 5G to nationwide, scaling the Ultra-Wideband to over 60 cities, scaling the 5G Home to more than 10 cities, and of course start monetizing that. That's going to be a key focus for our executive team, as well as capturing all the opportunities, especially on the 5G Mobile Edge Compute where our business-to-business applications and the way we're working with our partners as well as the partners that we have acquired, like BlueJeans. Finally, we also have a lot of customer innovation when it comes to our Mix and Match, as well as how we're seeing that our customer can follow us on the journey all the way from the limited plan up to the unlimited plan. And as we have heard previously, the way that Ronan and the Verizon Consumer Group has been working in the second quarter, we have continued to gain success with our unlimited. Our customers are moving together with us up the ladder. And we are also continuing to expanding into new customer groups with Visible, Yahoo! Mobile and others. And we're working to see that we are addressing the full market with opportunities, regardless how the second half will look like in 2020. So, all-in-all, I think we are in very good position for executing and leveraging all the things we now have prepared in the last 18 months. So by that, let me kick it back to Brady for starting the Q&A. I can start and Matt will chip in. I can say that in the quarter, Simon, we met so many enterprise customers. And yes, there are of course some that are more hit than others that of course are very cautious on the IT budget. But the majority of the large enterprises, they feel that this is the time to digitalize. This is the time to actually use the momentum to be more digital using capabilities all the way from SD-WAN to video conferencing to 5G Mobile Edge Compute. So I actually see a very good momentum with these type of customers. And I just wanted to chip in there before Matt comes in and comments to COVID 19 impacts. Matt? Hi, David. Let me start on the millimeter wave and have a discussion about that. So, as I said, we are on plan to deploy more than 5x more millimeter wave base station this year compared to last year, so the footprint will be much broader and we will be into 60 cities and those cities will be much more covered than they were last year. And we are disclosing that \u2013 usually on a fairly frequent basis how that map is growing. As you have seen, we have launched fairly few markets the first half when it comes to the 60, so you should expect quite a lot of noise from us in the second half and we're really excited about that. But you also need to think about our model will also include nationwide, so think about our model being a millimeter wave that is transformative. No one is even close to it in the world. Then we will have national coverage on top of that. And then in the bottom, we have the best 4G network in the world. And then I don't think that our customer will be disappointed with that. We build things that are transformative that are so different than others. So I would be excited for the second half if I would be you. It's crunch time for Verizon. We have been talking about this for one and a half year. I think our customers will be very excited in the second half. Matt? Matt, I think you're on mute. Thank you. And about the CapEx, I'm just looking back at three years that I have been at Verizon, even though the overall absolute number of CapEx has been very stable, what is inside has dramatically changed all the time, because we together with our engineering team is all the time doing the right priorities given the assets we have. One year ago, we didn't talk about DSS. But of course, our team was working to prepare all the networks so we can actually deploy DSS in all the radio base stations we have. So we constantly are ahead of the game thinking what is needed to be preparing for the network. But right now our focus is very much about the commitments we have to our customers when it comes to 5G, but also to keeping the best network on 4G. That's where we'll have it and then do that fiber reach. Those are the priorities and it will continue so. Then any speculation on the future spectrum or something, that's a little bit early to have right now. But I can tell you my team is always proactively thinking about how to do this network continue to be the best in America. There's no debate about that. And I have a high confidence that they will continue to do so when it comes to our CapEx allocation as well. Thank you, John. First of all, I think we're as prepared as we can be. We have prepared ourselves with our models when it comes to Mix and Match on the consumer side. We have taken out course. We have the best network. I feel very good about the competition. We have always had competition. This is nothing new. So I think Ronan and the team, because that's primarily where I guess your question is related to. So I think they are well prepared. And as I said, I'm really excited for our second half and what we are doing right now and we are prepared for it. And when it comes to 5G phone from Apple, I can comment on that, but of course it's a big event whenever it comes because the U.S. market has a very high penetration on iOS. And of course, customers are reluctant to change between the different operating systems. So that's why a 5G phone from Apple isn't very important event and especially if you have built the network like us where it's so transformative that so many customers will be able to feel that transformation and that difference in usage of the network compared to some other networks that will not be a big difference. So I'm excited. I think Ronan is super excited for going into second half and compete. And we have been prepared for this for years and we have been doing it for years. Thank you, Michael. Good questions. On the first one, on the bundling we are doing, I think this is a key differentiator for us. What we have been able to do in partnership with the greatest brands that we have on earth and combining that with the best network, the best brand and our distribution. And as I said several times before, our metrics has proven to be far better than we even initially thought, meaning how many have taken the premium from the beginning and how many were converting to paying customers. But not only that, it tells you a difference when you start comparing to competition. What do you get when you work with Verizon? You get not only the best network, you get some of the best services that are running at the moment. And I think that's unique for us and that's why if you look at our churn numbers, we are at record low. I think that hangs together for us and we will continue to do so. But we are very picky who we are using. It has to be the right brands. It has to be addressing our full customer base that they really appreciate it. So again, the Verizon Consumer Group with the lead of Ronan and all his team, they are working with it daily. And I would say, we have many services that want to join us because they have seen the model panning out in a very good fashion. The examples you're mentioning, Disney+ or Apple Music, both of them have I would say have been very successful for both parties and that's how we see it. On the 5G, when it comes to our commitments and what we outlined when it comes to our revenues, we have not changed. Those are the same. We are gearing for so-called the consumer part of it, Home and mobility in '21 to see some revenues from there and then in '22 from the 5G Mobile Edge Compute. But you're going to see much more sort of milestones right now of customers, sites and all the early indicators of that we're heading into that, and that's what we're trying to provide you with. You see that now we are preparing for that with announcement. If you think about the Mobile Edge Compute, just last week we announced partnership with IBM and with SAP. That's going to be part of the 5G Mobile Edge Compute in order to serve our customers. So you're going to see that how we are doing, sort of laying out early indicators on that path to revenue that we have outlined both internally as well as externally. Thank you, Craig. Good questions. Let me start at the last question. I'll come back to the others. When we see the customers, I think that first of all, when it comes to our governmental business, as you have seen, that has been really going well for the last few quarters here in the pandemic. Many of these states, municipalities, of course, need to go to new models of delivering services to the students or to the community at large. And that's why we have seen \u2013 we announced yesterday several different states that are now using our services for remote learning, for example. So, there we see that there is a craving for actually go to digitalization. That's the only way and that's not a one-time thing. For me, I think it's the new normal. We're going to see that going over. So I'm really encouraged about that and our strength working with these customers. Then, of course, there are some advanced customers. You also heard this week, we together with the Defense Department are now doing 5G tests, et cetera. So they are also both advanced, but also \u2013 so there I feel really good. We have a really good go-to-market. We have great networks, which is the main thing here. Then on the enterprise side, you're absolutely right. Here you see a divider. Of course, the travel enterprises, the airlines companies, the restaurant large enterprises, they of course are in furlough and actually trying to reduce the costs as much as possible. But on the other hand, you have the large enterprises and actually see the change \u2013 see the opportunity right now to transform. I probably do five to seven large enterprises executive meetings per week right now discussing how to do the digitalization of these enterprises. And many of them are accelerating the plans rather than delaying them. Then, of course, we know that lot of infrastructure is already in place for these enterprises, still it takes time to do it. And this can be SD-WANs, video conferencing, fiber or whatever. So it's more things we sell today. Then you come to the 5G Mobile Edge Compute. I think that the use cases we see today is very much real-time decision-making. If that's a big distribution center that's going to have 5G-enabled distribution center to actually take real-time decisions, or if it's a big manufacturing plant that's going to use 5G Mobile Edge Compute by wireless connecting to all the robotics, we're in many of those cases. And then you also see cases where sort of IoT devices with 5G will actually enable a new way of delivering a service. And finally, the whole VR and AR for large enterprises where you need a low latency on the campus or in the manufacturing or whatever it might be, those are all the early cases. Many of them right now are based on low latency. We see it's creeping into security because the data can then be contained with the company, meaning they can actually process and have all the processing and storage at the edge, which means they can keep the data for themselves. So those two capabilities are the first one. I think in the next, we're going to see enormous bandwidth of enterprise that need to send a lot of data to the edge in order to take decisions. But so far, latency and security, that's how the 5G Mobile Edge Compute scenarios are working out. And we basically have two, three \u2013 or two, I would say, per industry vertical that are lead customers for us. And we work with them to do the solutions and sometimes we are the third party as we don't have all application ourselves. That's how we're working it right now and I'm encouraged. And, of course, as I said before, acceleration has been seen, because all the digitalization and touchless that is needed going forward. On the enterprise, to some extent you're right, because certain customers are delaying and not doing decisions. Those are usually in industries that has huge impact from COVID-19. That's extremely clear. But we work with them anyhow, because ultimately they are going to be our customers when these come out and those industries will flourish. So we are resilient. We support our customers in good and bad times and our business model is actually working in good and bad times, which is really, really good. So that's working. The comments on 5G Home from people that are not really doing it, of course, I cannot even comment on that. We feel really good about our model. As we have said before, minimum of 10 5G Home cities. We're going to have the cities with a much better chipset. That's on plan for this second half. So, again, we feel good about \u2013 our learnings are deep on building coverage, throughputs and all of that. And the self-install, which I have been talking about now for one and half year, which excites me that our customers should be able to receive the gear, the CPs and be able to install themselves in a short timeframe. It's not that I'm down to the times that I have envisioned. I wanted to be below one hour, but we have come a far way from the eight hours we started with. And compared to a fiber installation where you need to first put it on the agenda, you wait for a couple of weeks and you have to come there and install it, and it takes hours to do. This is a totally different way. It's transformative. As I said, we are building 5G that's transformative, not the me-too to my 4G. I think we've answered the majority of the questions when it comes to how we can scale. There are always things. We are at the forefront on technology. We're first in the world doing this and there is no one even close of thinking it like this. So, of course, there are challenges. We, as an executive team, we sit down once a month, the whole executive team reviewing all this with our engineers to be better all the way from the installation to the marketing. So I feel that we have a good plan. Of course, there are still things outstanding and we can do better over time, but I think we're in a good place to re-launch when the more powerful CPE is coming, that's what \u2013 and that should enable us to go into 2021 with a better understanding of how we can scale it and where we will scale it. I think one thing that we have learned also is that, of course, fixed wireless access, we think a lot about consumers, but there is an opportunity clearly when you see this also as a fixed wireless access opportunity for small and medium business, et cetera, that we will start working on later on."

            "name": "Matt Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let me echo what Hans said. The second quarter was unlike any other we have seen and I'm extremely proud of our team and our performance. The results demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the agility of our employees to not only adapt to rapidly changing conditions, but to deliver for our customers and communities while also producing strong financial results. Due to the strength of our business model, we delivered a $1.18 of adjusted earnings per share. This includes an estimated net impact due to COVID of approximately $0.14, primarily driven by impacts to wireless service revenue and lower advertising and search revenues from Verizon Media Group. While the company's performance year-to-date has been strong, there is still a high degree of uncertainty regarding when and how quickly the economy will recover. We are confident that we are implementing the right approach to meet demand as consumer and business activity increases. Let's begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results on Slide 7. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenues were $30.4 billion, down 5.1%. Results reflected significant declines in wireless equipment revenue which was down approximately 20% in the second quarter, primarily due to limited in-store engagement and the impact of COVID on customer behavior. As we highlighted in the previous earnings call, consolidated wireless service revenue was impacted by the commitments Verizon made to waive certain fees and provide additional data for our customers as well as significant changes in customer roaming activity during the quarter. In addition, we experienced low advertising and search revenues within Verizon Media Group as customers scaled back their advertising campaigns. Included in the impacts from COVID, adjusted EBITDA was $11.5 billion as compared to $12.1 billion in the prior year. This is primarily the result of the wireless service revenue impacts from lower advertising and search revenues. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.9% as compared to 37.7% in the prior year, and includes headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense that Brady discussed earlier. Through our business excellence program, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $7.2 billion and remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by the end of 2021. We will continue our focus on operational efficiencies even after the current target is achieved. The current environment provides us with the opportunity to explore additional longer-term business transformation initiatives and related cost savings. Let's now turn to our segment results, starting with Consumer Group on Slide 8. Our consumer team quickly pivoted to adapt to the new environment. In mid-March, we temporarily closed the majority of company-operated retail stores and transitioned most of our employees to work from home, including telesales and customer service roles. We optimized our sales channel to drive more activity through online and through telesales, while introducing touchless retail and curbside pickup to streamline the customer experience as we reopened our retail stores. People are depending on connectivity now more than ever and they need reliability and quality of service. And because of that, we are seeing them increasing choose Verizon. For the quarter, we increased postpaid customer accounts by 26,000 as compared to a loss of 34,000 in the prior year, highlighting the momentum in the business and value of the Verizon customer experience. We have seen activity levels increase during the quarter with an expansion of overall volumes in May and June. Customer retention is at an all-time high and is both a function of customer activity as well as a testament to the Verizon network performance and customer experience. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 97,000 for the quarter as compared to 73,000 in the prior year. While phone gross adds were down approximately 26%, we experienced phone churn of 0.51%, an improvement of 21 basis points from a year ago. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low at 3.9% during the quarter, contributing to the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Fios Internet net additions of 10,000 were down sequentially and year-over-year as Fios installations were limited during the quarter due to temporary restrictions put in place on work inside customers homes. Our team responded with innovative solutions and developed self-install capabilities. And beginning in June, we resumed technician in-home visits across our footprint. Fios video net losses were consistent with previous quarters as cord cutting trends continued. Now, let's move to Slide 9 to discuss the consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues were down 4%, primarily driven by significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to low activation levels. This decrease was offset partly by growth of 15% in other revenue, primarily driven by recurring services such as device protection. Wireless service revenue was down 2.7%, primarily driven by declines in roaming, usage and waived fees that accounted for approximately 320 basis points of pressure in the quarter. Consumer EBITDA margin was 47.0%, which was up 50 basis points from the prior year and includes approximately 40 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Margins benefited from lower equipment volumes in the quarter, but as a reminder lower equipment revenue has a limited impact on consumer EBITDA dollars as the segment primarily operates on a device payment model. Now, let's move to Slide 10 to review the Business Group results. Reliable and secure conductivity have never been more critical, as companies continue to adapt to new ways of supporting their employees while simultaneously driving their businesses forward. During the quarter, our business team responded to the challenges of COVID, handling increased traffic needs while also meeting a surge in demand for connectivity and devices, particularly from public sector and enterprise clients. While wireless demand remained high throughout the quarter in public sector, we experienced offsetting pressures in both small and medium business as well as global enterprise. As a result, segment phone gross adds were down approximately 17% from the prior year contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 76,000, down from 171,000 in the year ago period. Business segment phone churn of 0.90% in the quarter was down 7 basis points year-over-year, driven by strength in public sector. Let's now move to Slide 11 to review the business financial performance. Total operating revenues for the business segment were down 3.7% from the prior year. Wireless revenue was down year-over-year due to declines in wireless equipment revenue, offset by 3.1% growth in wireless service revenue primarily driven by small and medium businesses as well as public sector customers. Wireless service revenue growth included approximately 400 basis points of headwinds from lower roaming and usage revenues in the quarter, which are likely to continue in the third quarter. Suspended lines as a percentage of the base have come off the highs we saw earlier in the quarter, but remain above pre-COVID levels. The likelihood of these lines returning to active status is primarily a function of macroeconomic conditions and will be a significant factor in upcoming wireless service revenue growth rates. Operating revenues were also impacted by legacy wireline declines. However, global enterprise wireline revenue was nearly flat in the quarter, a significant improvement primarily resulting from strong demand for advanced communication services during the pandemic. Business EBITDA margin in the quarter was 26.2% as compared to 27.3%, which included approximately 20 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Now let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss Verizon Media Group. As expected, the economic environment around COVID had a meaningful impact on both search and advertisement performance in the quarter. Total revenue was $1.4 billion, down 24.5% compared to last year, primarily as a result of COVID-related impacts. We continue to drive increased customer engagement on our owned and operated properties and saw monthly active users up approximately 4% with strength in both Yahoo! Finance and News, which were up 45% and 25%, respectively. For the quarter, we added a third more client account on our demand side platform compared to the prior year and signed key partnerships with leading content and e-commerce companies. As a combination of this strong momentum, Verizon Media won Adweek Readers' Choice Best of Tech Partner Awards for all four nominated categories; DSP, SSP, ad network video and ad network mobile. Let's now move to Slide 13 for a quick look at the overall wireless performance. Slide 13 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services for the consumer and business segments for the second quarter. Total wireless service revenue was down 1.7% over the prior year, including the headwinds mentioned in both the consumer and business segments. Phone gross adds were down 23.3%, while phone net adds were 173,000 as compared to 244,000 in the prior year. Phone churn was 0.58%, down 18 basis points in the prior year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and our supplemental earnings release schedules on our Web site. Now, let's review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on Slide 14. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $23.6 billion, an increase of $7.7 billion from the prior year. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in the business as well as non-recurring items and timing differences. These items include the COVID-related postponement of approximately $2.0 billion of second quarter tax payments to July 15, the receipt of the previously disclosed $2.2 billion cash tax benefit related to preferred shares in a foreign affiliate sold during the fourth quarter of last year, improvements in working capital primarily due to lower volumes and payments related to the voluntary separation plan in 2019 that did not repeat this year. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $9.9 billion, which was up approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year. At the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expect the capital spending to be more frontend loaded and we see that in our first half results. Our capital expenditures further support capacity for traffic growth across our networks, while we continue to deploy more fiber and additional cell sites to expand our 5G rollout. We maintain our full year 2020 CapEx guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $13.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 74%. Despite the pandemic, our balance sheet was further strengthened in the quarter. We continue to operate with elevated liquidity levels which we believe is appropriate in this environment. During the quarter, we further lowered maturities through year-end 2022 by $3.8 billion with liability management transactions, which also improved overall portfolio borrowing costs. We now have no unsecured bond maturities for the remainder of this year and less than 1 billion in 2021.  Our overall net debt for the quarter decreased sequentially by $5.7 billion. Net unsecured debt totaled $94.4 billion for the quarter resulting in a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio about 2.0x, down slightly from last quarter. Though we are at the high end of our targeted range of 1.75x to 2.0x, we continue to manage our balance sheet under our capital allocation policy. Our estimates at the leverage ratio Standard & Poor's uses for their credit rating analysis is now less than their boundary for an A minus rating. Therefore, we have now met our commitment to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile. Let's move on to Slide 15 to take a deeper look at the trends we have seen exiting the second quarter. This slide highlights select key metrics of year-over-year results for both the full quarter and the month of June. Our various customer groups experienced a wide range of trends in customer demand during the quarter and exited the period with different trajectories. As restrictions began to ease during the second quarter, we gradually started reopening our company operated stores with limited hours and our new touchless retail approach to further employee and customer safety. At quarter end, more than 50% of our stores were open, up from roughly 30% in April and we expect to be close to fully opened by the end of July, conditions permitting. As a result, we exited the quarter with significantly better levels of consumer activity than at the beginning of the quarter. Consumer postpaid wireless gross adds declined approximately 21% in June, a material improvement over the decline seen in April. In June, upgrades were relatively flat versus the prior year, given pent-up demand, the availability of more 5G devices and a new lower priced iPhone. Despite the increased gross add activity, churn remains historically low in June. In Fios, we transitioned from an initial period of not performing installations to the introduction of Fios in a box in late April to having technicians resume entering customer homes in the beginning of June, and we are constructively working to bring our installation pipeline to normal levels. This activity led to a significant improvement in Fios Internet gross adds in June, which is carried into July. In our Business Group, we have separated results for the different customer groups as they experienced different trends. We continue to see significant pressures in small and medium business. June gross add declines of approximately 23% of small and medium business were in line with the impacts experienced with the onset of the pandemic, while phone churn was marginally higher. Similar to consumer, upgrade activity was more robust in June. While we are encouraged by the June trends, we may see ongoing impacts to this cohort. In April, we highlighted the surge in demand for connectivity within our public sector and certain global enterprise customers. As we exit the quarter, we continue to see robust demand for both phones and connected devices within the public sector. In global enterprise, we experienced the year-over-year reduction in wireless volumes beginning in mid-April, but exit the quarter with improvements in gross add activity. We remain committed to serving the needs of these important customers, including all those on the frontline as they continue to adapt to new ways of doing business. Throughout the quarter, we made a number of voluntary commitments, most notably participating in the FCC's Keep Americans Connected pledge to ease the impact on consumers and small businesses by waiving various fees, agreeing not to disconnect eligible customers for nonpayment and providing increased data to metered customers, among other initiatives. The effect of these commitments, along with reductions in roaming and other usage-based activity, resulted in headwinds on total wireless service revenue in the quarter that were in line with the expectations shared on our first quarter earnings call. Ongoing impacts to customer behavior from the pandemic mean that usage-based revenue, including roaming revenue and travel pass is likely to be suppressed for some time. And we expect total wireless service revenue in the third quarter to increase sequentially and for the year-over-year growth rate to improve from the second quarter and be within a range of negative 1% to flat. We are encouraged by the payment trends of consumers and small businesses that opted in for the Keep Americans Connected pledge with the majority of these accounts making some payments while under the pledge and more than one-third of such accounts current at the end of the pledge. At this time, we have taken no additional bad debt reserve. We continue to monitor payment trends and we'll reassess as needed. We are working with affected customers and have a long and successful track record in this area. These customers value the communication services that are vital to their everyday lives and we value the longevity of these relationships. To that end, we have enrolled many impacted customers in a repayment program beginning in July, providing extended terms for past due service and device payments. We believe the vast majority of these accounts can be cured over time, but it will heavily depend on the macroeconomic environment. As previously mentioned, declines in Verizon Media revenue were consistent with the anticipated range provided in April. Although trends improved in June and were down approximately 19% as compared to the prior year, advertising is rebounding faster than search with strength in our owned and operated properties. Given this trajectory, we anticipate that the revenue decline percentage in Verizon Media will be in the teens in the third quarter. Now, let's go to Slide 16 to discuss our guidance and outlook for 2020. We are very pleased with the momentum we saw building throughout the quarter but would also note that a fair amount of uncertainty remains in the operating environment, particularly as many states now confront rising COVID cases and some are re-imposing restrictions. The second quarter demonstrated our ability to produce strong earnings even in a challenging operating environment. We are maintaining the outlook provided in April for adjusted EPS to be within a range of negative 2% to positive 2% for the full year. It is important to note that our guidance assumes no significant deterioration to the macroeconomic environment or material changes to our bad debt reserves. Guidance for other income statement items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate remain unchanged from our initial outlook. As mentioned previously, we are maintaining our full year CapEx guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. At the beginning of the year, we've communicated expectations for CapEx to be frontend loaded in 2020 and that is exactly what we have seen. We continue to have good access to the supply chain for equipment and related items and remain confident we can achieve our built-out plans for the year. In summary, I am proud of this team's performance in the second quarter, adapting to unprecedented circumstances while continuing to make strides moving our business forward. Our balance sheet remains strong and provides us confidence to continue to invest in the business while also supporting all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of the year. Thank you, Hans. Thank you, Simon, for the question. So $0.14 of impact from COVID in the quarter, the vast majority of that is driven by revenue both service revenue within the wireless side of the business, predominately in Consumer but some in Business and then also the impact in Verizon Media Group. So the service revenue, obviously there was a couple of major components to that. One is the actions we took. We talked about the Keep Americans Connected pledge but also the increases to customer data plans, those who aren't on unlimited, had that during the course of the quarter as well. And then you had the impact from customer behavior, primarily around roaming. So as you think about coming into the third quarter, as we said, we expect service revenue to be better in 3Q than it was 2Q getting closer to flat on a year-over-year basis versus the negative 1.7%. That's going to come from growing the accounts, growing the net adds that we had coming through but also because we don't have all of those things taking place in the third quarter at the moment that we had in 2Q. But we do also expect customer behavior to continue to reflect what's going on. So we certainly don't expect roaming revenues to be at the levels they would have been without COVID. That will continue. And then you mentioned on the business side, especially within SMB, that's a customer group we're paying close attention to in terms of how they navigate this obviously very difficult environment working very closely with them, but certainly there could be some pressure there. But all-in-all, the pressures that we saw in the quarter from COVID were as expected. So we'll have some of those as we continue into Q3 and see some improvements in other areas as well. We'll wait and see how the environment plays out here, but certainly we can \u2013 some of the things we'd expect to be a little bit better. As we mentioned on Verizon Media Group, they were negative 25% in revenue in Q2. We said we expect that to be in the teens in 3Q. That should give less of an impact there. Service revenue, we hope we'd see a lower impact but we'll see how the quarter plays out obviously. Over the past 30 days or so, we've added a level of uncertainty to the forward view with everything, the number of COVID cases around the country, so we'll see how the quarter plays out here. Yes. So, David to your question around equipment volume, certainly we saw in June an improvement in the volumes across both consumer and business on the wireless side, but I don't expect that to have a material impact on volumes in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And it's largely because of the way we do the accounting now being on the device payment plan model. So you have \u2013 if you get that increase in equipment revenue, you also get kind of very similar increase on the expense side and even any higher commissions and so on under 606 now get recognized over the expected life of that customer. So the increase in volumes should not be causing a significant change in the margin, a hit to the margin there that as you phrased it in the question. One area where the volumes do maybe have an EPS or EBITDA impact is in especially enterprise and public sector where you still have some of those sales on a subsidy model. But overall, the vast majority of our wireless business is now on device payment, and then you get a much closer matching of the revenues and the expenses. So I'm not expecting to see a significant headwind to the EBITDA in 3Q as volumes pick up. There we go. I forgot to come off mute. Brett, thanks for the question. As you think around service revenue, it starts with having more customers as we come into the third quarter than the second quarter. You saw 173,000 adds in the quarter and especially the 97,000 in consumer and adding accounts. So that's obviously going to help us sequentially with billing those customers. You mentioned some of the fees, we'll see how those play out, but certainly that will be a factor. The usage from a roaming standpoint, we don't expect to see that get sequentially better as a large part of our roaming revenue is international and we don't expect either business or personal travel to be at the levels this year it was last year for some time. So all of those things will play into service revenue being up sequentially, but it starts from increasing the base of our customers as we've done for a long time now and that will continue to be the largest driver. We still have the ability to upgrade customers to unlimited. We made further progress on doing that during the course of the quarter and now well over 50% of our base on unlimited. There's still opportunity to step more customers up there as we go forward. Pivoting to your questions around the customer payment and where we are with Keep Americans Connected pledge, obviously that pledge ended as of June 30. We ended at around 1.5 million accounts, so it was right in line with our expectations 90 days ago. I'll tell you what's most encouraging though is what we're seeing in terms of payment patterns from the customers. We have approximately a third of the customers are current as of the end of June. I've said in the comments that the vast majority have made some payments during that time period. More than 80% of those wireless customers who took the pledge have been making payments. So I am very, very encouraged by what we've seen. My expectation is the vast majority of these customers will be customers of ours a year from now. Hi, Phi. Thank you for the questions. I'll go first on the follow-up question, then Hans can answer CapEx. So here's what we did at the end of the quarter. For those customers who weren't current \u2013 as I mentioned, more than a third of them were current. So we saw that customers want to continue to pay for the service they get from us. We have a well established process for customers who late pay. We do this every day. We've done it for years. But what we did for these customers in the Keep American Connected pledge, we rolled them into a program that took whatever balance they had built up at the end of the pledge and put it to be paid off over a number of months, and so we've applied that to them. As you said, because of the billing cycle and so on, we won't get to see where they are here for another few weeks. We're watching that closely. But as I've mentioned, we've seen obviously an intent for these customers to continue to pay. We have a great track record of working with customers. And when they have difficult personal circumstances, helping them to get back current over time and allowing them to remain customers and I expect nothing different with this group of customers in this situation. Hi, Peter. It's Matt. Just a couple of thoughts. One, remember, you're driving these revenues off of the same network that you are getting 5G mobility revenues on. So this is the first time we've had that opportunity to drive multiple revenue streams off of the same investment. And so as we roll out the network, we'll have the opportunity to add more market share. And so we're very excited about that as we head into '21 with the progress we're making this year. Thanks, Colby. So in regards to the last question, we're certainly excited about the opportunities that come with the C-band auction. One of the great things about having got the balance sheet in position that we have is it gives us the opportunity to take advantage of items like that when they come along. And I don't think that \u2013 as I look at the balance sheet and I look at the auction that that will provide any inhibitor [ph] to us either in terms of what we do in the auction or how we invest in the rest of the business. In terms of the free cash flow, so the second quarter as you say, a couple of items in there. We had the tax benefit from the item that we recognized in the fourth quarter last year. We also had a timing difference of about $2 billion moving just regular cash payments from second quarter to last week. But all-in-all, look, our cash flow will continue to be strong because we have \u2013 obviously we have a strong business with a recurring revenue stream that will continue into the second half of the year. Working capital provided a benefit in the first half with the lower volumes. We'll see how that plays out in the second half of the year. And I think that will be one of the key determinants of how cash flow looks for the full year on a year-over-year basis. So we'll see how it plays out, but I certainly expect free cash flow to continue to be strong for the business."

At this time, all participants have been pleased in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now, let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $1.4 billion, including a loss on spectrum licenses related to Auction 103 of $1.2 billion, and a net charge of $182 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liability. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.26 in the first quarter, up 5% compared to $1.20 a year ago. Let's now move to slide four and take a closer look at our first quarter earnings profile. We expect 2020 to be the final year that the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition will have a material year-over-year impact on our income statements. As we illustrated in previous quarters, we realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 during the first quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.03 for the quarter. For full year 2020 we expect headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09. We estimate there was a negative $0.04 net impact included in the reported and adjusted EPS from COVID during the quarter. Matt will go through this in more detail later. Adjusted EPS growth of 5% over the prior year illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide reflects the strong underlying performance of the business, partially offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to walk you through a recap of the actions we have taken during this unprecedented time.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and most welcome to this earnings call. This is an earnings call that is very different from all previous ones that I have done. I've been in crisis -- in the telecom crisis in 2000, bank crisis in 2008 and 2009. This is something totally different. It's a health crisis with a pandemic that impacts each and every one of us wherever you are in this world. I'm proud of the team of Verizon, how we have been backing up in this crisis, and how we work together. We decided very early on to split our team in our crisis management team, and the leadership team continued to drive our business forward. In the middle of February, we made that split in order to see that we're actually attending all the things that\u2019s happening in a company the size of Verizon. Our COVID-19 response has been based on how we manage our four stakeholders. We have taken decisive action, but they're all balanced and thinking about the long-term and the positive impact for all our stakeholders. Let me quickly go over what we have done in different areas of stakeholders. On the employee side, the majority of all our employees are working from home. We moved quickly to a work-from-home environment. Today, we have high productivity in that setup. We have also retrained some 20,000 of our own employees to work with new tasks and work from home, and some additional 1,000 of third parties that is part of our delivery. But we also need to acknowledge we have a lot of our employees in frontline, serving customers, keeping up the networks at the same time as keeping some of our stores open. We have roughly 30% of our stores open, of course, with limited opening times and also only by appointment. But they are playing a vital role to keep up the most important infrastructure in this country right now besides hospitals and first responders, and I'm happy to report the team is doing a great job. And talking about our customers, we have been attending all our customers with new demands during this crisis. At the same time, we are also part of the pledge of Keep Americans Connected, which means that we are waiving late fees or overages for small and medium businesses and the residential customers that have been impacted by the coronavirus. Our network has performed well. I will come back to that a little bit later. When it comes to our work in the society, helping communities, that's also extremely important right now. Large corporations need to take the responsibility. We have done some of it like the PayItForward, which is our concert side, sometimes three times a week which is gathering concerts or celebrities, bringing in people actually adding to and helping small and medium businesses. We call it PayItForwardLIVE. But also work with WHO and other organization that needs help and ultimately supporting the most vulnerable in our society. Finally, on the education side that we always have been focused on, we're not only supporting the schools that had already had their support for, but we're also adding together New York Times offering all the content from New York Times to all the high school students across the country. So, we're proud what we're doing in that area. And finally on the financials, we have also worked quite a lot with what we're doing in our cost side. We're taking already cost measurements in the first quarter, everything from third-party spending, seeing of course that we're traveling less but we're doing this prudently as usual. On top of that, we increased the CapEx guidance in the quarter because we felt that it was a good time for us to continue to see that we have robust networks as we went into a moment in time we don't really know how the network would be used. At the same time, of course sending a message that we think is a good return on investment on that incremental CapEx. At the same time, I think, Matt and his team have done a great job of seeing that our balance sheet is in the best shape, added liquidity in the middle of the quarter through very cost-effective bond costs that we had. And we are also working with scenario planning. Nobody really knows how this is going to end, but we have several scenarios and actions that we're working with as a leadership team. Let me talk about the network a little bit, and we have been reporting every week the development of our network since the outbreak of the pandemic. And you are seeing some staggering numbers like over 200% up on gaming, 10 times up on collaboration tools, 40% up on video. 800 million calls a day, which is twice the amount of what we have on Mother's Day which is the biggest day a year. All that we have been managing very well with the network. We have built a robust network and we can deliver high quality. If we then look now week-to-week, you can see on the slide that we have much less of changes. We feel that we have settled in on the type of usage of the network and where it's used. So it's very small variation. I just want to point out the mobile handoffs, which is basically how our customers are moving between different cells down 35% since the outbreak of the COVID-19. And in certain places like New York City it's over 50% reductions on mobile handoff. So how our network hold up then when it comes to all those changes? This is how we show during the Investor Day the -- how our capacity versus the busy hours in the wireless network. As you can see we continue to keep the same headroom in the network when we come into the COVID-19. And the main reason is that, first of all, we were prepared. We have added capacity. But also the network is using different time frames and with different applications. And this exclude any use of the AWS-3 temporary spectrum that SEC so greatly lended to us in the beginning of this crisis as an insurance if usage would go somewhere we wouldn't know. But however, I can report that our technicians and our operations team has done a fantastic job and the network is keeping up very well with the changes and the enormous usage of the network. Let me finish up before I hand over to Matt and talking about the progress towards our 2020 commitment. They are intact. We work to see that we can both handle this crisis, which is unprecedented, but we also continue to execute on our strategy. When it comes to strengthen our core business and grow our core business of course we right now have more digital sales than we had before which is of course very encouraging. But we also strengthened our core business by adding a very good and nice piece of millimeter wave spectrum that gives us very good holdings for four to five strategy. When it comes to leverage our assets and we're growing in the future our 5G plans and our fiber plans the build out of that are on plan. We were also a little bit ahead of plan when we ended the first quarter. And can I report still today we are on plan with the 5G and fiber. Of course, our challenge is out there when it comes to COVID-19 and so on. But our team are finding new ways and innovative ways to actually do the deployment. There are ways of dealing with approvals from the municipalities set by new ways. And we have great collaborations from many of the municipalities to do it. There might be problems going forward but I am also confident that my team are very innovative in the field and see that we continue to drive hard on this. We also added an acquisition just recently the BlueJeans acquisition, adding to what Matt and I said in the fourth quarter talking about the investment we want to do in our Verizon Business Group where we see great opportunity and, of course, then accentuated in this COVID-19 where we now add the BlueJeans capabilities both to our existing distribution, but also for the future of 5G where we think there are video capabilities that's going to be extremely important. On the financial discipline we continue to drive that. Matt is leading that work both preplanning and what we're doing. And finally about our purpose-driven company, which is so important this time to see that you have all your employees with you. We are doing a lot of impact in the society. We have virtual volunteering right now where a lot of our employees can actually contribute to the society in these tough times. And finally, we also actually communicate with our employees basically every day on a live webcast in order to see that everyone knows what we're doing and where we're going in times of uncertainty. Quickly on the first quarter, Matt will cover it much better. I'm proud of the team delivering strong growth in wireless service revenue, but also the 5% growth on our adjusted earnings, which includes impact of COVID-19 and then a strong cash flow up 26% year-over-year. The segments all had their challenges, but also their strength in this quarter. Mainly, the challenges come from COVID-19. Finally on the guidance, we decided to continue to do certain guidance even there are certain un-clarities in the market and of the future. We decided that revenue we will not guide on the revenue, because the hardware is so hard to predict at this moment. But we actually are guiding on EPS and continue with all other items as well. And Matt will go through that in detail, but always with the understanding that we don't have all the knowledge what will going to happen. We may need to make assumptions about it. By that, I hand it over to Matt.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. As Hans discussed, we are in an unprecedented time. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the various measures taken to address the emergency, we experienced starkly different trends during the first two and half months of the first quarter than we did during the last few weeks. We understand that most of you are more interested in what we are currently seeing in the business, so I'll go through the quarterly results at a high level and spend more time addressing the most recent trends and how they impact our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. We will begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results. In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $31.6 billion, down 1.6%. Growth in wireless service revenue in both the Consumer and Business segments was offset by sharp reductions in equipment revenue. Consolidated wireless equipment revenue was down over 16% in the first quarter driven by the Consumer segment, primarily as a result of the limited in-store customer engagement in March, due to COVID. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 billion, down slightly from last year, including the impact from COVID. Low wireless volumes in Consumer Group drove benefits to margins through decreased promotional spend lower equipment revenue and improved churn. These benefits were more than offset by higher bad debt expense, lower advertising revenues from Verizon Media Group in March and customer actions that resulted in a decrease in wireless fees and non-recurring usage charges. Our incremental bad debt reserve of $228 million was the largest component of these items. The headwinds from the deferral of commission expense that Brady highlighted earlier reduced EBITDA by $172 million, which is an impact of approximately 55 basis points to EBITDA margin in the quarter. We have continued to focus on our Business Excellence program with the goal to realize $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by the end of 2021, and have saved $6.3 billion through the end of the first quarter. The activities of this program over the past two years have put us in a position to be more agile and adaptive in uncertain times like these. Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $1.26, up 5.0% from $1.20 a year ago. This included an estimated net impact from COVID of approximately $0.04, primarily driven by an increase of our bad debt reserve. Let's now turn to our segment results starting with Consumer Group on slide 10. Our Consumer team continues to deliver best-in-class services to our customers, while keeping them connected in their personal and work communities. We are extremely proud of the team's performance particularly our frontline workers' efforts to meet our customers' needs during this very difficult period. Our Consumer segment started the year with typical low seasonal volumes during the first quarter. In March, customer transaction activity slowed significantly, due to shelter-in-place policies, travel restrictions and other measures taken to promote social distancing. Later in the call, I will go into a deeper discussion on the exit rate trends as we serve our customers in this new environment. First quarter phone gross adds were down nearly 13% year-over-year and postpaid phone net losses were just over 300,000 for the quarter. Phone churn performance was solid throughout the quarter at 0.77%, which was down four basis points from a year ago. Consistent with first quarter seasonal volume activity and the impact of COVID our retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low during the quarter and is one of the key contributing factors to the decline in wireless equipment revenue. We expect this trend to continue for as long as social distancing policies and other safety measures to protect our employees and customers continue to limit store traffic. Fios Internet net additions of 59,000 were up sequentially and year-over-year, as work from home in-home schooling and other related measures increased the utility and demand for our high-quality broadband offerings. Fios video net losses accelerated for the quarter, and we expect cord cutting trends to continue. In order to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, while providing critical network services, we have modified our approach over the past few weeks and are not currently entering customer locations except for critical functions. Now, let's move to slide 11 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Our Consumer segment entered 2020 with strong momentum, as we added a significant number of wireless connections towards the end of 2019, which favorably impacted the first quarter. For our Fios consumer products, we launched new Mix & Match pricing early in the quarter, providing price transparency and choice in our broadband and video offerings. We also introduced Yahoo Mobile to expand our wireless offerings across our digital media customer base. We continue to generate strong service revenue and other revenue growth. But this was more than offset by a significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to low volume activity. Consumer segment total revenue was down 1.7% year-over-year. The growth in unlimited plans increase in connections per account and high demand for our broadband services in the quarter drove strong profitability for the segment, offset by an increase in bad debt expense as a result of COVID impacts. Consumer EBITDA margin of 46.4% was up 60 basis points over the prior year and included approximately 80 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Lower equipment revenue had a limited impact on our overall EBITDA performance. Now let's move to slide 12 to review the Business Group results. During a time when connectivity is providing critical support to those impacted by this crisis, our Business team is at the forefront to serve our enterprise, small and medium business, public sector and wholesale customers. We remain an outstanding partner for first responders, healthcare providers and other frontline workers. And as Hans mentioned, we are extremely proud of our team's work to deliver essential services to our customers so they can serve others. Business trends were strong throughout the quarter, and we saw heightened demand for our products and services in March. Businesses need our services now more than ever as we saw strong demand for mobility, Jetpacks, VPN services and high-speed circuit capacity in the first quarter. As you look at the detail on the slide for wireless products, you can see phone gross adds were up 25% from the prior year driven by strength in global enterprise and public sector with offsetting pressure in small and medium business. This contributed to postpaid phone net adds of 239,000 and total postpaid net adds of 475,000. Business segment phone churn of 1.02% in the quarter was flat year-over-year driven by strength in public sector with offsetting pressure in small and medium business. Let's now move to slide 13 to review the business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment in the first quarter were down approximately 0.5% from the prior year. Wireless revenues within enterprise SMB and public sector were up year-over-year driven by strong wireless service revenue growth of 6.9%. This was offset by legacy wireline and wholesale revenue declines. We are encouraged by the business EBITDA performance in the first quarter, which was driven by tight controls around spending and strong wireless performance as we generated solid profitability even with higher than usual volumes and the ongoing transformation investments in the segment for future growth. Now let's move on to slide 14 to discuss Verizon Media Group. During the first quarter, Verizon Media Group's performance was impacted by COVID similar to others in the digital advertising and search business. Total revenue is $1.7 billion, down 4% compared to last year, driven almost entirely by COVID impacts. Prior to COVID, our year-over-year revenue trends were continuing the steady improvement seen in 2019. We are seeing increased levels of customer engagement across our platforms. But advertising rates and search revenue have declined in the current environment. Verizon Media launched a coronavirus hub on Yahoo! News and Yahoo! Finance and COVID-19's newsletter through Yahoo Mail, both of which are driving significant customer engagement as we aim to keep users informed on what is happening in their area and around the globe with trusted content. Let's now move to slide 15 for a quick look at the overall wireless performance. Slide 15 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segment for the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue grew 1.9% over the prior year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and our supplemental earnings release's schedules on our website. Now let's review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on slide 16. Cash flow from operating activities was $8.8 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from the prior year. This year-over-year growth was partially driven by Voluntary Separation Program payments and the voluntary pension contributions in the first quarter of 2019 that did not repeat this year as well as working capital improvements from our operations this quarter. Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $5.3 billion, which is up approximately $1 billion year-over-year. We expect the timing of capital spending to be more front-end loaded than it was last year. Our capital expenditures continue to support capacity for unprecedented traffic growth across our networks while we continue to deploy more fiber and add additional cell sites to support our 5G rollout. As we mentioned earlier in March, we increased our full year 2020 CapEx guidance to $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion in order to facilitate Verizon's network activity and help support the economy during this period of disruption. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.6 billion, which was up 26.2% year-over-year and continues to fund our dividend. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with very low unsecured bond maturities through the end of 2021. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.1 times, up slightly from year-end. Let's move on to slide 17 to take a deeper look at the trends we have seen in the last half of March and into early April. During the month of March as COVID safety measures were implemented with new federal and state recommendations for social distancing, our retail consumer and small business activity diminished significantly. By the middle of March, we saw a dramatic shift in customer behavior as stores closed and other business activity halted across the country. At the same time, we experienced increased demand from our public sector and some large enterprise customers to support frontline crisis responders, new work from home and home schooling arrangements and other demands for critical connectivity services. This slide provides selected metrics from March 15 through April 15 and offers a more in-depth view of the early impacts of the current COVID environment. At this point it is unclear how long these trends will continue. In our Consumer Group we closed nearly 70% of our company-operated retail stores and reduced in-store services throughout the day for social distancing safety measures. As you can see on this slide we experienced a significant drop in customer activity and device volumes during this period. Consumer wireless gross adds declined nearly 50% from the same period in the prior year and upgrades declined over 40%. As expected lower customer switching across the entire industry has led to a significant improvement in phone churn. As part of the industry's effort to help customers we signed the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge in March and will waive any late fees and keep customers connected in the event of nonpayment due to the pandemic for the period of the pledge. We have added 15 gigabits of data to metered consumers and small business plans and also to hotspot usage for unlimited plans. This additional data along with increased in-home WiFi usage has resulted in lower data overage revenue in the quarter. In addition to these customer-focused actions and impacts consumer behavior has changed dramatically over this short time period such as reduced international roaming revenue. In order to keep our employees and customers safe through social distancing, we are generally not performing installations for consumer Fios when work inside the home would be required. Gross adds are currently limited to those that can be performed directly by the customer or with the technician working outside the home. In our Business group, we have broken out the trends for our small and medium business customer group showing the drop-off that we have seen in gross adds and upgrades as a major portion of small businesses have seen a steep reduction in activities and in many cases a full shutdown. In contrast to Consumer we are not seeing the same improvement in churn at this time. For public sector and some global enterprise customers, we have seen an increased demand for remote connectivity solutions as a greater number of people are working and schooling from home. Wireless gross adds for these customers were up 163% over the similar period in the prior year, mostly driven by demand for phones, Jetpacks and other connected devices. Our network superiority and long-standing relationship with enterprises first responders and other workers in the fronts has given us the ability to support their connectivity needs across the country when they need Verizon most. In addition to the increase in gross adds activity, we have seen an improvement in retention for our enterprise and public sector customers with phone churn improving by 35 basis points during this period. We are working with all of our customers during this time to ensure they stay connected even if they're experiencing financial hardship as a result of COVID. We believe that our enterprise, public sector and wholesale customers will be relatively less impacted than our SMB customers initially, but we may see increased long-term risk from the crisis. Wireless service revenues in our Business Group are being impacted by reductions in overage fees, a reduction in international roaming and an increase in suspension of lines. Across Consumer and Business, we believe total wireless service revenue growth to be 3 to 5 percentage points lower than originally expected in the second quarter as a result of the reduction in fees and usage-based revenues. Additionally, bad debt expense increased as a result of our changing expectations around customer payments during this time. In the first quarter, we increased our bad debt reserve by $228 million based on the expected number of customers who will avail themselves of payment relief under the Keep Americans Connected Pledge. We will continue to monitor Consumer and Business payment behavior and we'll work with our customers to help them stay connected despite difficult circumstances. As a result it is possible that additional bad debt reserves may be required in the second quarter. In Verizon Media, we are experiencing a decline in advertising and search revenue as advertisers pause, hold back or cancel campaigns during this time and users are searching for fewer commercial terms providing us with less opportunity for monetization. As a result, advertising revenues declined by nearly 10% in the month of March with COVID mostly impact in the second half of the month and that rate of decline has increased in April. A number of industry forecasts expect a 20% to 30% decline in digital media revenues in 2Q and Verizon Media's results are likely to be similar to those experienced in the broader industry. Now let's go to Slide 18 to discuss our guidance and outlook for 2020. Obviously, the environment we find ourselves in today is vastly different than when we originally gave guidance just a few months ago. Given the unprecedented magnitude of the conditions we have all experienced, we are updating our financial guidance for the full year. We remain confident in our strategy our business model and our ability to generate sustainable long-term earnings growth. Our consolidated revenue guidance of low to mid-single-digit percent growth that we announced in January included the expectation that 2020 equipment revenues would not create similar year-over-year headwinds as it has in the past few years. However, device activations have been low since mid-March and we expect that to continue throughout the second quarter with uncertainty around customer behavior for the remainder of the year. The wide range of potential outcomes around equipment revenue led us to determine that it is prudent to withdraw our consolidated revenue guidance at this time. For adjusted EPS, we are revising our original guidance of 2% to 4% growth and are now guiding to a range of negative 2% to positive 2% change from the prior year. Our new estimated range is based on a scenario that assumes significant headwinds prevail throughout the second quarter. We have limited visibility into the second half of the year, which will depend on various potential operating environments. We will continue to assess the impact of COVID on our business, including our bad debt reserve and expect to provide an update on our next earnings call based on how things develop between now and then. Other income statement items for which we provided guidance including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate remain intact as originally guided. As we mentioned earlier, we have maintained our CapEx guidance for the full year that we announced in March. Our supply chain remains strong and we have not seen a material slowdown in the sourcing of necessary equipment from our network and device partners. We are optimistic that the measures government agencies have taken will provide support to citizens, businesses and the frontline responders that have been impacted by this crisis. We remain keenly focused on doing our part to provide best-in-class network performance and customer experience to all of our customers, which will continue to drive long-term operational and financial success, while weathering short-term disruptions. Despite the extreme nature of what the world is experiencing, we believe that Verizon is well suited to remain resilient through this situation. Let's take a look at slide 19 to discuss our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Over the past few years, we have strengthened our balance sheet and the results of those actions have put us in a good position to manage through the impacts of the COVID pandemic. We ended the first quarter with $7 billion of cash on hand. Carrying a higher cash balance during a market crisis is part of our liquidity planning strategy and we executed on that strategy with a $3.5 billion bond offering completed in March. In addition, we started and ended the first quarter with no commercial paper outstanding, but have accessed this market in the second quarter to further enhance our liquidity. During the first quarter and before the market disruption we also completed one of our largest device payment securitizations of $1.6 billion. Having a cash cushion is prudent right now for many reasons, including our expectation that certain customers may have difficulty making timely payments as a result of the crisis. We are closely monitoring these trends, with regard to their impact on our ABS programs. In the second quarter, we had some nonrecurring cash outflows including $2.7 billion of maturities and $1.3 billion of spectrum licenses from Auction 103. Scheduled unsecured bond maturities for the rest of 2020 are zero as a result of our continued liability management strategy that keep near-term maturities low. Additionally, at the end of 2019, given our funded status and prior discretionary contributions, we expect no mandatory contributions to our pension plan until 2026 subject to market conditions. Our pension funded status has been further protected in recent years as we have increased the hedge ratio of our liability to about 50%. This resulted in the funded status of our pension plan only declining from 92% at year-end to 87% at the end of first quarter. Our standby credit facility with our bank group of $9.5 billion provides further assurance of our liquidity. Our balance sheet is strong and our liquidity position has been further strengthened, as we navigate this difficult period for our customers and the markets. We have demonstrated the ability to access the bond and commercial paper markets in recent weeks. Our strong financial position gives us confidence to continue to invest, while also supporting all of our stakeholders. I'll turn it back over to Hans to provide a look at our 2020 priorities and then we'll get to your questions.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. Let me just round this off with our priorities going into this year and in the future. First of all, I feel that we're very well positioned to execute both in the near term and the long-term to create more value for all our stakeholders. We have the Verizon 2.0 transformation, which is a new leadership, a new network technology, a new go-to-market, and we are delivering on that. And I feel that we have good results already right now, but more to come. I think we also have a very good strategy around the COVID-19 response that is covering all our stakeholders in a balanced way in order to create long-term value for all of them. The 5G is still very much in the middle the center of our strategy. And as you heard me saying before we're in the middle of the execution and we're not halting that. We're keeping it up all the time and the team is doing great work there. And we see opportunity with 5G going forward both with building all the cities, the 5G mobile edge compute as well as making this nationwide 5G still this year. Matt talked about our discipline and the financials and our capital position and our capital allocation, I feel good about that. We have done tremendous not in the last 12 months, but also the last three months in order to put us in a good situation to continue to meet all the demands in our capital allocation all the way from our business to our shareholders to our debt holders. And ultimately I think the strong brand that we have has been reinforced in times like that both by the talent we have but also by the response to our business practices and the way we're dealing with our society. So, all-in-all, I feel good about our strategy. I think that we are in the middle of execution of it. We need to have a multipronged strategy where we're managing the crisis at the same time, but that doesn't mean we should not execute on our strategy. So, by that, I hand it back to you Brady.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. A question about your updated EPS guidance. As you noted during your presentation, certain activity in the business has declined significantly. I would assume that there's a degree of cost savings associated with that. You also highlighted some areas where you're seeing some pressures. You highlighted roaming revenues as an example. So, I was hoping you can maybe just give us a little more insight into the puts and takes that caused you to see a slightly lower outlook for earnings over the course of the year. And then just point of clarification you said that this revised outlook reflects headwinds you expect to see in the second quarter. I'm curious whether you're saying that the variance in earnings that you expect to report this year will primarily be contained to the second quarter or if you're saying that those headwinds for the remainder of the year collectively resulting in a change? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Hey Brett thanks for the question, and good morning everyone. So, as you look at the guidance and we went through some of it in the prepared remarks. But as you look at the items that are in there, when I think about the revenue side for the second quarter, really break it up into two major buckets. You think about the actions that we've taken and the actions -- or the impacts of changes in customer behavior. So, as I start off and think about the actions we've taken, it starts with, obviously, the Keep Americans Connected Pledge for that 60-day period. The vast majority of that is in the second quarter and so we'll see more impact in Q2 than we saw in Q1. Additionally, as we mentioned, we've given customers an extra 15 gigabits of data, and whether that be on metered plans or on hotspots for those customers who are on unlimited plans. So, that's going to have a significant impact on the overage fees that we would normally collect. Earlier this week, we announced that we would be extending that 15 gigabit from the end of April through the end of May. On the customer behavior side, one of the obvious ones is obviously international roaming. I think it's fair to say you can put a pretty low number in your model for international roaming revenue for the second quarter. But also in there as we think around especially in the SMB side of the business, we would expect to see those customers suspending some of the lines on their accounts over this time period, and that will have an impact on revenue too. So, when we add all those things up, we see that those should impact the year-over-year service revenue growth in kind of the 3% to 5% range in Q2. Some of those things will obviously extend beyond Q2. Some of the things may not extend beyond Q2. Obviously, we control how much we extend the actions. The customer behavior will obviously be impacted by more of the macro environment, so we'll see how that plays out into the second half of the year. So, you have that there on the service revenue side. As you think about other parts of revenue, obviously equipment revenue will be down. But also within media, as I mentioned, we're seeing a significant reduction. We were down 4% for the first quarter but 10% in March. So, basically all of the year-over-year decline in the first quarter was contained in the COVID period. And then, as we've gone into the second quarter here, we're seeing those reductions increase. So, a lot of the industry forecast is 20% to 30% reduction of $1.7 billion of quarterly revenue, that's obviously a material number too. So, we have some benefits come through on the expense side, but obviously those revenue impacts are going to impact the overall profitability in the quarter and you see that reflected in our guide. In terms of the back half of the year, really too soon to tell. I mean there's a lot of things that play out here over the course of the next 90 days. We'll have a much better sense of what the back half of the year looks like. And then obviously, we'll update our view on that when we get to the next call. But we're optimistic. What we -- that's what we don't know. What we do know is we come into this situation in a position of strength. We've had good performance in the business over a number of quarters now. We come in with products and services that are obviously very important to customers, and we come in with a balance sheet that we've worked on significantly over the past few years. It gives us a little bit of a shock absorber if you will, so that we can keep operating our business and position ourselves to come out on the other end of this situation for a position of strength. So, that's how we're kind of seeing the second quarter and as we look forward to the rest of the year here Brett.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Brett. Hey Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Maybe just as a follow-up to Brett's question on that 300 to 500 basis points. Matt can you give us any more color in terms of maybe the sub-impact and the ARPU impact that you expect to see from all these different pieces? I mean, you gave some great detail on what's going on in April here, but maybe a sense for what the sort of total gross add impact that you expect to see? And then, maybe on the ARPU side, how big these components are that are being affected? And how that could potentially play out in that sort of 1% to 3% service revenue decline you're expecting? And then maybe a new topic on the Fios side. When did you guys start the new policy of not entering consumers' homes? And I saw -- I think you -- it shows here that Internet net adds are definitely slowing, but do you expect that to go negative? And then, what do you see for video trends as we look out into the second quarter? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, John. So following up on the service revenue. When you think about the ARPU, you've got the base billing and then you've got the additional things that go in there whether that be international roaming, whether it be overages, whether it be late fees or whatnot. So we feel really good about the core billings within the business. We're seeing customers use our products and services, obviously on a -- in a very strong fashion and I should expect to see that continue. But where we will see some pressure is around the edges with those other parts of what we bill, whether as I say it be roaming overages or whatnot. So the vast majority of that 3% to 5% comes from those items that we bill that are in the service revenue line. And then on top of that, you'll have the impact of suspends on the SMB side. We'll see how much that plays in. So overall, most of the -- we will see an impact in ARPU there as we go through the quarter. But subs are looking in a great position as we mentioned the churn is at a low level. You're looking at about a 0.5 type of range right now in Consumer. Obviously, that's very low compared to where it has been. And I think it reflects the fact as you go into a time like this consumers obviously value the quality of their network connection with all the increased activity we've seen across it. So all in all, that's where you'll see the majority of the impacts in service revenue as we go into the second quarter here. And I'll turn it over to Hans and provide some comments around what we're doing with Fios and the engineers going into consumers' homes and whatnot.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. And John, let me say one thing that we have been balancing all the time is of course safe and -- safety and health for our employees. And that's why we were very early on to actually close down almost 70% of our stores and go to new sort of visiting hours and all of that. The same we have done with our engineers in the field very important for us to see that they are safe and healthy. And in the beginning here, we were very restricted on visited on homes. But we've also seen a lot of innovation. And the last couple of weeks here, we have actually innovated so we can start installing Fios without going into the homes with both what we call the Fios in the box, which is where the consumer or the customer is installing themselves. As well as we also have a virtual agent right now where the customer can be guided how to do the installation. That innovation we have been able to do in two, three weeks and now we start ramping that up. And I'm confident that over time, we almost can be back on a normal levels of installation, but with the safe and healthy of our employees and as well for our customers. And I think that again, just coming back to the importance on balancing, in a crisis like this you need to balance all the different stakeholders and see that you really have the priorities right. And our priority has been from the beginning the safety and health for our employees. That's very important. Second is of course to see that our networks are staying up because of the importance of our infrastructure in these times. Because we know that the country is needing our network and our technology staying up and having the highest quality as Verizon always has. So we are managing that every day here and I think we're managing it very well. And as said, the innovation is now piling up and we can go back to something that is normal, but in a totally new way of doing it. So I'm grateful for my team.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, John. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks. To clarify one more time on this 3% to 5% in 2Q, can you please confirm that versus your prior expectation for year-over-year growth rather than just year-over-year? And also, can you quantify what the service revenue headwind was in the first quarter versus the regular business growth rate? And then second, Verizon Media revenue sounds like down 20% to 30% in the second quarter. What do the margins look like in this business? We don't really know much about what the sort of cost flexibility is there and whether margins can stay positive or flip to negative when revenue comes down quickly. Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Phil. So as you look at the service revenue and you think about the impacts in there, the 3% to 5% is really is going to be 3% to 5% lower than they otherwise would have been. A reduction in the growth rates on a year-over-year basis is what you'll see there. There was a small impact on service revenue in the first quarter. If you think across both consumer in the 30 to 40 basis points of service revenue growth, so the 1.9% would have had some upside without the impact that we saw at the back end of March. But we're in -- we like where the position of the service revenue trajectory is. As you come into the quarter as you go into 2Q here, the core underlying performance of the wireless business in both consumer and business is very strong. And we expect to see that show up in our service revenues throughout the rest of the year.\nHans Vestberg: Something about the Verizon Media Group, as Matt reported, of course, that we have seen an impact lately on our advertising. We're of course encouraged about the increased activity and the growth of engagement because that's ultimately going to pay off later on. And I think that first of all our Verizon Media team has been extremely innovative with new products and new ways of delivering services the last couple of weeks here in a time of this pandemic. I have to say that I have a lot of confidence in my Verizon Media Group to work with different scenarios given how this pandemic will develop and how it will hit Verizon Media Group. We have seen the last 18 months or I don't know six quarters that our Verizon Media Group has found ways to both reduce direct cost and find new ways to innovate. But all-in-all, we need to understand that of course advertising these days you are restrictive, you're cautious given the pandemic. But again I think that as I said in the beginning, we are working with different scenarios that can happen and we have different levers and activities that we can do given where this is going. That goes for all our different businesses, which of course they are in different form and shape at the moment but it also goes for the whole corporation. And then just adding on what Matt said about our wireless business, I think that one thing that worked in the brand, since we embarked on the unlimited some two years ago, we have constantly built a model, which can actually meet all the different scenarios, all the way from our Mix & Match, or in Visible, Yahoo Mobile the work we're doing with track phone, the network as a service. I think that regardless where it will go, we will have opportunities to actually serve our customers with the plans that they need. And I think that few others can do that in this market as well as we have the best network. So I think we're well-positioned in the world that might be uncertain, but we have all those different type of opportunities to serve our customers.\nMatt Ellis: And just real quick on the cost side there that comes, obviously, the service revenue impact and the media revenue impact. But obviously we're doing things to manage the cost side of the business as we go through this period. And it's really building on the work we've been doing for the last few years now and it's put us in a position where we can take the actions that we need to in this time. We'll see some cost benefits as we go through this. But it also allows us to do the things to support our employees and customers and to keep investing in the business for the long haul even as we're in this unusual time period. So cost controls are very much on our mindset as we go through this time period as well.\nPhil Cusick: If I can just clarify as well on Brett's question, you said that a lot of the impact I think for the EPS cuts in the second quarter. But I think it would make sense that you're guiding for probably weaker earnings through the year. Is that fair?\nMatt Ellis: Most of the impact in the guide is the impact that we discussed in the second quarter. As we look to the second half of the year, obviously, there's a very wide range of potential outcomes there. So we'll see how that plays out. And obviously when we're on this -- the next earning call 90 days from now, we'll have a lot more to say about the second half of the year. But a lot of the commentary we had and a lot of the updates in the guide relates to what we'll see in 2Q. But we will see some of those revenue impacts you think about international roaming for example will stay with us for a longer time period. But we'll wait and talk more about the second half of the year when we have better visibility into it.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Phil. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could, first, just kind of looking at the slide 17 where you give us the COVID environment effect on the mobile business. Could you give us some of that similar color consumer SMB and enterprise on the wireline side? And then second, obviously, last quarter there was a big investment in the business services group in terms of trying to modernize the tech and the go-to-market capabilities. Could you elaborate a little bit on what's been accomplished thus far in that exercise? And what in the current environment your expectations might be for the return on that investment at this stage? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. That's -- let's unpack those. Starting off with the wireline impact on the current environment. In Fios, we talked a little bit about that. We saw good volumes in Internet in the first quarter, but that was largely a reflection of low churn as we came into this. And obviously a lot of appreciation from our customer base on the quality of the Fios Internet product. As you go into the second quarter, you're going to continue to see the benefit on the churn side, but obviously we'll have some impact on the gross adds side from the employee actions that Hans mentioned where we're not allowing employees to really enter customers' homes. What's really good -- what you see from us is say okay, how do we react to this? So Hans talked about the FiOS in a box right. Let's not let this environment completely stop what we're doing. How do we -- yes there's an obstacle in our way. Let's find a way around it. This team is phenomenal on doing that. So, we will have some gross adds here in the quarter that we might not have expected when we first stopped going into customers' homes. As you look across the other parts of wireline, as you get into SMB, and the larger businesses obviously, as we've seen an uptick in usage across the core networks and we've been doing a number of things to help especially our larger enterprise customers adapt very quickly to having their -- a large number of their employees work from home and having to update their systems to be able to handle that change in network traffic and where the work is performed. So, I would expect to see a continuation of that. But it won't massively change the ongoing wireline trends -- revenue trends that we've seen across the business as we think about second quarter here. In terms of the investment in VBG and what you see in the margins in the first quarter there, I think we came in with a decent margin for that group. But as I said on the call back in January, this isn't a one quarter investment in the business. There's a number of things that we need to do to upgrade the capabilities of our Business group, so that we can be that partner of choice for businesses as we enter the fourth industrial revolution. And so there's a lot of good activity going on there. And I'll stick with what I said on the last call that we'll be investing in that for quite a while here. We should start to see the impact -- the benefits on the cost side towards the end of this year. And then, the impacts on the revenue side in '21 and really getting full steam in '22, so a lot to come there. And Hans, I'll let you follow-up on that.\nHans Vestberg: Yes you're absolutely right, Matt. This is -- we are clear on the strategy of the Verizon Business Group. I just want to remind all of you we brought together several different groups on wireline and wireless and this go-to-markets. Tami and the team has very clear strategy of doing the transformation. That has not slowed down. We continue with that because, when coming into this COVID-19, we see even a more importance of Verizon Business Group and then me and Matt talked about, this is one of the areas we see that we have a great opportunity going forward as we build a Verizon Intelligent Edge Network as we come with 5G and the trends in the industry. I mean digitalization all of that which of course has been accentuated in this COVID-19. So, I feel good about what we're doing here. The team is running as fast as they can with this transformation. But as Matt said, this is not the one quarter thing, but we're not holding back on the transformation. And in that transformation, we said we will invest and one investment was of course the BlueJeans, which we have had in our portfolio for a couple of quarters as a distributor. But as this turned out, we felt that it was a good opportunity to actually make the acquisition and we have been testing them. It's a great product. And we stitch that into our go-to-market in the Verizon Business Group. But I also see it as a great opportunity for the 5G. Because ultimately 5G at the edge, we will have a lot of low latency enormous throughput where video and transcoding will be important. So, adding that asset is also important for the future. So, once again we feel good about our strategy in Verizon Business Group and how they have performed. And we have some more work to be done and we're not holding back on that transformation as that will put us in even stronger position when they're done.\nDavid Barden: Thanks guys.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Dave. Hey Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Good morning. Thanks for all the color on the COVID-19. Very helpful. I wonder Matt if you could get into a little more on the bad debt, help us understand where that is across the Consumer versus Business. I'm guessing a lot of it's in SMB. How does that break wireless wireline? And then, Hans, could you talk a little bit about the digital channels. You talked a lot about FiOS in a box. How are you thinking about maybe pushing more of the phone sales and wireless sales through the online channel? Where are you today? And what can you do to increase that percentage? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks Simon. So, on the bad debt as we look at that the vast majority of it is sitting in the Consumer side just because of the relative difference in the size of the businesses between Consumer and SMB. As we did the bad debt reserve this year, we're now operating under the new CECL accounting standards. It requires us to take a more forward look at expected losses. And so really what we did, we took -- we looked at how many customers have availed themselves of the pledge. We used that as a starting point for the reserve. I can tell you as of around mid-April, we have around 800,000 customers who have signed up for the pledge and some of the various other state ordered. The vast majority of those are in mobile and that provided some of the bases. But it's too early to know exactly how the bad debt requirements will play out. We'll monitor that closely here as we go forward. But certainly we're seeing different payment patterns across different parts of our customer base. Actually encouraged by what we're seeing on the consumer side here over the last couple of weeks. And another proof point that as we've talked about in the past as we saw in the financial crisis that consumers continue to put their phone bill high up their list of priorities for payments. And certainly we're monitoring closely on the Business side, especially within SMB, how that's going to play out. Nothing in the payment patterns at this point is overly pessimistic but we're obviously going to stay very close to that and work to keep our relationship with our customers wherever possible. So that hopefully gives you a little background on how we look at the bad debt. And I'll let Hans answer the question on how we see digital channels going forward.\nHans Vestberg: So let me just lay out how we're running the company right now. We're basically running the company in a three-pronged strategy. The first prong is of course, the crisis management, where we have a team that is dealing with all the challenges with pandemic for our employees, for our customers and for the society at large. Secondly, I have the majority of my leadership team, running business as usual. We have our 5G governance early this week where we went through all the deployment, all the 5G mobile edge compute, all the new business cases just running as normal. And then we have a team, which also think about the new normal. What will be the new normal when we come out on this pandemic? And one of the question which is I think, I believe is going to happen we're going to see much more digital sort of omnichannel from our customers and we are ready for it. We have already pivot to it. We're probably going to see another environment \u2013 work environment that we need to think about. We're probably going to also see a different type of product that we need to put forward. So I try to see that we have all these three prongs working at the same time in order for us to come up even stronger from this crisis, as well as managing today and not missing our target put up, as well as managing the crisis at the same time. So I can only confirm I have the same feelings you have. We're going to see much more of digital usage of ordering. But we're also going to see things that we never thought were possible. I mean Telehealth will increase over time. People are now and still they don't need to go to hospital. We're going to see education \u2013 remote education growing because people see that it's actually working. All that's going to be new normal, where we \u2013 our assets are extremely important in that delivery to all our customer groups. So you need to work on all three of them and we are working all three of them to come even stronger out on this crisis.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, thanks, Simon. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. I wonder if I could just ask a slightly longer-term question in the context of the COVID crisis. Your investments in wireless which have largely been \u2013 in 5G I mean, which have largely been on the back of millimeter wave spectrum have almost necessarily been in dense urban gathering places, like stadiums and arenas and airports and what have you, which is obviously where people aren't today. Do you stop and say there may be a real change in social patterns that suggest a different set of investment priorities that are more along the lines of coverage and less around dense urban usage? Or is that likely to be sort of a short-term blip just given how long the planning windows are for network densification? I ask this in the context of a spectrum strategy, where it could well be that mid-band spectrum becomes even more important now given a potential pivot away from those very dense urban gathering places.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. It's still to be seen first of all of what will be the social patterns for the time. I feel pretty confident that dense urban areas will continue to be dense urban areas. At the moment, we still see a lot of usage in dense urban areas. It's just that we see less movement of people because they are staying home. So people live where they live today. So we are not changing the strategy how we execute both on the broader nationwide, as well on our city deployment. And ultimately, we see that as being a very compelling offering going in the future. On the mid-band, as I said before, especially on the C-band, we think that is an attractive spectrum because first of all as you said, it is a good coverage. But also it's a global roaming standard for 5G. And of course, we want to be part of that. And we are encouraged by FCC's plan to conduct a C-band auction in December. And we will always do our normal return on investment between the different densifications, buying spectrum, putting more software and keeping in mind that we want to continue to have the same headrooms in the network as we always have in order to have the best network. So yes it plays in. It's a little bit too early to say that we're going to have a changed total social pattern in the United States. Initially, I don't think so. People live where they live and that's going to continue to be the same.\nCraig Moffett: And can you comment specifically about, the L-band uplink concept and the availability now of Ligado spectrum?\nHans Vestberg: Yes I can, or at least having some views on it. We of course are following what FCC has come out. We still feel that are several challenges with L-band. As -- first of all it's not used, that frequency is not used anywhere in the world. That means that there are no equipment, no handsets and things like that which you need an ecosystem. That's so important. But as with all frequencies and all, the spectrum, we're of course looking into it. And we have done it for seven years. This is nothing new. I think that Ligado has been around for about 10 years. So it's nothing new. So we are continuing -- our engineers are always looking into new development if something can happen. But so far we have seen a little bit more headwind than anything else on that band.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. Thanks, Craig. Hey Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great, two if I may. First off I was wondering, if can you give us the number of customers that have stopped paying their bills I guess specifically their wireless bills, as a result of COVID-19? And I assume that that number was included in your, disconnect? You'd mentioned, I think 800,000 in response to Simon's question. Just trying to understand where that number comes into play? And then secondly as it relates to, free cash flow and the dividend. I was wondering if you can just give us some framework in terms of how to think about the potential dividend payout, expected in 2020? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: You can start, if you unmute.\nMatt Ellis: Sorry about that. Hans it's really helpful. Thanks Colby. So the number of customers who are referred to in the prior question was the number of customers who have told us their ability to pay their bills has been impacted by COVID. That's not to say they've been disconnected. They haven't been disconnected. Just like every other customer that doesn't pay completely on time that we work with them. And the vast majority of those we end up getting them back on a payment schedule and they continue their relationship with us. So, we haven't -- and even those who have -- provided themselves of that, doesn't necessarily mean that they have completely stopped paying. They are just indicating to us that they've seen an impact. But when you look at the total impact we've seen, when I compare it to some of the numbers reported by -- whether it be on the mortgage side or the auto loan side we're seeing a better overall performance in terms of the customer payment profile than what we've seen. And that's consistent with what we saw in the financial crisis in 2008 as well. I mean we have a very important product for our customers and they value it. They value the connection they get from the best network and we see those, show up in the payment. So Hans, I think, you wanted to make some comments around the second question on free cash flow?\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. First of all, I think we talked about where we stand on the balance sheet and the great work the team has done with the balance sheet not only the last couple of years but also in the first quarter. And we feel that we're in a very good position with our balance sheet. And that can be seen that we both increased our CapEx this quarter as well as made the acquisition of BlueJeans. We have our capital allocation priorities very clear for us. Number one is the business. Number two is the shareholders. Three is the debt reduction and number four is the buyback. And we feel that we're in a really good situation to continue to put our Board in the right position to serve our shareholders with dividend. But as we said on the Investor Day, when it comes to buybacks that's probably unlikely happening this year given the situation, but all other priorities we are definitely in a very good position to serve at this moment.\nColby Synesael: Okay, thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Colby. Hey Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups, first you gave a lot of detail on the potential impacts on revenue. I was curious if you could provide some additional details to quantify or help to approximate the variability of wireless expenses to the variability of gross adds or overall device sales? And then secondly, does the temporary use of other license holder's spectrum, increase Verizon's interest to rent or lease spectrum on a commercial basis in the future? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks Mike. So I'll answer the first question on the variability of expenses. So obviously as we have lower volumes, you see lower handset costs and that obviously close through immediately. But a lot of the other expenses as you think about it in the immediate term don't necessarily move. Even promo costs for example as we've talked about before, we now under, 606 amortize a lot of the promo expense over the expected life. So you see that come across over 2.5 years typically versus an immediate cost. So if we get a reduction, a benefit of lower promo expenses also gets amortized over that time period in the income statement. So you're going to see that flow through there. Other areas where you see an impact from volumes, where we have lower volumes, especially in store we see lower accessory sales and those typically have a good margin on. And so, there are impacts there as well from seeing lower sales, not just in terms of lower expenses, but there is an impact on the revenue line that can come with that. So net-net, you do see a reduction in cost with lower volumes, but there's some other things that go in the other direction and some of the benefits and expense are going to get realized over time, rather than immediately in there. So, hopefully, that helps you think around how that shows up in the income statement. Hans, I'll let you add -- follow up on the question on the spectrum that we took advantage of.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. First of all, we want to thank the FCC for so rapidly come out and lending out spectrum to all the players in the market, because nobody knew how the usage will be on the network. As you can see, when we exclude the temporary spectrum that we lent from FCC, we have the same headroom and the network has performed very well. On top of that, we are, of course, adding capacity right now and also put in the DSS, the dynamic spectrum sharing, which I can report that the tests are going very well. We're on plan for putting that opportunity in the hands of Tami and Ronan to decide when they want to turn on nationwide. So, I think, we have a very good spectrum strategy and with the spectrum we have and we're very happy with it and we're going to continue with that. So, I think, that's where we are right now.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. Thanks Mike. Hey, Brad, we have time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Hans, I just wanted to follow-up on your DSS comments. So if I go back to my notes from mid-February following the Analyst Day, it seemed like you were very firm in saying DSS by year-end -- with 5G by year-end with DSS. Is there any change to that? And then, just on the infrastructure behind it, you also talked about -- or Kyle talked about five times the amount of small cells for 5G this year. Has any of the shifts, given the changes in social patterns, shifted back the macro there? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Jennifer. First of all, we feel good about the dynamic spectrum sharing. We are continue to do the test and deploying equipment and the hardware in the field that is needed for doing that. I'm certain that Kyle and his team will put it in the hands of Ronan and Tami and decide when they turn it on in the second half. That's where we are today. So we're not -- have any supply issues to doing that or supply chain issues. The same go for the five times more -- 5G ready base station this year. We continue to just accelerate. And Kyle actually said publicly that we were ahead of the plan when we ended March. I can say today, we're still on plan on that 5x. We have no supply chain issues. We have, of course, complications with some municipalities, but our team is all around that and working with municipalities, finding new way, digital approval, things that we never thought were -- digital permitting processes, et cetera, which we never thought were possible. So, all-in-all, we are not giving up on those targets. And so far it looks really good. And that's how a company should execute in times like this, managing the crisis, seeing that it will be a new and rethink how the new normal will look like. And that's what my team is doing every day right now and we are very focused on doing that. And the good thing is that, we feel good about our strategy where it stands.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. And thanks Jennifer and Hans and team. And everybody, make sure you stay safe and be well. And with that, we'll conclude the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and most welcome to this earnings call. This is an earnings call that is very different from all previous ones that I have done. I've been in crisis -- in the telecom crisis in 2000, bank crisis in 2008 and 2009. This is something totally different. It's a health crisis with a pandemic that impacts each and every one of us wherever you are in this world. I'm proud of the team of Verizon, how we have been backing up in this crisis, and how we work together. We decided very early on to split our team in our crisis management team, and the leadership team continued to drive our business forward. In the middle of February, we made that split in order to see that we're actually attending all the things that's happening in a company the size of Verizon. Our COVID-19 response has been based on how we manage our four stakeholders. We have taken decisive action, but they're all balanced and thinking about the long-term and the positive impact for all our stakeholders. Let me quickly go over what we have done in different areas of stakeholders. On the employee side, the majority of all our employees are working from home. We moved quickly to a work-from-home environment. Today, we have high productivity in that setup. We have also retrained some 20,000 of our own employees to work with new tasks and work from home, and some additional 1,000 of third parties that is part of our delivery. But we also need to acknowledge we have a lot of our employees in frontline, serving customers, keeping up the networks at the same time as keeping some of our stores open. We have roughly 30% of our stores open, of course, with limited opening times and also only by appointment. But they are playing a vital role to keep up the most important infrastructure in this country right now besides hospitals and first responders, and I'm happy to report the team is doing a great job. And talking about our customers, we have been attending all our customers with new demands during this crisis. At the same time, we are also part of the pledge of Keep Americans Connected, which means that we are waiving late fees or overages for small and medium businesses and the residential customers that have been impacted by the coronavirus. Our network has performed well. I will come back to that a little bit later. When it comes to our work in the society, helping communities, that's also extremely important right now. Large corporations need to take the responsibility. We have done some of it like the PayItForward, which is our concert side, sometimes three times a week which is gathering concerts or celebrities, bringing in people actually adding to and helping small and medium businesses. We call it PayItForwardLIVE. But also work with WHO and other organization that needs help and ultimately supporting the most vulnerable in our society. Finally, on the education side that we always have been focused on, we're not only supporting the schools that had already had their support for, but we're also adding together New York Times offering all the content from New York Times to all the high school students across the country. So, we're proud what we're doing in that area. And finally on the financials, we have also worked quite a lot with what we're doing in our cost side. We're taking already cost measurements in the first quarter, everything from third-party spending, seeing of course that we're traveling less but we're doing this prudently as usual. On top of that, we increased the CapEx guidance in the quarter because we felt that it was a good time for us to continue to see that we have robust networks as we went into a moment in time we don't really know how the network would be used. At the same time, of course sending a message that we think is a good return on investment on that incremental CapEx. At the same time, I think, Matt and his team have done a great job of seeing that our balance sheet is in the best shape, added liquidity in the middle of the quarter through very cost-effective bond costs that we had. And we are also working with scenario planning. Nobody really knows how this is going to end, but we have several scenarios and actions that we're working with as a leadership team. Let me talk about the network a little bit, and we have been reporting every week the development of our network since the outbreak of the pandemic. And you are seeing some staggering numbers like over 200% up on gaming, 10 times up on collaboration tools, 40% up on video. 800 million calls a day, which is twice the amount of what we have on Mother's Day which is the biggest day a year. All that we have been managing very well with the network. We have built a robust network and we can deliver high quality. If we then look now week-to-week, you can see on the slide that we have much less of changes. We feel that we have settled in on the type of usage of the network and where it's used. So it's very small variation. I just want to point out the mobile handoffs, which is basically how our customers are moving between different cells down 35% since the outbreak of the COVID-19. And in certain places like New York City it's over 50% reductions on mobile handoff. So how our network hold up then when it comes to all those changes? This is how we show during the Investor Day the -- how our capacity versus the busy hours in the wireless network. As you can see we continue to keep the same headroom in the network when we come into the COVID-19. And the main reason is that, first of all, we were prepared. We have added capacity. But also the network is using different time frames and with different applications. And this exclude any use of the AWS-3 temporary spectrum that SEC so greatly lended to us in the beginning of this crisis as an insurance if usage would go somewhere we wouldn't know. But however, I can report that our technicians and our operations team has done a fantastic job and the network is keeping up very well with the changes and the enormous usage of the network. Let me finish up before I hand over to Matt and talking about the progress towards our 2020 commitment. They are intact. We work to see that we can both handle this crisis, which is unprecedented, but we also continue to execute on our strategy. When it comes to strengthen our core business and grow our core business of course we right now have more digital sales than we had before which is of course very encouraging. But we also strengthened our core business by adding a very good and nice piece of millimeter wave spectrum that gives us very good holdings for four to five strategy. When it comes to leverage our assets and we're growing in the future our 5G plans and our fiber plans the build out of that are on plan. We were also a little bit ahead of plan when we ended the first quarter. And can I report still today we are on plan with the 5G and fiber. Of course, our challenge is out there when it comes to COVID-19 and so on. But our team are finding new ways and innovative ways to actually do the deployment. There are ways of dealing with approvals from the municipalities set by new ways. And we have great collaborations from many of the municipalities to do it. There might be problems going forward but I am also confident that my team are very innovative in the field and see that we continue to drive hard on this. We also added an acquisition just recently the BlueJeans acquisition, adding to what Matt and I said in the fourth quarter talking about the investment we want to do in our Verizon Business Group where we see great opportunity and, of course, then accentuated in this COVID-19 where we now add the BlueJeans capabilities both to our existing distribution, but also for the future of 5G where we think there are video capabilities that's going to be extremely important. On the financial discipline we continue to drive that. Matt is leading that work both preplanning and what we're doing. And finally about our purpose-driven company, which is so important this time to see that you have all your employees with you. We are doing a lot of impact in the society. We have virtual volunteering right now where a lot of our employees can actually contribute to the society in these tough times. And finally, we also actually communicate with our employees basically every day on a live webcast in order to see that everyone knows what we're doing and where we're going in times of uncertainty. Quickly on the first quarter, Matt will cover it much better. I'm proud of the team delivering strong growth in wireless service revenue, but also the 5% growth on our adjusted earnings, which includes impact of COVID-19 and then a strong cash flow up 26% year-over-year. The segments all had their challenges, but also their strength in this quarter. Mainly, the challenges come from COVID-19. Finally on the guidance, we decided to continue to do certain guidance even there are certain un-clarities in the market and of the future. We decided that revenue we will not guide on the revenue, because the hardware is so hard to predict at this moment. But we actually are guiding on EPS and continue with all other items as well. And Matt will go through that in detail, but always with the understanding that we don't have all the knowledge what will going to happen. We may need to make assumptions about it. By that, I hand it over to Matt. Thank you, Matt. Let me just round this off with our priorities going into this year and in the future. First of all, I feel that we're very well positioned to execute both in the near term and the long-term to create more value for all our stakeholders. We have the Verizon 2.0 transformation, which is a new leadership, a new network technology, a new go-to-market, and we are delivering on that. And I feel that we have good results already right now, but more to come. I think we also have a very good strategy around the COVID-19 response that is covering all our stakeholders in a balanced way in order to create long-term value for all of them. The 5G is still very much in the middle the center of our strategy. And as you heard me saying before we're in the middle of the execution and we're not halting that. We're keeping it up all the time and the team is doing great work there. And we see opportunity with 5G going forward both with building all the cities, the 5G mobile edge compute as well as making this nationwide 5G still this year. Matt talked about our discipline and the financials and our capital position and our capital allocation, I feel good about that. We have done tremendous not in the last 12 months, but also the last three months in order to put us in a good situation to continue to meet all the demands in our capital allocation all the way from our business to our shareholders to our debt holders. And ultimately I think the strong brand that we have has been reinforced in times like that both by the talent we have but also by the response to our business practices and the way we're dealing with our society. So, all-in-all, I feel good about our strategy. I think that we are in the middle of execution of it. We need to have a multipronged strategy where we're managing the crisis at the same time, but that doesn't mean we should not execute on our strategy. So, by that, I hand it back to you Brady. Thank you, Matt. And John, let me say one thing that we have been balancing all the time is of course safe and -- safety and health for our employees. And that's why we were very early on to actually close down almost 70% of our stores and go to new sort of visiting hours and all of that. The same we have done with our engineers in the field very important for us to see that they are safe and healthy. And in the beginning here, we were very restricted on visited on homes. But we've also seen a lot of innovation. And the last couple of weeks here, we have actually innovated so we can start installing Fios without going into the homes with both what we call the Fios in the box, which is where the consumer or the customer is installing themselves. As well as we also have a virtual agent right now where the customer can be guided how to do the installation. That innovation we have been able to do in two, three weeks and now we start ramping that up. And I'm confident that over time, we almost can be back on a normal levels of installation, but with the safe and healthy of our employees and as well for our customers. And I think that again, just coming back to the importance on balancing, in a crisis like this you need to balance all the different stakeholders and see that you really have the priorities right. And our priority has been from the beginning the safety and health for our employees. That's very important. Second is of course to see that our networks are staying up because of the importance of our infrastructure in these times. Because we know that the country is needing our network and our technology staying up and having the highest quality as Verizon always has. So we are managing that every day here and I think we're managing it very well. And as said, the innovation is now piling up and we can go back to something that is normal, but in a totally new way of doing it. So I'm grateful for my team. Something about the Verizon Media Group, as Matt reported, of course, that we have seen an impact lately on our advertising. We're of course encouraged about the increased activity and the growth of engagement because that's ultimately going to pay off later on. And I think that first of all our Verizon Media team has been extremely innovative with new products and new ways of delivering services the last couple of weeks here in a time of this pandemic. I have to say that I have a lot of confidence in my Verizon Media Group to work with different scenarios given how this pandemic will develop and how it will hit Verizon Media Group. We have seen the last 18 months or I don't know six quarters that our Verizon Media Group has found ways to both reduce direct cost and find new ways to innovate. But all-in-all, we need to understand that of course advertising these days you are restrictive, you're cautious given the pandemic. But again I think that as I said in the beginning, we are working with different scenarios that can happen and we have different levers and activities that we can do given where this is going. That goes for all our different businesses, which of course they are in different form and shape at the moment but it also goes for the whole corporation. And then just adding on what Matt said about our wireless business, I think that one thing that worked in the brand, since we embarked on the unlimited some two years ago, we have constantly built a model, which can actually meet all the different scenarios, all the way from our Mix & Match, or in Visible, Yahoo Mobile the work we're doing with track phone, the network as a service. I think that regardless where it will go, we will have opportunities to actually serve our customers with the plans that they need. And I think that few others can do that in this market as well as we have the best network. So I think we're well-positioned in the world that might be uncertain, but we have all those different type of opportunities to serve our customers. Yes you're absolutely right, Matt. This is -- we are clear on the strategy of the Verizon Business Group. I just want to remind all of you we brought together several different groups on wireline and wireless and this go-to-markets. Tami and the team has very clear strategy of doing the transformation. That has not slowed down. We continue with that because, when coming into this COVID-19, we see even a more importance of Verizon Business Group and then me and Matt talked about, this is one of the areas we see that we have a great opportunity going forward as we build a Verizon Intelligent Edge Network as we come with 5G and the trends in the industry. I mean digitalization all of that which of course has been accentuated in this COVID-19. So, I feel good about what we're doing here. The team is running as fast as they can with this transformation. But as Matt said, this is not the one quarter thing, but we're not holding back on the transformation. And in that transformation, we said we will invest and one investment was of course the BlueJeans, which we have had in our portfolio for a couple of quarters as a distributor. But as this turned out, we felt that it was a good opportunity to actually make the acquisition and we have been testing them. It's a great product. And we stitch that into our go-to-market in the Verizon Business Group. But I also see it as a great opportunity for the 5G. Because ultimately 5G at the edge, we will have a lot of low latency enormous throughput where video and transcoding will be important. So, adding that asset is also important for the future. So, once again we feel good about our strategy in Verizon Business Group and how they have performed. And we have some more work to be done and we're not holding back on that transformation as that will put us in even stronger position when they're done. Thanks, Dave. Hey Brad, we're ready for the next question. So let me just lay out how we're running the company right now. We're basically running the company in a three-pronged strategy. The first prong is of course, the crisis management, where we have a team that is dealing with all the challenges with pandemic for our employees, for our customers and for the society at large. Secondly, I have the majority of my leadership team, running business as usual. We have our 5G governance early this week where we went through all the deployment, all the 5G mobile edge compute, all the new business cases just running as normal. And then we have a team, which also think about the new normal. What will be the new normal when we come out on this pandemic? And one of the question which is I think, I believe is going to happen we're going to see much more digital sort of omnichannel from our customers and we are ready for it. We have already pivot to it. We're probably going to see another environment \u2013 work environment that we need to think about. We're probably going to also see a different type of product that we need to put forward. So I try to see that we have all these three prongs working at the same time in order for us to come up even stronger from this crisis, as well as managing today and not missing our target put up, as well as managing the crisis at the same time. So I can only confirm I have the same feelings you have. We're going to see much more of digital usage of ordering. But we're also going to see things that we never thought were possible. I mean Telehealth will increase over time. People are now and still they don't need to go to hospital. We're going to see education \u2013 remote education growing because people see that it's actually working. All that's going to be new normal, where we \u2013 our assets are extremely important in that delivery to all our customer groups. So you need to work on all three of them and we are working all three of them to come even stronger out on this crisis. Yes, thanks, Simon. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question. Thank you, Craig. It's still to be seen first of all of what will be the social patterns for the time. I feel pretty confident that dense urban areas will continue to be dense urban areas. At the moment, we still see a lot of usage in dense urban areas. It's just that we see less movement of people because they are staying home. So people live where they live today. So we are not changing the strategy how we execute both on the broader nationwide, as well on our city deployment. And ultimately, we see that as being a very compelling offering going in the future. On the mid-band, as I said before, especially on the C-band, we think that is an attractive spectrum because first of all as you said, it is a good coverage. But also it's a global roaming standard for 5G. And of course, we want to be part of that. And we are encouraged by FCC's plan to conduct a C-band auction in December. And we will always do our normal return on investment between the different densifications, buying spectrum, putting more software and keeping in mind that we want to continue to have the same headrooms in the network as we always have in order to have the best network. So yes it plays in. It's a little bit too early to say that we're going to have a changed total social pattern in the United States. Initially, I don't think so. People live where they live and that's going to continue to be the same. Yes I can, or at least having some views on it. We of course are following what FCC has come out. We still feel that are several challenges with L-band. As -- first of all it's not used, that frequency is not used anywhere in the world. That means that there are no equipment, no handsets and things like that which you need an ecosystem. That's so important. But as with all frequencies and all, the spectrum, we're of course looking into it. And we have done it for seven years. This is nothing new. I think that Ligado has been around for about 10 years. So it's nothing new. So we are continuing -- our engineers are always looking into new development if something can happen. But so far we have seen a little bit more headwind than anything else on that band. Yeah. Thanks, Craig. Hey Brad, we're ready for the next question. You can start, if you unmute. Yeah. First of all, I think we talked about where we stand on the balance sheet and the great work the team has done with the balance sheet not only the last couple of years but also in the first quarter. And we feel that we're in a very good position with our balance sheet. And that can be seen that we both increased our CapEx this quarter as well as made the acquisition of BlueJeans. We have our capital allocation priorities very clear for us. Number one is the business. Number two is the shareholders. Three is the debt reduction and number four is the buyback. And we feel that we're in a really good situation to continue to put our Board in the right position to serve our shareholders with dividend. But as we said on the Investor Day, when it comes to buybacks that's probably unlikely happening this year given the situation, but all other priorities we are definitely in a very good position to serve at this moment. Thanks, Colby. Hey Brad, we're ready for the next question. Yes. First of all, we want to thank the FCC for so rapidly come out and lending out spectrum to all the players in the market, because nobody knew how the usage will be on the network. As you can see, when we exclude the temporary spectrum that we lent from FCC, we have the same headroom and the network has performed very well. On top of that, we are, of course, adding capacity right now and also put in the DSS, the dynamic spectrum sharing, which I can report that the tests are going very well. We're on plan for putting that opportunity in the hands of Tami and Ronan to decide when they want to turn on nationwide. So, I think, we have a very good spectrum strategy and with the spectrum we have and we're very happy with it and we're going to continue with that. So, I think, that's where we are right now. Yeah. Thanks Mike. Hey, Brad, we have time for one last question, please. Thank you, Jennifer. First of all, we feel good about the dynamic spectrum sharing. We are continue to do the test and deploying equipment and the hardware in the field that is needed for doing that. I'm certain that Kyle and his team will put it in the hands of Ronan and Tami and decide when they turn it on in the second half. That's where we are today. So we're not -- have any supply issues to doing that or supply chain issues. The same go for the five times more -- 5G ready base station this year. We continue to just accelerate. And Kyle actually said publicly that we were ahead of the plan when we ended March. I can say today, we're still on plan on that 5x. We have no supply chain issues. We have, of course, complications with some municipalities, but our team is all around that and working with municipalities, finding new way, digital approval, things that we never thought were -- digital permitting processes, et cetera, which we never thought were possible. So, all-in-all, we are not giving up on those targets. And so far it looks really good. And that's how a company should execute in times like this, managing the crisis, seeing that it will be a new and rethink how the new normal will look like. And that's what my team is doing every day right now and we are very focused on doing that. And the good thing is that, we feel good about our strategy where it stands."

            "name": "Matt Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. As Hans discussed, we are in an unprecedented time. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the various measures taken to address the emergency, we experienced starkly different trends during the first two and half months of the first quarter than we did during the last few weeks. We understand that most of you are more interested in what we are currently seeing in the business, so I'll go through the quarterly results at a high level and spend more time addressing the most recent trends and how they impact our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. We will begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results. In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $31.6 billion, down 1.6%. Growth in wireless service revenue in both the Consumer and Business segments was offset by sharp reductions in equipment revenue. Consolidated wireless equipment revenue was down over 16% in the first quarter driven by the Consumer segment, primarily as a result of the limited in-store customer engagement in March, due to COVID. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 billion, down slightly from last year, including the impact from COVID. Low wireless volumes in Consumer Group drove benefits to margins through decreased promotional spend lower equipment revenue and improved churn. These benefits were more than offset by higher bad debt expense, lower advertising revenues from Verizon Media Group in March and customer actions that resulted in a decrease in wireless fees and non-recurring usage charges. Our incremental bad debt reserve of $228 million was the largest component of these items. The headwinds from the deferral of commission expense that Brady highlighted earlier reduced EBITDA by $172 million, which is an impact of approximately 55 basis points to EBITDA margin in the quarter. We have continued to focus on our Business Excellence program with the goal to realize $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by the end of 2021, and have saved $6.3 billion through the end of the first quarter. The activities of this program over the past two years have put us in a position to be more agile and adaptive in uncertain times like these. Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $1.26, up 5.0% from $1.20 a year ago. This included an estimated net impact from COVID of approximately $0.04, primarily driven by an increase of our bad debt reserve. Let's now turn to our segment results starting with Consumer Group on slide 10. Our Consumer team continues to deliver best-in-class services to our customers, while keeping them connected in their personal and work communities. We are extremely proud of the team's performance particularly our frontline workers' efforts to meet our customers' needs during this very difficult period. Our Consumer segment started the year with typical low seasonal volumes during the first quarter. In March, customer transaction activity slowed significantly, due to shelter-in-place policies, travel restrictions and other measures taken to promote social distancing. Later in the call, I will go into a deeper discussion on the exit rate trends as we serve our customers in this new environment. First quarter phone gross adds were down nearly 13% year-over-year and postpaid phone net losses were just over 300,000 for the quarter. Phone churn performance was solid throughout the quarter at 0.77%, which was down four basis points from a year ago. Consistent with first quarter seasonal volume activity and the impact of COVID our retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low during the quarter and is one of the key contributing factors to the decline in wireless equipment revenue. We expect this trend to continue for as long as social distancing policies and other safety measures to protect our employees and customers continue to limit store traffic. Fios Internet net additions of 59,000 were up sequentially and year-over-year, as work from home in-home schooling and other related measures increased the utility and demand for our high-quality broadband offerings. Fios video net losses accelerated for the quarter, and we expect cord cutting trends to continue. In order to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, while providing critical network services, we have modified our approach over the past few weeks and are not currently entering customer locations except for critical functions. Now, let's move to slide 11 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Our Consumer segment entered 2020 with strong momentum, as we added a significant number of wireless connections towards the end of 2019, which favorably impacted the first quarter. For our Fios consumer products, we launched new Mix & Match pricing early in the quarter, providing price transparency and choice in our broadband and video offerings. We also introduced Yahoo Mobile to expand our wireless offerings across our digital media customer base. We continue to generate strong service revenue and other revenue growth. But this was more than offset by a significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to low volume activity. Consumer segment total revenue was down 1.7% year-over-year. The growth in unlimited plans increase in connections per account and high demand for our broadband services in the quarter drove strong profitability for the segment, offset by an increase in bad debt expense as a result of COVID impacts. Consumer EBITDA margin of 46.4% was up 60 basis points over the prior year and included approximately 80 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Lower equipment revenue had a limited impact on our overall EBITDA performance. Now let's move to slide 12 to review the Business Group results. During a time when connectivity is providing critical support to those impacted by this crisis, our Business team is at the forefront to serve our enterprise, small and medium business, public sector and wholesale customers. We remain an outstanding partner for first responders, healthcare providers and other frontline workers. And as Hans mentioned, we are extremely proud of our team's work to deliver essential services to our customers so they can serve others. Business trends were strong throughout the quarter, and we saw heightened demand for our products and services in March. Businesses need our services now more than ever as we saw strong demand for mobility, Jetpacks, VPN services and high-speed circuit capacity in the first quarter. As you look at the detail on the slide for wireless products, you can see phone gross adds were up 25% from the prior year driven by strength in global enterprise and public sector with offsetting pressure in small and medium business. This contributed to postpaid phone net adds of 239,000 and total postpaid net adds of 475,000. Business segment phone churn of 1.02% in the quarter was flat year-over-year driven by strength in public sector with offsetting pressure in small and medium business. Let's now move to slide 13 to review the business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment in the first quarter were down approximately 0.5% from the prior year. Wireless revenues within enterprise SMB and public sector were up year-over-year driven by strong wireless service revenue growth of 6.9%. This was offset by legacy wireline and wholesale revenue declines. We are encouraged by the business EBITDA performance in the first quarter, which was driven by tight controls around spending and strong wireless performance as we generated solid profitability even with higher than usual volumes and the ongoing transformation investments in the segment for future growth. Now let's move on to slide 14 to discuss Verizon Media Group. During the first quarter, Verizon Media Group's performance was impacted by COVID similar to others in the digital advertising and search business. Total revenue is $1.7 billion, down 4% compared to last year, driven almost entirely by COVID impacts. Prior to COVID, our year-over-year revenue trends were continuing the steady improvement seen in 2019. We are seeing increased levels of customer engagement across our platforms. But advertising rates and search revenue have declined in the current environment. Verizon Media launched a coronavirus hub on Yahoo! News and Yahoo! Finance and COVID-19's newsletter through Yahoo Mail, both of which are driving significant customer engagement as we aim to keep users informed on what is happening in their area and around the globe with trusted content. Let's now move to slide 15 for a quick look at the overall wireless performance. Slide 15 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segment for the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue grew 1.9% over the prior year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and our supplemental earnings release's schedules on our website. Now let's review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on slide 16. Cash flow from operating activities was $8.8 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from the prior year. This year-over-year growth was partially driven by Voluntary Separation Program payments and the voluntary pension contributions in the first quarter of 2019 that did not repeat this year as well as working capital improvements from our operations this quarter. Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $5.3 billion, which is up approximately $1 billion year-over-year. We expect the timing of capital spending to be more front-end loaded than it was last year. Our capital expenditures continue to support capacity for unprecedented traffic growth across our networks while we continue to deploy more fiber and add additional cell sites to support our 5G rollout. As we mentioned earlier in March, we increased our full year 2020 CapEx guidance to $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion in order to facilitate Verizon's network activity and help support the economy during this period of disruption. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.6 billion, which was up 26.2% year-over-year and continues to fund our dividend. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with very low unsecured bond maturities through the end of 2021. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.1 times, up slightly from year-end. Let's move on to slide 17 to take a deeper look at the trends we have seen in the last half of March and into early April. During the month of March as COVID safety measures were implemented with new federal and state recommendations for social distancing, our retail consumer and small business activity diminished significantly. By the middle of March, we saw a dramatic shift in customer behavior as stores closed and other business activity halted across the country. At the same time, we experienced increased demand from our public sector and some large enterprise customers to support frontline crisis responders, new work from home and home schooling arrangements and other demands for critical connectivity services. This slide provides selected metrics from March 15 through April 15 and offers a more in-depth view of the early impacts of the current COVID environment. At this point it is unclear how long these trends will continue. In our Consumer Group we closed nearly 70% of our company-operated retail stores and reduced in-store services throughout the day for social distancing safety measures. As you can see on this slide we experienced a significant drop in customer activity and device volumes during this period. Consumer wireless gross adds declined nearly 50% from the same period in the prior year and upgrades declined over 40%. As expected lower customer switching across the entire industry has led to a significant improvement in phone churn. As part of the industry's effort to help customers we signed the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge in March and will waive any late fees and keep customers connected in the event of nonpayment due to the pandemic for the period of the pledge. We have added 15 gigabits of data to metered consumers and small business plans and also to hotspot usage for unlimited plans. This additional data along with increased in-home WiFi usage has resulted in lower data overage revenue in the quarter. In addition to these customer-focused actions and impacts consumer behavior has changed dramatically over this short time period such as reduced international roaming revenue. In order to keep our employees and customers safe through social distancing, we are generally not performing installations for consumer Fios when work inside the home would be required. Gross adds are currently limited to those that can be performed directly by the customer or with the technician working outside the home. In our Business group, we have broken out the trends for our small and medium business customer group showing the drop-off that we have seen in gross adds and upgrades as a major portion of small businesses have seen a steep reduction in activities and in many cases a full shutdown. In contrast to Consumer we are not seeing the same improvement in churn at this time. For public sector and some global enterprise customers, we have seen an increased demand for remote connectivity solutions as a greater number of people are working and schooling from home. Wireless gross adds for these customers were up 163% over the similar period in the prior year, mostly driven by demand for phones, Jetpacks and other connected devices. Our network superiority and long-standing relationship with enterprises first responders and other workers in the fronts has given us the ability to support their connectivity needs across the country when they need Verizon most. In addition to the increase in gross adds activity, we have seen an improvement in retention for our enterprise and public sector customers with phone churn improving by 35 basis points during this period. We are working with all of our customers during this time to ensure they stay connected even if they're experiencing financial hardship as a result of COVID. We believe that our enterprise, public sector and wholesale customers will be relatively less impacted than our SMB customers initially, but we may see increased long-term risk from the crisis. Wireless service revenues in our Business Group are being impacted by reductions in overage fees, a reduction in international roaming and an increase in suspension of lines. Across Consumer and Business, we believe total wireless service revenue growth to be 3 to 5 percentage points lower than originally expected in the second quarter as a result of the reduction in fees and usage-based revenues. Additionally, bad debt expense increased as a result of our changing expectations around customer payments during this time. In the first quarter, we increased our bad debt reserve by $228 million based on the expected number of customers who will avail themselves of payment relief under the Keep Americans Connected Pledge. We will continue to monitor Consumer and Business payment behavior and we'll work with our customers to help them stay connected despite difficult circumstances. As a result it is possible that additional bad debt reserves may be required in the second quarter. In Verizon Media, we are experiencing a decline in advertising and search revenue as advertisers pause, hold back or cancel campaigns during this time and users are searching for fewer commercial terms providing us with less opportunity for monetization. As a result, advertising revenues declined by nearly 10% in the month of March with COVID mostly impact in the second half of the month and that rate of decline has increased in April. A number of industry forecasts expect a 20% to 30% decline in digital media revenues in 2Q and Verizon Media's results are likely to be similar to those experienced in the broader industry. Now let's go to Slide 18 to discuss our guidance and outlook for 2020. Obviously, the environment we find ourselves in today is vastly different than when we originally gave guidance just a few months ago. Given the unprecedented magnitude of the conditions we have all experienced, we are updating our financial guidance for the full year. We remain confident in our strategy our business model and our ability to generate sustainable long-term earnings growth. Our consolidated revenue guidance of low to mid-single-digit percent growth that we announced in January included the expectation that 2020 equipment revenues would not create similar year-over-year headwinds as it has in the past few years. However, device activations have been low since mid-March and we expect that to continue throughout the second quarter with uncertainty around customer behavior for the remainder of the year. The wide range of potential outcomes around equipment revenue led us to determine that it is prudent to withdraw our consolidated revenue guidance at this time. For adjusted EPS, we are revising our original guidance of 2% to 4% growth and are now guiding to a range of negative 2% to positive 2% change from the prior year. Our new estimated range is based on a scenario that assumes significant headwinds prevail throughout the second quarter. We have limited visibility into the second half of the year, which will depend on various potential operating environments. We will continue to assess the impact of COVID on our business, including our bad debt reserve and expect to provide an update on our next earnings call based on how things develop between now and then. Other income statement items for which we provided guidance including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate remain intact as originally guided. As we mentioned earlier, we have maintained our CapEx guidance for the full year that we announced in March. Our supply chain remains strong and we have not seen a material slowdown in the sourcing of necessary equipment from our network and device partners. We are optimistic that the measures government agencies have taken will provide support to citizens, businesses and the frontline responders that have been impacted by this crisis. We remain keenly focused on doing our part to provide best-in-class network performance and customer experience to all of our customers, which will continue to drive long-term operational and financial success, while weathering short-term disruptions. Despite the extreme nature of what the world is experiencing, we believe that Verizon is well suited to remain resilient through this situation. Let's take a look at slide 19 to discuss our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Over the past few years, we have strengthened our balance sheet and the results of those actions have put us in a good position to manage through the impacts of the COVID pandemic. We ended the first quarter with $7 billion of cash on hand. Carrying a higher cash balance during a market crisis is part of our liquidity planning strategy and we executed on that strategy with a $3.5 billion bond offering completed in March. In addition, we started and ended the first quarter with no commercial paper outstanding, but have accessed this market in the second quarter to further enhance our liquidity. During the first quarter and before the market disruption we also completed one of our largest device payment securitizations of $1.6 billion. Having a cash cushion is prudent right now for many reasons, including our expectation that certain customers may have difficulty making timely payments as a result of the crisis. We are closely monitoring these trends, with regard to their impact on our ABS programs. In the second quarter, we had some nonrecurring cash outflows including $2.7 billion of maturities and $1.3 billion of spectrum licenses from Auction 103. Scheduled unsecured bond maturities for the rest of 2020 are zero as a result of our continued liability management strategy that keep near-term maturities low. Additionally, at the end of 2019, given our funded status and prior discretionary contributions, we expect no mandatory contributions to our pension plan until 2026 subject to market conditions. Our pension funded status has been further protected in recent years as we have increased the hedge ratio of our liability to about 50%. This resulted in the funded status of our pension plan only declining from 92% at year-end to 87% at the end of first quarter. Our standby credit facility with our bank group of $9.5 billion provides further assurance of our liquidity. Our balance sheet is strong and our liquidity position has been further strengthened, as we navigate this difficult period for our customers and the markets. We have demonstrated the ability to access the bond and commercial paper markets in recent weeks. Our strong financial position gives us confidence to continue to invest, while also supporting all of our stakeholders. I'll turn it back over to Hans to provide a look at our 2020 priorities and then we'll get to your questions. Hey Brett thanks for the question, and good morning everyone. So, as you look at the guidance and we went through some of it in the prepared remarks. But as you look at the items that are in there, when I think about the revenue side for the second quarter, really break it up into two major buckets. You think about the actions that we've taken and the actions -- or the impacts of changes in customer behavior. So, as I start off and think about the actions we've taken, it starts with, obviously, the Keep Americans Connected Pledge for that 60-day period. The vast majority of that is in the second quarter and so we'll see more impact in Q2 than we saw in Q1. Additionally, as we mentioned, we've given customers an extra 15 gigabits of data, and whether that be on metered plans or on hotspots for those customers who are on unlimited plans. So, that's going to have a significant impact on the overage fees that we would normally collect. Earlier this week, we announced that we would be extending that 15 gigabit from the end of April through the end of May. On the customer behavior side, one of the obvious ones is obviously international roaming. I think it's fair to say you can put a pretty low number in your model for international roaming revenue for the second quarter. But also in there as we think around especially in the SMB side of the business, we would expect to see those customers suspending some of the lines on their accounts over this time period, and that will have an impact on revenue too. So, when we add all those things up, we see that those should impact the year-over-year service revenue growth in kind of the 3% to 5% range in Q2. Some of those things will obviously extend beyond Q2. Some of the things may not extend beyond Q2. Obviously, we control how much we extend the actions. The customer behavior will obviously be impacted by more of the macro environment, so we'll see how that plays out into the second half of the year. So, you have that there on the service revenue side. As you think about other parts of revenue, obviously equipment revenue will be down. But also within media, as I mentioned, we're seeing a significant reduction. We were down 4% for the first quarter but 10% in March. So, basically all of the year-over-year decline in the first quarter was contained in the COVID period. And then, as we've gone into the second quarter here, we're seeing those reductions increase. So, a lot of the industry forecast is 20% to 30% reduction of $1.7 billion of quarterly revenue, that's obviously a material number too. So, we have some benefits come through on the expense side, but obviously those revenue impacts are going to impact the overall profitability in the quarter and you see that reflected in our guide. In terms of the back half of the year, really too soon to tell. I mean there's a lot of things that play out here over the course of the next 90 days. We'll have a much better sense of what the back half of the year looks like. And then obviously, we'll update our view on that when we get to the next call. But we're optimistic. What we -- that's what we don't know. What we do know is we come into this situation in a position of strength. We've had good performance in the business over a number of quarters now. We come in with products and services that are obviously very important to customers, and we come in with a balance sheet that we've worked on significantly over the past few years. It gives us a little bit of a shock absorber if you will, so that we can keep operating our business and position ourselves to come out on the other end of this situation for a position of strength. So, that's how we're kind of seeing the second quarter and as we look forward to the rest of the year here Brett. Yes. Thanks, John. So following up on the service revenue. When you think about the ARPU, you've got the base billing and then you've got the additional things that go in there whether that be international roaming, whether it be overages, whether it be late fees or whatnot. So we feel really good about the core billings within the business. We're seeing customers use our products and services, obviously on a -- in a very strong fashion and I should expect to see that continue. But where we will see some pressure is around the edges with those other parts of what we bill, whether as I say it be roaming overages or whatnot. So the vast majority of that 3% to 5% comes from those items that we bill that are in the service revenue line. And then on top of that, you'll have the impact of suspends on the SMB side. We'll see how much that plays in. So overall, most of the -- we will see an impact in ARPU there as we go through the quarter. But subs are looking in a great position as we mentioned the churn is at a low level. You're looking at about a 0.5 type of range right now in Consumer. Obviously, that's very low compared to where it has been. And I think it reflects the fact as you go into a time like this consumers obviously value the quality of their network connection with all the increased activity we've seen across it. So all in all, that's where you'll see the majority of the impacts in service revenue as we go into the second quarter here. And I'll turn it over to Hans and provide some comments around what we're doing with Fios and the engineers going into consumers' homes and whatnot. Yes. Thanks, Phil. So as you look at the service revenue and you think about the impacts in there, the 3% to 5% is really is going to be 3% to 5% lower than they otherwise would have been. A reduction in the growth rates on a year-over-year basis is what you'll see there. There was a small impact on service revenue in the first quarter. If you think across both consumer in the 30 to 40 basis points of service revenue growth, so the 1.9% would have had some upside without the impact that we saw at the back end of March. But we're in -- we like where the position of the service revenue trajectory is. As you come into the quarter as you go into 2Q here, the core underlying performance of the wireless business in both consumer and business is very strong. And we expect to see that show up in our service revenues throughout the rest of the year. And just real quick on the cost side there that comes, obviously, the service revenue impact and the media revenue impact. But obviously we're doing things to manage the cost side of the business as we go through this period. And it's really building on the work we've been doing for the last few years now and it's put us in a position where we can take the actions that we need to in this time. We'll see some cost benefits as we go through this. But it also allows us to do the things to support our employees and customers and to keep investing in the business for the long haul even as we're in this unusual time period. So cost controls are very much on our mindset as we go through this time period as well. Most of the impact in the guide is the impact that we discussed in the second quarter. As we look to the second half of the year, obviously, there's a very wide range of potential outcomes there. So we'll see how that plays out. And obviously when we're on this -- the next earning call 90 days from now, we'll have a lot more to say about the second half of the year. But a lot of the commentary we had and a lot of the updates in the guide relates to what we'll see in 2Q. But we will see some of those revenue impacts you think about international roaming for example will stay with us for a longer time period. But we'll wait and talk more about the second half of the year when we have better visibility into it. Yeah. Thanks, Dave. That's -- let's unpack those. Starting off with the wireline impact on the current environment. In Fios, we talked a little bit about that. We saw good volumes in Internet in the first quarter, but that was largely a reflection of low churn as we came into this. And obviously a lot of appreciation from our customer base on the quality of the Fios Internet product. As you go into the second quarter, you're going to continue to see the benefit on the churn side, but obviously we'll have some impact on the gross adds side from the employee actions that Hans mentioned where we're not allowing employees to really enter customers' homes. What's really good -- what you see from us is say okay, how do we react to this? So Hans talked about the FiOS in a box right. Let's not let this environment completely stop what we're doing. How do we -- yes there's an obstacle in our way. Let's find a way around it. This team is phenomenal on doing that. So, we will have some gross adds here in the quarter that we might not have expected when we first stopped going into customers' homes. As you look across the other parts of wireline, as you get into SMB, and the larger businesses obviously, as we've seen an uptick in usage across the core networks and we've been doing a number of things to help especially our larger enterprise customers adapt very quickly to having their -- a large number of their employees work from home and having to update their systems to be able to handle that change in network traffic and where the work is performed. So, I would expect to see a continuation of that. But it won't massively change the ongoing wireline trends -- revenue trends that we've seen across the business as we think about second quarter here. In terms of the investment in VBG and what you see in the margins in the first quarter there, I think we came in with a decent margin for that group. But as I said on the call back in January, this isn't a one quarter investment in the business. There's a number of things that we need to do to upgrade the capabilities of our Business group, so that we can be that partner of choice for businesses as we enter the fourth industrial revolution. And so there's a lot of good activity going on there. And I'll stick with what I said on the last call that we'll be investing in that for quite a while here. We should start to see the impact -- the benefits on the cost side towards the end of this year. And then, the impacts on the revenue side in '21 and really getting full steam in '22, so a lot to come there. And Hans, I'll let you follow-up on that. Thanks Simon. So, on the bad debt as we look at that the vast majority of it is sitting in the Consumer side just because of the relative difference in the size of the businesses between Consumer and SMB. As we did the bad debt reserve this year, we're now operating under the new CECL accounting standards. It requires us to take a more forward look at expected losses. And so really what we did, we took -- we looked at how many customers have availed themselves of the pledge. We used that as a starting point for the reserve. I can tell you as of around mid-April, we have around 800,000 customers who have signed up for the pledge and some of the various other state ordered. The vast majority of those are in mobile and that provided some of the bases. But it's too early to know exactly how the bad debt requirements will play out. We'll monitor that closely here as we go forward. But certainly we're seeing different payment patterns across different parts of our customer base. Actually encouraged by what we're seeing on the consumer side here over the last couple of weeks. And another proof point that as we've talked about in the past as we saw in the financial crisis that consumers continue to put their phone bill high up their list of priorities for payments. And certainly we're monitoring closely on the Business side, especially within SMB, how that's going to play out. Nothing in the payment patterns at this point is overly pessimistic but we're obviously going to stay very close to that and work to keep our relationship with our customers wherever possible. So that hopefully gives you a little background on how we look at the bad debt. And I'll let Hans answer the question on how we see digital channels going forward. Sorry about that. Hans it's really helpful. Thanks Colby. So the number of customers who are referred to in the prior question was the number of customers who have told us their ability to pay their bills has been impacted by COVID. That's not to say they've been disconnected. They haven't been disconnected. Just like every other customer that doesn't pay completely on time that we work with them. And the vast majority of those we end up getting them back on a payment schedule and they continue their relationship with us. So, we haven't -- and even those who have -- provided themselves of that, doesn't necessarily mean that they have completely stopped paying. They are just indicating to us that they've seen an impact. But when you look at the total impact we've seen, when I compare it to some of the numbers reported by -- whether it be on the mortgage side or the auto loan side we're seeing a better overall performance in terms of the customer payment profile than what we've seen. And that's consistent with what we saw in the financial crisis in 2008 as well. I mean we have a very important product for our customers and they value it. They value the connection they get from the best network and we see those, show up in the payment. So Hans, I think, you wanted to make some comments around the second question on free cash flow? Thanks Mike. So I'll answer the first question on the variability of expenses. So obviously as we have lower volumes, you see lower handset costs and that obviously close through immediately. But a lot of the other expenses as you think about it in the immediate term don't necessarily move. Even promo costs for example as we've talked about before, we now under, 606 amortize a lot of the promo expense over the expected life. So you see that come across over 2.5 years typically versus an immediate cost. So if we get a reduction, a benefit of lower promo expenses also gets amortized over that time period in the income statement. So you're going to see that flow through there. Other areas where you see an impact from volumes, where we have lower volumes, especially in store we see lower accessory sales and those typically have a good margin on. And so, there are impacts there as well from seeing lower sales, not just in terms of lower expenses, but there is an impact on the revenue line that can come with that. So net-net, you do see a reduction in cost with lower volumes, but there's some other things that go in the other direction and some of the benefits and expense are going to get realized over time, rather than immediately in there. So, hopefully, that helps you think around how that shows up in the income statement. Hans, I'll let you add -- follow up on the question on the spectrum that we took advantage of."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Brady Connor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. As a reminder, we are still in the quiet period for the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum auction so we will not be able to comment on our mid-band spectrum holdings or strategy. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $5.32 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a net pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes a charge of $2.4 billion for the early extinguishment of debt, a $106 million charge related to severance, a $1.2 billion credit pertaining to the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities and a net gain of $131 million primarily related to the disposition of an investment. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the fourth quarter and $5.39 for the full year. We completed the acquisition of TracFone on November 23. The revenue associated with TracFone this year was approximately $700 million higher than the revenue received from TracFone in the fourth quarter of 2020. All of this revenue flows through our Consumer Group. As noted in our press release this morning, beginning in 2022, our adjusted earnings per share will exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. For 2021, such intangible amortization negatively impacted adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.11. And for 2022, we anticipate the impact to be approximately $0.17 to $0.19. Finally, we will be hosting our Annual Investor Day event on March 3 in New York City, where our leadership team will provide further details on our company's exciting plans for this year and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of 2021.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and happy new year to all of you. This past week has been one of the best since I joined Verizon. On January 19, we successfully launched 5G Ultra Wideband on C-band, which will enable more Americans than ever before to experience a transformative speed, reliability and power of our multipurpose network on the go, in their home or for their businesses. Our work throughout 2021 brought us to this moment, and I will spend this call discussing how we got here and how our accomplishment will accelerate our growth. I want to thank our incredible V team for all your hard work and dedication throughout 2021 and for delivering for our customers and our communities. We have never executed so well on so many strategic and operational objectives as we did in 2021. This was a catalyst via Verizon, and I'm very proud of our work. We have a clear and disciplined strategy based on our multipurpose network that creates economies of scale and new business models in an era where broadband is essential to our customers and society. Our results clearly confirm that our strategy is working and that 2021 was a transformative year for Verizon, and it clearly sets us up for a high impact year in 2022. We have now assembled the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of high-quality assets, leveraging our best-in-class technology to extend our network leadership to address more opportunities than anyone else in the market. We're widely being recognized for both what we have accomplished and for the 28th time in a row, J.D. Power ranked Verizon first for network quality. This is our 175th J.D. Power Network Quality Award in 18 years. At the same time, we continue to support our four stakeholders: shareholders, customers, employees and society as a responsible business. Verizon leads the industry in sustainability. We are ranked ahead of our peers, both by the Drucker Institute and JUST 100, and we are confident that our multi-stakeholder strategy will lead to long-term shareholder value. We have a team and expertise to lead the country into a vibrant mobile computing future. Verizon has the best engineers in the world, and they have built a world forward reliable and scalable network. This asset is the foundation and the catalyst for our accelerating growth. So we begin 2022 with a strong portfolio of assets. We're executing our 5G strategy, making great progress on our five vectors of growth and delivering a premier customer experience. This significant momentum sets us up for 2022 and beyond. Let me give an update on the financial and operation metrics. During 2021's first quarter, we set clear targets. As we close out 2021 and enter in 2022, I'm proud to report that we delivered on all of them plus some, and our achievements will only capitalize even greater value creation in 2022. On our January 19 C-band deployment, we covered more than 90 million POPs and millions of homes in more than 1,700 cities, well ahead of plan on making excellent use of the incremental capital spend to augment and accelerate our business opportunities. Today, we cover more than 95 million POPs as the team is progressing also brought more than 15,000 additional 5G Ultra Wideband small cells in service, exceeding our annual goal and nearly doubling our total 5G millimeter wave presence, increasing our fiber footprint to create a state-of-the-art multipurpose network. At our Investor Day last year, we said we would have 5% to 10% traffic in urban areas covered by millimeter wave. Today, we're almost at 10%, it's exceeding our expectation. This confirms our millimeter wave strategy. All this had stage for last week's Verizon Ultra Wideband launch. We're excited and pleased with what we have seen so far from customer reception to network performance. We have grown our network significantly. We finished 2021 with over 20 million households covered for our fixed wireless access solutions and T-band adds millions more homes. For business, our initial C-band expansion will recover more than 1.7 million organizations with Verizon 5G business Internet across 900 cities. We will reach new retail and business clients by offering a breadth of plan options that make our capabilities relevant to their lives. Our new mix and match 4.0 offerings allow customers to pick the 5G plan they want with options for savings on home Internet. For businesses, we offer business unlimited offerings that bring choice and power to the professional market. In addition to our network achievements, we closed on two large strategic transactions in 2021. We sold Verizon Media Group to Apollo Global Management for $5 billion in a transaction that closed in September, retaining minority ownership. And in November, we completed our strategic acquisition of TracFone, positioning Verizon as the number one provider within the value segment. This opportunity enables us to deepen our relationship with new customers while delivering more enhanced services. TracFone is being rapidly integrated into our operation. The acquisition added 20 million customers to our prepaid model and cements Verizon as a leading prepaid vendor at Walmart and Best Buy forming a strong foundation of our retail efforts. We also continue to reach new customers through bundled Internet telephone and television services. Fios Internet adds in 2021 were our best since 2014, and we continue to expand availability of the best-in-class service. Importantly, we strengthened our relationship with our customers adding more connections, including more than 0.5 million new wireless postpaid phone net adds, while maintaining and cultivating our loyal, high-quality relationships. We provided additional value for our customers through our unique partnership strategy with the best brands that are meaningful to people, lives and businesses. This includes content partnership with NFL, Disney, Apple, Discovery and Niantic to name a few. For businesses, we offer mobile edge compute capabilities, something we're first in the world with alongside industry leaders like AWS, Google and Microsoft. Disruptions to consumer and industrial supply chains throughout 2021 and extending into this year have affected all industries and brought digital connectivity to the central focus in the lives of our stakeholders. That said, Verizon has executed effectively under discussion as demonstrated by our successful network expansion and network service launches. Once again, our financial performance demonstrates our strategy is working. Our focus on profitable volume continues to drive wireless service revenue growth of 4.7% in 2021. And in the fourth quarter, 74% of our customers subscribed to an unlimited plan compared to 71% in Q3. Just over one-third of our unlimited subscribers have unlimited premium. This leaves room for continued step-up expansion. Our multipurpose network and flexible plans will also help customers to upgrade handsets and devices. We saw quick adoption of 5G handsets throughout 2021 in anticipation of new services. One-third of our customers' handsets are now 5G-enabled compared to about 25% in the third quarter. We raised our earnings per share and wireless service revenue guidance during the year and deliver on both including 10% EPS growth. We promised also $10 billion in cost savings, and we deliver ahead of schedule. However, we continuously strive to more efficiently manage our business. We generated strong cash flows to support our investments and financial commitment, and we delivered our 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payments while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. As for our focus on ESG, Citizen, Verizon has also delivered on its promises. We took action towards meeting our 2025 goals, including spending to support technology education and adoption to bridge digital divide and contracting for significant renewable energy capacity, positioning the Company to achieve over 50% renewable energy goal by 2025. Matt will highlight on our performance and 2022 guidance in detail. But we will target organic service and other revenue of around 3% as well as EBITDA growth of 2% to 3%. With the right assets in place and a sound strategy to reach consumers and businesses with 5G capabilities and mobile edge computing on our multipurpose network, Verizon has unlimited potential. 2022 will demonstrate this. Now, I will turn the call over to Matt to walk you through our fourth quarter and full year performance in greater detail.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results where we continue to deliver strong financial and operating performance. Before I get into the 2021 results, let me add my own congratulations to the Verizon team for achieving our C-band build targets well ahead of schedule and for the successful commercial launch week. The C-band deployment provides so many opportunities for us. As Hans mentioned, our strategy is working and these results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively to drive new high-quality customers to our platforms while also serving our best-in-class customer base. We do this with the financial discipline that enables us to deliver attractive service revenue growth and profitability as evidenced by another strong earnings performance with healthy cash generation. It starts with our award-winning networks, which enable both our consumer and business organizations to deliver the best products, services and experiences to customers. With the acquisition of TracFone, the deployment of C-band spectrum, new mix and match plans, and the strongest and most innovative team in the industry, 2022 is positioned to be our best year yet. Let's take a look at these results beginning on Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, consolidated total revenue was $34.1 billion, down 1.8% from the prior year. Adjusting for the sale of Verizon Media Group on September 1, consolidated revenue grew 4.8%, strong wireless service revenue growth and wireless equipment revenue were offset by continued declines in legacy wireline products. Total wireless service revenue was up 6.5% for the quarter. The results were driven by a combination of ARPA and volume growth, consistent with our strategy and the contribution from the TracFone acquisition. For the full year, wireless service revenue grew 4.7%, including TracFone, and was in line with the increased guidance we provided at the end of the third quarter when adjusted for the TracFone acquisition. Total Fios revenue was $3.2 billion and grew 5.7% for the fourth quarter, driven by strong customer demand for our high-quality connectivity services. Full year FiOS revenue was approximately $12.7 billion, up 4.6% over the prior year. Service and other revenue grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, while on a reported basis it declined 5.4% from the prior year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $11.8 billion, relatively flat compared to last year as growth in consumer was offset by declines in business and the impact of the Verizon Media Group sale. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $48.4 billion, up 2.8% from the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2% down 50 basis points primarily due to higher equipment revenues. Earlier in the year and ahead of schedule, we achieved our $10 billion business excellent cost savings goal. We continue to drive efficiency in the business while operating with the best cost structure in the industry and expect strong operating leverage as we execute across all of our five vectors of growth. As Brady mentioned, for the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.31, up 8.3% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our business. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $5.39 was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance range and is a 10% increase over 2020 results. Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. The strength of our networks and brand, combined with our effective go-to-market strategy are driving improved competitive performance in the market. We continue to expand our high-quality mobility base with strong performance across consumer and business. At the same time, accelerating fixed wireless sales are complementing strong Fios results, expanding our broadband growth opportunity. For the quarter, we delivered 558,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, an increase over the 279,000 achieved during the same period last year. Postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.81%, roughly in line with the same period last year and better than pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the enduring loyalty of our customer base through ordinary and extraordinary times. Total broadband net adds, which includes consumer and business Fios, DSL and fixed wireless totaled $106,000, up 30,000 from the prior year. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, another strong result. Even with a slight uptick in voluntary churn, we continue to experience exceptionally low Fios Internet churn as customers trust the reliability of our network and the simplicity of our mix and match pricing. Our full year Internet net adds of 360,000 represented the best annual performance in 2014, and we now have 6.9 million Fios Internet customers. Demand for our fixed wireless access services continue to grow even before our C-band deployment. FWA net adds, which include both consumer and business fixed wireless products, totaled 78,000, up from 55,000 last quarter. This brings our total FWA customer base to approximately 223,000 at the end of the year. Now let's turn to our consumer group results. Fourth quarter represented another strong financial performance for consumer, highlighted by our best Fios revenue growth in the 2.0 area, wireless service revenue momentum and healthy profitability. We are clearing the benefits of our focused go-to-market organization. Consumer operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $25.7 billion, up 7.4% year-over-year. Service and other revenue of $19.4 billion was up 5.2% versus the prior year due to strong wireless and Fios revenue growth and a partial quarter contribution from TracFone. As Brady mentioned, the net revenue change from TracFone was approximately $700 million in the quarter, which included incremental service revenue of approximately $500 million year-over-year. For the full year, total Consumer revenue increased 7.6% from a year ago to $95.3 billion, and service and other revenue rose 3.4% to $75.5 billion. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter rose 7.7% to $14.6 billion, reflecting ongoing step-ups into unlimited and premium plans as well as the contribution from TracFone. Postpaid ARPA increased 3.2% from the year ago period driven by a higher premium unlimited mix and growth in products and services, such as content, cloud and device protection plans. For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $56.1 billion, up 4.7% from 2020 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.9 billion for the fourth, quarter up 5.6% from the year-ago period driven primarily by the strong growth in our broadband base. For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.3 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year or more than $400 million, driven by the service revenue growth. Margins were 40.3%, down 20 basis points from last year due to higher equipment revenues associated with increased volumes. For the full year, EBITDA was $41.6 billion up approximately 1.4 billion or 3.4% versus the prior year. Margins were 43.7% down from 45.5% in the prior year as a result of the approximately 28% equipment revenue growth in the year. Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our Consumer operating metrics. Our flexible mix and match plans are at the heart of our go-to-market strategy, supporting continued strong demand for higher tier premium mobility and broadband offerings. Postpaid phone net adds were $336,000 in the quarter. We competed effectively during the holiday season, even as the switcher pool remains soft compared to pre-pandemic levels due to elevated retention promotions in the marketplace. Fourth quarter phone gross adds were up approximately 11% compared to the same period last year, but were approximately 15% lower than the 2019 level. We continue to achieve customer retention with postpaid phone churn of 0.77% for the fourth quarter, relatively flat compared to the same period last year and well below pre-pandemic levels even as trading volumes pick. We maintained the momentum of attracting high-quality customers with approximately 60% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan and over one-third of our base accounts now on a premium unlimited tier. 5G penetration continued to expand with approximately 34% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device at year-end. We expect to drive further 5G Ultra Wideband adoption with the launch last week of our C-band spectrum to more than 90 million POPs, combined with our updated mix and match offerings introduced earlier this month. With the close of the acquisition, TracPhone results are now included in consumer prepaid. We finished the year as the nation's leading value segment provider with approximately 24 million total prepaid customers including the approximately 20 million customers acquired from TracFone. For the quarter, prepaid net customer losses totaled $85,000, which included 52,000 net losses on the TracFone businesses stemming from stronger demand for postpaid plans due to promos in that segment, coupled with handset supply constraint. Now let's move to Slide 10 to review the business group results. Operating revenue for the business segment was $7.8 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3.0% year-over-year. We faced elevated pressures in the quarter in both public sector and wholesale, and we expect these pressures to moderate in 2022. Full year operating revenue was $31.0 billion, up slightly year-over-year driven by strong wireless performance. Wireless service revenue increased 1.5% and wireless equipment revenue was up 9.6% in the fourth quarter. Wireless service revenue was driven by growth in small and medium business and enterprise performance improved for the fourth consecutive quarter and was the highest growth since the start of the pandemic. While this was partially offset by a decline in public sector due to the elevated distance learning activity in the year ago period, our Verizon frontline campaign is resonating with stakeholders, helping drive new customer growth. Wireline trends remain under pressure as we continue to face prior year comps that included pandemic buying. In addition, approximately one-third of our declines came from voice services where we continue to feel the impact of our strategic initiative to exit the low-margin international wholesale voice market. Business segment EBITDA was $1.8 billion, down 7.4% from the same quarter last year. Business segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, reflecting pressure in legacy wireline products and our commitment to invest in new product growth and drive customer demand for our wireless solutions. Full year margins were 24.2%, down 120 basis points from last year. We exited the year with strong momentum in business activity and demand for our wireless products. With the recent launch of our C-band spectrum, we are in an even better position to serve the 5G needs of our business customers throughout 2022. For the quarter, phone gross adds were up approximately 22% year-over-year and 8% from 4Q 2019 levels. The fourth quarter represented the strongest quarterly phone gross add performance for small and medium business and enterprise since launching Verizon 2.0. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, which was up slightly over the prior year. As a result, total postpaid phone net adds were $222,000, our best quarterly performance since the onset of the pandemic. Now let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. Cash generation remains strong for 2021 as we achieved our financial targets and executed on our capital allocation plan. We spent over $45 billion of C-band spectrum and expanded our portfolio with the TracFone acquisition, all while increasing our dividend for the 15th straight year and making progress to maintain a healthy balance sheet. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $39.5 billion for the year, a decline of $2.2 billion. This result primarily reflects strong performance in the business with increased adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion, offset by higher working capital from device payment receivables and slightly higher cash taxes. Capital spending in 2021 totaled $20.3 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while initiating the first phase of C-band deployment covering 90 million POPs. C-band-related CapEx was approximately $2.1 billion in 2021. As a result, free cash flow for the full year was $19.3 billion, down from $23.6 billion in 2020. The highlights of our financing activity in 2021 was efficiently funding our C-band spectrum investment in the first quarter. Since then, we are focused on further optimizing our cash position and debt maturity profile with activity to reduce or extend near-term maturities, while deploying excess cash to retire longer-dated high-coupon bonds. We accomplished this while maintaining ample flexibility to invest in our business such as fund in the recent TracFone acquisition. We are also active with our ABS funding program to finance the increased device payment receivables as consumers upgrade to 5G phones. We exited the year with $133.7 billion of net unsecured debt, a $3.7 billion reduction from the end of the first quarter. Our unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.8 times at year-end, in line with our 2021 Investor Day guidance. Our financing activities over the past two years have reduced our average portfolio borrowing costs by about 1% as compared to 2019, albeit with higher debt levels. Our cash balance at the end of the year was $2.9 billion, down approximately $7.0 billion sequentially, bringing us back to normal levels. Let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss our outlook for 2022. We have great momentum from the strong operating and financial results last year and are well positioned heading into the new year, and that momentum is reflected in our guidance for 2022. We took many strategic actions to position the Company for better growth and our increased guidance disclosures provide greater insight into our financial outlook. At our Investor Day last year, we provided guidance of at least 3% service and other revenue for 2022 and 2023. For 2022, we expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3%. On a reported basis, which includes the net impact of the sale of Verizon Media Group and our ownership of TracFone, service and other revenue growth is expected to range between 1.0% and 1.5%. Similarly, on a reported basis, wireless service revenue growth for 2022 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10%, driven by growth from our tiered unlimited strategy, the impact of the TracFone acquisition, and a ramping fixed wireless access contribution. Excluding the impact of the TracFone acquisition, wireless service revenue is expected to grow at least 3%. We expect total adjusted EBITDA to grow 2% to 3% in 2022, driven by top line growth and ongoing cost discipline. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $5.40 to $5.55. As the waterfall chart shows, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth, including a small positive net contribution from the TracFone and Media transactions to be offset by headwinds from below-the-line items. These items include approximately $0.15 from our C-band investment, including higher depreciation and lower capitalized interest as we put the spectrum into service, $0.07 share dilution as a result of shares issued in the TracFone acquisition, and other noncash impacts such as D&A and pension and OPEB expense. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year, excluding C-band, is expected to be between $16.5 billion and $17.5 billion, a decrease from the $18.2 billion in 2021, and as we have started our progress towards lower capital intensity. C-band capital spend is anticipated to be between $5 billion to $6 billion as we continue to build out the initial markets and begin preparations to deploying Phase II spectrum. For 2022, cash flow from operations are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by increased working capital from device payment receivables as well as higher cash taxes. We are extremely excited for 2022 and expect it to be our biggest year yet. The second wave of 5G is here, and we are leading the way into the future of connectivity. We have the necessary assets and strategy to unlock the full potential of our growth vectors. With that, I will hand it over to Hans to discuss our 2022 strategic priorities.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. The assets are in place to make 2022 Verizon's best year yet. Coming off a catalyst year, we are excited to execute on our 5G growth and deliver the financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day back in March of last year. We have clear priorities for the year. We will continue our legacy of disciplined execution and look forward to delivering against our operation and financial targets that Matt just outlined. We expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3% in 2022. And we also expect to increase EBITDA by 2% to 3%. We commit to strengthen and growing our core business and commercializing our unique assets. By combining our Verizon Ultra Wideband with the new mix and match plans, we can supercharge 5G Ultra Wideband adoption to enhance customer experiences and to increase average revenue per user. At the same time, we will continue to expand our fixed wireless access positioning Verizon as a premier nationwide broadband provider. We believe that Verizon's fixed wire access offering will drive the next leg of broadband growth, increasing our market share and reach. We will innovate in our business of business offerings, bringing mobile edge computing to our enterprise clients and transform the Internet of Things from a vision to reality. You should continue to expect us to sign new clients and provide examples on how the mobile edge compute is addressing the complex needs of our customers. We will benefit from our leading position in the value segment. The integration of TracFone will form the basis of deep and productive relationships that can grow to meet our customers' changing needs throughout life. We will continue to run Verizon as a purpose-driven organization. We will pursue C-band and 5G leadership because these technologies are critical for economic prosperity and driving innovation for all, not just for Verizon. We will continue to serve all of our stakeholders, shareholders, customers, employees and society. And lastly, I also hope to see you all again at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3. With that, I hand it back to Brady.\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\nBrett Feldman: With regards to the guidance you've given for about 3% growth in service and other revenue, very similar to your growth target for just straight up wireless service revenue. Could you give us a little more insight as to what you anticipate to be the principal drivers? In other words, to what extent is this continuing to see people upgrade into higher tier plans, meaning, it's very much an RPA-driven story. And are we getting to a point where you're expecting a more material contribution in some of those emerging growth opportunities, whether it's fixed wireless or mobile edge compute? And then just one more sort of follow-up there on broadband, now that we're starting to see the fixed wireless net adds begin to ramp, should we expect that they're going to be the predominant driver of your aggregate broadband net adds going forward? And could you give us some insight as to where those customers are coming from? In other words, are they primarily Verizon mobile customers taking a bundle? Or are you actually reaching a new demographic? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brett. Let me start and get additional matter. When it comes to the growth in 2022, first of all, I think, we're coming in with a great momentum from 2021, both in our business and in our consumer units. Both of them have done a great job at the end of last year. Topping that, of course, with the C-band launch, which we're very excited about, and we see a very, very good performance with our new offerings, both on the business side and the consumer side with mix and match and all of that. That all great, of course, for us, what we feel is a great momentum coming into this year, and we also have the step-ups and as you heard me and Matt talking even though we are continuing to step up our customers, we even have more to do there. And we have a couple of years of more growth coming from that ARPA expansion. So coming into the year, we feel really good about the momentum we have, but also about opportunity in the market on the wireless market. Matt will come back. But on the broadband piece, just quickly then, we, of course, are very excited over the Fios broadband. What we saw last year was the best year in 2014. We will continue to expand the footprint and because we have such a good performance on it and customers love it. And then on top of that, as I said, fixed wirless access is now coming into a totally different model. We have it on 4G. We have millimeter wave. And then, of course, turning on the C-band earlier this month, we just opened up new opportunities for us. Of course, we want to see fixed-wire access continue to grow for us, and this is a super focus for the team. And you asked where the customer comes. First of all, all the fixed virus customers will have. They use these as the primary broadband solution for them. That's very important because that we see on the usage on them. So you saw back up or secondary line on fixed virus access is the primary broadband usage. And secondly, these customers are coming from basically cable and DSL areas where they are using that. So that's where we take them from. They are new to us as broadband customers, and sometimes they are new. They're not even wireless customers. So that's where we get them from right now. And I think that, that's our sweet spot right now when we're a national broadband provider. So all in all, excited we're getting into '22 with all the assets we have right now and, hey, what is sort of the year with all of that coming together so early in the year for us with C-band.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Brett. So just a couple of follow-ups on the service and other revenues. So certainly, we're excited about all the new opportunities ahead of us, such as fixed wireless, as Hans mentioned, and the other five growth vectors. But as you think about 2022, that organic approximately 3% will largely be driven by the momentum we saw coming out of last year. On the business side, very strong volumes in the second half of the year in SMB and Global Enterprise, it gives us a great platform to build on. I would expect the wireless service revenue growth in VBG to be above the 4.8% they did last year at or above that number. So, we'll see the benefit of the strong second half coming through in VBG there. On the consumer side, as Hans mentioned, we have approximately 30% of our customers with -- on a premium unlimited tier. So we have the opportunity to set more customers up. And with the new plans we announced earlier this month, we give customers an even bigger reasons for stepping up to those premium tiers. So that would be the major drivers of the growth during the year. We get into the second half of the year, start to see fixed wireless, especially as that base grows, we'll start to contribute there, but really built on the great momentum we have, coupled with our activities over the past few weeks gives us a lot of excitement as we think about '22.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Maybe first follow-up on your subscriber momentum comment on. It seems like the industry in the fourth quarter slowed from -- seasonally from the pace earlier in the year, and you're typically much lower in the first quarter. Any reason to think that isn't the case this year? And then second, the majority of the C-band deployment looks like it's going to be done this year. And is it fair to assume the remaining $2 billion to $3 billion happens in 2023? I think, Matt, your comment was that CapEx is beginning to come down on sort of an ex-C-band basis. Should we assume that next year might be even below this year's sort of $17 billion?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. On the competitive environment, yes, we saw that in the fourth quarter. And when we are saying that we have the guidance for 2020, we continue to believe it's going to be competitive, but we have great assets. And of course, what is different in the first quarter this year for many other years is, of course, called 5G Ultra Wideband and their C-band. That's a big difference. We are really excited over that announcement. And as you saw, we now cover more than 95 million POPs, and we have great offerings for to our business customers and for our consumers and then topping that fixed piece access and the mobility case. So -- and later on, we can come to talk about mobile edge compute because this also augment our potential in the mobile edge compute. Before I let Matt comment on the CapEx, I just want to say what Matt and I said at the Investor Day last year, we're going to see over the years right now that our capital intensity going down and partly what is what you see in the BAU guidance we do right now. We have done our fiber for a couple of years. We have done the majority of the long hauls, so to say. And we also see that with 5G expansion on C-band, we clearly see over time an offset on the 4G that we can reduce on that. And much of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that is commonality from the data center to the edge, that also has been ongoing for a while. So that's why we are feeling good about the BAU coming down. And then on the C band, you're absolutely right, $10 billion is the amount we decided and we told Kyle and the team to spend the faster you can because we want these assets up and running as soon as possible. And that's what you see the 5% to 6% right now, we do last year. So, that's with a normal calculation that is roughly two left in the in the year to come. But when it comes to future guidance on CapEx, I think we have to wait with that. But clearly, our target is to continue to be very capital efficient all the time here. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. No, I'll just reiterate a couple of those comments. I mean, absolutely, we're sticking with the $10 billion of incremental. Very pleased with the aggressive pace that Kyle and team have been able to adopt there, which means that we see those -- what we did last year, plus five to six is year leaves a fairly small amount to come through in 2023. And after that, the C-band becomes part of our BAU CapEx number as we add capacity to the network. And we -- as Hans mentioned, we've discussed for a while now, the opportunities to see capital intensity come down and we're starting to see those come through, and they will really accelerate really on the back end of '23, but just one additional item in there. On the one fiber build we've been doing at the end of 2021, we reached a point where we had just over 50% of the markets where we have completed the core network build. So there's only success-based network build taking place in those 50% of the market over the course of the next couple of years. We'll completely complete the core build across all on fiber market. So you have that, you have the reduction in LTE spend as 5G starts to replace it in terms of carrying large amounts of capacity. Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, how much of the capacity millimeter wave has really started to pick up as well. And you can see there's a number of reasons why we feel good about capital intensity going forward here on the BAU. So we will be in a great place going forward. As you look at the spend for last year on C-band 2.1, that's obviously on a cash basis on an incurred basis, the activity in November and December, a large part of that will show up as CapEx in the first quarter here when we pay for those items. So, really strong momentum in terms of what the network team was doing last year. The flywheel is running at full speed now on the C-band build, and you see that with the activity this month so far.\nPhilip Cusick: If I can follow up, Hans, on something you mentioned, I was thinking about anyway. You said that C-band becomes available. You have a lot of capacity. And does that change the way you go to market? Verizon hasn't been tight on capacity, but it hasn't been an excess position in a long time. And now you have all the C-band capacity, does that change your desire to go chase market share?\nHans Vestberg: I think this is sort of the full strategy of Verizon coming together. This was we envisioned and some of us was in conference room in New York in 2018 and talking about Verizon intelligent Edge network. I wanted to build that in order to serve a market where capacity and connectivity is needed all across the network for all type of customers. And clearly, the C-band is just adding enormous lot of capacity for us. But don't forget the millimeter wave now. I mean, that strategy is really working for us as well because we take a lot of the high-volume areas with millimeter wave, which unleash out the spectrum. And hey, we haven't even starting to do a carrier aggregation and using part of our spectrum yet coming into the 5G. So, I would say, clearly, we will be more aggressive on it, especially on fixed wires access because we feel so good about the capacity management and we have the best engineers in the industry. They have never failed the strategies that were put up. So, I feel really good about our capacity. We can go wherever we want. We have Tami and Manon, the two CEOs of our units, going hard on to all the products we have in all angles of the network. So yes, I think we feel really good about our capacities right now and what the team is doing, it's just amazing.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Continuing on the C-band, first of all, I guess, for Hans, is it safe to say we've got the issues with the FAA behind us? And is there any sort of visibility on getting that the affected spectrum up and running and into production. And I guess a follow-on to that, has that had any impact on your business thus far in the year? And then I guess following up on Phil's question, I mean, with the additional C-band capacity, should we expect sort of a more immediate change in trends, either on the mobile or fixed side? And I guess from an incremental standpoint, that you really see a bigger change on the fixed side. How do you expect those net adds to ramp? You saw a nice sequential ramp in fixed wireless net adds going from the third quarter to fourth quarter. Should we expect that to continue as the C-band gets rolled out and your processes to get better and better? And at what point do you get to sort of a normalized run rate of fixed wireless sub growth? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. So first of all, as you heard, our deployment on C-band has been extremely successful, basically deliver a quarter ahead, and the guys has brought up so much site that's just amazing. Then you know also that voluntary, we agreed to not turn on some portion of the sites close to the airports, which is a smaller portion of the totality. I would say this is good progress. Everybody is focused. We have the highest assurance from the White House that this will be resolved very soon. I follow this person and myself. But again, it's a smaller portion of the network. The big thing is doesn't impact our business at the moment, meaning by customers that we can serve. But clearly, we want this to be resolved as soon as possible. So the pressure is on everybody involved to make this fixed. When it comes to fixed wireless access, you're right. I mean we have now, for a couple of years, learned all the way from billing, customer care how to work with fixed virus access. And I think that's a really good way for us to learn going into the second or into '22 when it comes to fixed wireless access. So of course, we have high ambitions internally for fixed wireless access and the team is really well prepared for it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: I was wondering if you could update us on the track phone integration. What are you seeing so far? And what are the opportunities in '22 and beyond, particularly the synergy realization, how does that flow into 2022? And then on the EBITDA, I know, Matt, you mentioned the $10 billion program and you continue to look at productivity, but how are you thinking about inflation presumably in retail stores, et cetera, you're facing some wage inflation. But how are you thinking overall about the ability to pull costs down in this sort of environment?\nHans Vestberg: Okay. I just need to correct myself. It's going so faster. So I said 90 million POPs covered with C-band. We have 95%, as I said, as of today. So I just wanted to correct that. My colleagues here comment that I didn't remember that. It's going fast for us here. On TracFone, when we talked about the integration. As we took this over end of November, the team is doing a great job together. What we are doing from the Verizon side is, of course, bringing our platforms, the network, the products, the experience in IT and all of that, that's what we're bringing. That's where we bring synergies. Then, of course, we're going to have these brands serving their market in their way and seeing that we coexist together with them. So that is really what is bringing out then is some investments in the beginning as we said. But over time, this should be a really good addition to us, and it will be incremental from the beginning. So I'm really excited with TracFone because now we serve the full market and being number one in that segment as well. So it just plays into the overall thinking about our five excise growth, having more places to grow than anybody else in the market, and this is just another vector for us. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So Simon, on your question around inflation, I mean the -- as you mentioned, we successfully completed our cost reduction program by the end of the first quarter, three quarters ahead of target. That really puts us in a great place as you think about inflation because we haven't stopped our work on continuing to get more efficient just because we hit the target but it really got that muscle developed and the teams continue to look at ways to improve our processes, make them more efficient and also improve both the customer and employee experience. So, the teams have continued strong targets in that space as we head into 2022. We all know inflation is out there and certainly we'll see some of that. The good news is that we have a good part of our cost base is tied to longer-term contracts, which means we're not necessarily going to see the full impact of inflation and at the same pace at other industries are seeing. But certainly, it's real. We'll take actions to address that. The guidance that we gave was based off our expectation for -- to see an uptick in inflation this year. And there's a number of levers we have if we can pull if the situation evolves.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nDavid Barden: I wanted to -- first question, I wanted to follow up just quick on Simon's question on TracFone. There's really going to be three phases, right? There's going to be the -- getting the handset cost into the hands of the non-Verizon wholesale customers. And then the second is going to be realizing the margin benefit for migrating those guys onto the network. And then the third piece is going to be kind of grooming those customers from the prepaid base into the postpaid. And so I was wondering if you could kind of agree or disagree with that and kind of give a timetable where we could start to maybe see those tailwinds in margins and postpaid phone nets merge. I think the second question I wanted to ask is, just as the fixed bars access becomes a bigger input to cable thinking about the competitive interaction between telco and cable. And it's not fixed for us acts only, it's fiber investments. They are also kind of putting a pincer movement on them. And given the maturity of the wireless business now, which has had extraordinarily low churn for a long time, now you're getting the kind of into year four. I think we just saw Comcast excite you start to offer $400 retention initiatives. Temperature level in cable versus wireless, in particular, is something of concern. Could you kind of -- maybe Hans give us your thoughts on how that's going to evolve and is it going to evolve in a rational way? Or do we need to be concerned? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I'll start with the second question, and then Matt will walk you through a little bit on TracFone. Yes, on the market, as I said before, I mean, we compete well in a competitive market, and we prepare ourselves for that. And we think our offerings, both on wireless and fixed wireless access, including Fios support, of course, is very strong. Ultimately, we have a different recipe than many others, the best network then we have all our partnerships that nobody else has. And finally, we have a great value proposition to our customer with mix and match where they can pick and shoes. So that's why we feel really good going into this year. And with everything we have been doing in the last couple of years, we know it's working. Our strategy is working here. And clearly, we have also the owners' economics on both wireless and broadband, which is different from anybody else basically, that we actually have this owner because we have built a network from the data center to the edge with commonality, testing type of equipment. And then at the edge, we decide what type of access points we have depending on customer and solutions. And then we give them different applications and bundles with Disney+, whatever or if there are other solutions and I think that's unique for us. We have created that in the last three years, and that's why we sit here right now and feeling, we're going to compete well in this market even though it's competitive.\nMatt Ellis: Hi, Dave, on track. So I think as you walk through the things you described there, certainly, over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, we'll have the ability to bring all of the TracFone base onto the Verizon network and those customers get that step up in performance that you would expect when they come over. So as you recall, roughly two-thirds of the track base was already on the Verizon network. The other one-third will get migrated there. The final piece you mentioned was about once you've migrated them over the ability to step them up to postpaid. And look, those customers that want to step up to postpaid, we'll be in a great position to do so. With, as Hans mentioned, the mix and match structure given the customers' options as they move over to postpaid. But the TracFone acquisition wasn't based on bringing the ability to move more people over to postpaid. We want to have the best prepaid propositions in the marketplace we can complement what was already in place with the owner's economics we have. And so, we are in best position today for customers that want to stay on prepaid. We're going to have the best offer for those that want to move to postpaid, we can do that, too and just very excited about the opportunities that we now have with full ownership of the TracFone brands.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: I want to go back to a topic from earlier in the discussion about what's embedded in the '22 guidance, specifically, what's the expectation for wireless postpaid industry phone growth in '22 and how that compares to '21? And how important is the industry growth in '22 in terms of volume for Verizon to hit the financial objectives that are set? And then just separately, Hans, you made a mention of the Macro mobile edge compute earlier. I'm just curious if there's an update to unpack the financial opportunities and contributions from that arena for Verizon.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, I'll start with the mobile age compute. No, as you have seen, we have a great progress on that. First of all, we have three different business cases on the same infrastructure again where the private mobile edge compute, where the public mobile is compute and we have private 5G network. That's what we're working on right now. And they are a little bit different use cases, of course, of all of them. Some are a little bit more B to B to C and some are really B to B. What we are doing right now is, of course, bringing all that live together with our partners, and we have the three largest web-scale players in the industry working with us on all of these. And suddenly, we start seeing with every announcement that you see in the market, if it's IoT solutions or Metaverse solution, I mean that's what we built the network in normal edge compute. So this year, I'm looking for taking many of our proof-of-concept together with large enterprises and application developers to commercial deals. If you would put it in timing, I would say the fixed wire access is a little bit earlier, as we said all the time. The mobility case is first on 5G, then fixed wireless access, and we talked a lot about that and then mobile edge compute. So, you're going to see more about us gaining and winning a lot of businesses because we are the only one in the market in the mobile age compute. So that's what you're going to see in '22. And then of course, we're going to build up our revenue base going into '23.\nMatt Ellis: Mike, on your first question around the guidance on the revenue. So specifically, is it from a volume standpoint, when I look at the business segment, we saw very strong performance by that group in the second half of the year. We're excited about the momentum they have. We assume that they will continue to perform strongly from Matt's standpoint into 2022. And as you heard earlier, expect them to be at least at the service revenue growth from '21 or above. So that will be driven by continued strength in SMB and Global Enterprise. And then on the consumer side, we assume that the switcher pool will continue to be constrained based on the activity in the marketplace. We will continue to be very strong in terms of customer retention, and we have the opportunity to step customers up. You saw us do that last year. And now we have the additional opportunities that come with that, with the new mix and match plans on C-band. So we have great opportunity there. But as I say, we assume the switch of pool will to show some limitations just because of some of the other activity out there. But even with that, we think we'll have very strong service revenue growth next year. And then, we bring fixed wireless access on top of that, as you think about getting into the back end of the year in subsequent periods. So very excited about the momentum that we see from a revenue standpoint.\nOperator: The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nGreg Williams: It's Greg Williams sitting in for Colby. Two questions, if I may. One is on your 2022 free cash flow. I realize you're not guiding to it, but with EBITDA guiding up 2% to 3% and CapEx, call it, $22.5 billion at the midpoint. We see free cash flow coming in around $20 billion to $21 billion. Obviously, the big bogey here is CapEx, the range could be up to $2 billion including C-band. Can you help us with the proper framework on the free cash flow set up in '22, the puts and takes, the working capital you mentioned working capital drag on 5G phones. What could that drag be? And your pension and how we should think about it? Then the second question just on rising rates. With the expectations of the 10-year eclipsing 2%, how do rising rates change your view on capital allocation and your leverage target? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: So thanks for the questions, Greg. So on the free cash flow for 2022, it starts with the strong cash generation from the business with the EBITDA, and you saw the EBITDA guide plus 2% to 3% driven from growth of the top line. That puts us in a good place. But I do expect we'll see working capital increase next year as we continue to support our customer activity, especially related to the device payment plans. Also as revenues and profitability increases, cash taxes have a nasty habit of increasing as well. So that will, of course, be in the CFFO. And then as you get down to free cash flow, as you mentioned, the CapEx will play in there. We said last year, we'd spend that incremental $10 billion over five years. We're going to see the biggest part of that come through this year. But you're also seeing the rest of the CapEx number being lower year-over-year, that range of $16.5 million to $17.5 million versus $18.2 billion, we've done not just last year but the last two years. So you'll see that come through. And really kind of linking that with your second question, but what you really see is our ability to execute across all parts of the capital allocation model, invest in the business with the -- not just the buying the spectrum, but accelerating the deployment of it, investing in TracFone at the same time, increasing the dividend for the 15th year in a row, continuing to strengthen the balance sheet. We said at the Investor Day last year, our leverage ratio would be about 2.9x at the end of first quarter with all the financing for the spectrum, and we'd be at 2.8x by the end of the year. We hit that target. So you see already coming down while doing that additional spend. So certainly excited about the opportunities that the cash generation of the business give us, and then as you think about rising rates, the team has done a great job of maximizing the debt portfolio. You see that in the interest expense. The majority of our debt is fixed rate. So it would take interest rates being at elevated levels for a long time period for that to flow through into our debt complex. So I think the way that we're managing the debt profile means that the rate environment will not cause us to change how we think about capital allocation model here. And certainly, we're focused on continuing to execute aggressively against all of the pillars of the model.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: I want to return to some of the comments you made about fixed wireless. How should we think about fixed wireless? Is it primarily an opportunity to generate revenue on the 5G platform because it's available? Or is it primarily a play toward convergence and selling a bundle of wireless and home access across not just your wireline footprint but across the whole country. And sort of on that latter point, how do you envision the sale evolving? Do you expect that a converged offering to households is going to become the norm for the industry?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you for the question. First of all, I think what we have designed this network and our go-to-market is optionality for our customers. If the market goes to more convergence, definitely, we will be there. We're going to be nationwide with broadband, and we're going to be nationwide with wireless. If a stand-alone business, we can do that as well because we have the scale right now, all the way from our network, to our capacity, to our IP, to our go-to-market, customer care, all the way we have scale. So we are just playing with the -- where the market is going and giving the optionality. The same goes for our content deals. I mean trying to see that our customers can pick and choose what they want and see if they want it. They can keep it or they can continue with it. So all in all, with our mix and match, our network, everything is set up for optionality of a customer choice. We are the Company that can give customer choice and then we have economies of scale in either of the solution. So if the market go converges, we're going to be there. If it's go separate, we're going to be there, and we're going to have economies both the -- and it will increase our leverage when it comes to profitability because this one network is one way to go to the market for us regardless of.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Supino of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nPeter Supino: Two questions, if I could. Matt, I'd love to hear a bit more about the 2022 guidance for organic service revenue growth of 3% relative to EBITDA growing just a little bit slower. I'm wondering, where the deleverage is in the model for 2022 and when you might expect to see the operating leverage that you mentioned in your prepared remarks? And then Hans, just to follow up on Craig's question about fixed wireless access. You're in the last year using EDLP broadly in Fios and then providing 50% off of fixed wireless access for Verizon premium unlimited sub. And so, it seems like your marketing is behaving in a way that's very focused on driving bundling ratios. I'm wondering if you think that's the right interpretation, and if it is, when might you be more focused on pricing in the broadband business?\nMatt Ellis: Peter, so I'll start off with the -- taking a look at your question around the '22 guidance. So certainly expect wireless service revenue to have another good year starting with the momentum we have coming out of '21, both in business and in consumer. And then we add obviously to that bringing TracFone in and also with the C-band and the new mix and match pricing. So we feel good there. We would expect in the legacy wireline business to see the some of the secular trends that we've been experiencing for a number of years now continue, providing an offset in there and you see the impact of that also as you think about the profitability. But certainly, the 2% to 3% on EBITDA, we think is -- shows that the business continues to grow, continues to increase the cash generation. And as we bring C-band online and execute across all five vectors of growth, we have opportunities to see that margin line expand even further as subsequent years as we go here. So the margin growth, the cash flow growth across the business should continue to be strong not just in '22, but for a number of years out. Hans, do you want to speak to fixed wireless.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, I will answer on the fixed wireless. First of all, I think we have not changed our long-term strategy to be financial discipline when it comes to our customer acquisitions. We are focused on high-quality customers, and we will continue to do so. Our team is extremely methodical when it comes to do these offerings and see the long-term benefit for us and for the customer and what we give them. As I said, right now, in our fixed wire access, we have this bundle to see if that is what the market wants to have. But again, we have optionality with the pricing. We can do it standalone or we can do our premium on wireless. And I think all in all, again, we have ones economics on both of them. So, it should be possibly financially for us. And again, the team is very convinced that we have a really, really good formula here. And I have all the confidence in my consumer team, but don't forget the business team. The business team is doing fixed wireless actuals as well, and they're doing mobility as well, and they have a great opportunity. Again, we use our platforms, the long-term strategy we put in, in order to be using sort of the same type of solutions to our customer base and that we can scale and that's why we can the guidance we do right now for 2022 and feeling good about it.\nOperator: Your final question for today will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.\nTim Horan: Can we talk about the C-band build out a little bit more? On the $10 billion in total spend, will you have basically all your cell sites built with that is done? And will all the spectrum be online? And I guess that's the same question for the 95 million POPs. So you have most of the cell sites built in those locations and maybe what percentage of the spectrum is online? And then on the C-bank, can you give us an idea now that you're operating and what the increase in overall capacity is in latency maybe other measurements would be helpful.\nHans Vestberg: I'll let Matt start. Got so many questions...\nMatt Ellis: So on the C-band build, so look, certainly, we are not complete with coverage from a build standpoint with the initial $10 billion. The $10 billion is incremental. As I said, once we spend the $10 million ongoing C-Band bill becomes part of our BAU CapEx. And you heard our comments earlier around expectation for continued improved capital intensity. But certainly, within the $10 billion is helping us build out significant parts of the first 46 markets, the ones we got access to and turned on last week. And also begin the early build in the other markets that are scheduled be turned on in December of '23. So, we'll get a substantial part of the coverage for C-Band built with the $10 billion, certainly not the whole thing. But then as we do that, traffic moves off of the LTE network to our need to continue to spend on capacity and the LTE network comes down, that's how we'll continue to fund the C-band build going forward as a result of those other efficiencies. So hopefully, that provides a little more detail on the...\nHans Vestberg: No, the only addition I would do is, of course, that when it comes to this initial build, I mean the vast, vast majority is on sites we already have. We have said it before. It's the same grid as the 4G, which is great for us, how we do this. And then we have normal expansions over time, but that's nothing unusually CAU. When it comes to the performance of the C band, this is a perfect sort of cliffhanger. It's a little bit early. Of course, we're excited, but we have Investor Day 3 of March. And I think that if we tune in there, you'll probably get something about the performance on our C-band. But early into it, I'm really pleased what the technology team have done and our partners have done so far, but stay tuned for the 3 of March, and we will talk more about that.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Tim. That's a great way to end. Brad, that's all the time we have today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and happy new year to all of you. This past week has been one of the best since I joined Verizon. On January 19, we successfully launched 5G Ultra Wideband on C-band, which will enable more Americans than ever before to experience a transformative speed, reliability and power of our multipurpose network on the go, in their home or for their businesses. Our work throughout 2021 brought us to this moment, and I will spend this call discussing how we got here and how our accomplishment will accelerate our growth. I want to thank our incredible V team for all your hard work and dedication throughout 2021 and for delivering for our customers and our communities. We have never executed so well on so many strategic and operational objectives as we did in 2021. This was a catalyst via Verizon, and I'm very proud of our work. We have a clear and disciplined strategy based on our multipurpose network that creates economies of scale and new business models in an era where broadband is essential to our customers and society. Our results clearly confirm that our strategy is working and that 2021 was a transformative year for Verizon, and it clearly sets us up for a high impact year in 2022. We have now assembled the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of high-quality assets, leveraging our best-in-class technology to extend our network leadership to address more opportunities than anyone else in the market. We're widely being recognized for both what we have accomplished and for the 28th time in a row, J.D. Power ranked Verizon first for network quality. This is our 175th J.D. Power Network Quality Award in 18 years. At the same time, we continue to support our four stakeholders: shareholders, customers, employees and society as a responsible business. Verizon leads the industry in sustainability. We are ranked ahead of our peers, both by the Drucker Institute and JUST 100, and we are confident that our multi-stakeholder strategy will lead to long-term shareholder value. We have a team and expertise to lead the country into a vibrant mobile computing future. Verizon has the best engineers in the world, and they have built a world forward reliable and scalable network. This asset is the foundation and the catalyst for our accelerating growth. So we begin 2022 with a strong portfolio of assets. We're executing our 5G strategy, making great progress on our five vectors of growth and delivering a premier customer experience. This significant momentum sets us up for 2022 and beyond. Let me give an update on the financial and operation metrics. During 2021's first quarter, we set clear targets. As we close out 2021 and enter in 2022, I'm proud to report that we delivered on all of them plus some, and our achievements will only capitalize even greater value creation in 2022. On our January 19 C-band deployment, we covered more than 90 million POPs and millions of homes in more than 1,700 cities, well ahead of plan on making excellent use of the incremental capital spend to augment and accelerate our business opportunities. Today, we cover more than 95 million POPs as the team is progressing also brought more than 15,000 additional 5G Ultra Wideband small cells in service, exceeding our annual goal and nearly doubling our total 5G millimeter wave presence, increasing our fiber footprint to create a state-of-the-art multipurpose network. At our Investor Day last year, we said we would have 5% to 10% traffic in urban areas covered by millimeter wave. Today, we're almost at 10%, it's exceeding our expectation. This confirms our millimeter wave strategy. All this had stage for last week's Verizon Ultra Wideband launch. We're excited and pleased with what we have seen so far from customer reception to network performance. We have grown our network significantly. We finished 2021 with over 20 million households covered for our fixed wireless access solutions and T-band adds millions more homes. For business, our initial C-band expansion will recover more than 1.7 million organizations with Verizon 5G business Internet across 900 cities. We will reach new retail and business clients by offering a breadth of plan options that make our capabilities relevant to their lives. Our new mix and match 4.0 offerings allow customers to pick the 5G plan they want with options for savings on home Internet. For businesses, we offer business unlimited offerings that bring choice and power to the professional market. In addition to our network achievements, we closed on two large strategic transactions in 2021. We sold Verizon Media Group to Apollo Global Management for $5 billion in a transaction that closed in September, retaining minority ownership. And in November, we completed our strategic acquisition of TracFone, positioning Verizon as the number one provider within the value segment. This opportunity enables us to deepen our relationship with new customers while delivering more enhanced services. TracFone is being rapidly integrated into our operation. The acquisition added 20 million customers to our prepaid model and cements Verizon as a leading prepaid vendor at Walmart and Best Buy forming a strong foundation of our retail efforts. We also continue to reach new customers through bundled Internet telephone and television services. Fios Internet adds in 2021 were our best since 2014, and we continue to expand availability of the best-in-class service. Importantly, we strengthened our relationship with our customers adding more connections, including more than 0.5 million new wireless postpaid phone net adds, while maintaining and cultivating our loyal, high-quality relationships. We provided additional value for our customers through our unique partnership strategy with the best brands that are meaningful to people, lives and businesses. This includes content partnership with NFL, Disney, Apple, Discovery and Niantic to name a few. For businesses, we offer mobile edge compute capabilities, something we're first in the world with alongside industry leaders like AWS, Google and Microsoft. Disruptions to consumer and industrial supply chains throughout 2021 and extending into this year have affected all industries and brought digital connectivity to the central focus in the lives of our stakeholders. That said, Verizon has executed effectively under discussion as demonstrated by our successful network expansion and network service launches. Once again, our financial performance demonstrates our strategy is working. Our focus on profitable volume continues to drive wireless service revenue growth of 4.7% in 2021. And in the fourth quarter, 74% of our customers subscribed to an unlimited plan compared to 71% in Q3. Just over one-third of our unlimited subscribers have unlimited premium. This leaves room for continued step-up expansion. Our multipurpose network and flexible plans will also help customers to upgrade handsets and devices. We saw quick adoption of 5G handsets throughout 2021 in anticipation of new services. One-third of our customers' handsets are now 5G-enabled compared to about 25% in the third quarter. We raised our earnings per share and wireless service revenue guidance during the year and deliver on both including 10% EPS growth. We promised also $10 billion in cost savings, and we deliver ahead of schedule. However, we continuously strive to more efficiently manage our business. We generated strong cash flows to support our investments and financial commitment, and we delivered our 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payments while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. As for our focus on ESG, Citizen, Verizon has also delivered on its promises. We took action towards meeting our 2025 goals, including spending to support technology education and adoption to bridge digital divide and contracting for significant renewable energy capacity, positioning the Company to achieve over 50% renewable energy goal by 2025. Matt will highlight on our performance and 2022 guidance in detail. But we will target organic service and other revenue of around 3% as well as EBITDA growth of 2% to 3%. With the right assets in place and a sound strategy to reach consumers and businesses with 5G capabilities and mobile edge computing on our multipurpose network, Verizon has unlimited potential. 2022 will demonstrate this. Now, I will turn the call over to Matt to walk you through our fourth quarter and full year performance in greater detail. Thank you, Matt. The assets are in place to make 2022 Verizon's best year yet. Coming off a catalyst year, we are excited to execute on our 5G growth and deliver the financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day back in March of last year. We have clear priorities for the year. We will continue our legacy of disciplined execution and look forward to delivering against our operation and financial targets that Matt just outlined. We expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3% in 2022. And we also expect to increase EBITDA by 2% to 3%. We commit to strengthen and growing our core business and commercializing our unique assets. By combining our Verizon Ultra Wideband with the new mix and match plans, we can supercharge 5G Ultra Wideband adoption to enhance customer experiences and to increase average revenue per user. At the same time, we will continue to expand our fixed wireless access positioning Verizon as a premier nationwide broadband provider. We believe that Verizon's fixed wire access offering will drive the next leg of broadband growth, increasing our market share and reach. We will innovate in our business of business offerings, bringing mobile edge computing to our enterprise clients and transform the Internet of Things from a vision to reality. You should continue to expect us to sign new clients and provide examples on how the mobile edge compute is addressing the complex needs of our customers. We will benefit from our leading position in the value segment. The integration of TracFone will form the basis of deep and productive relationships that can grow to meet our customers' changing needs throughout life. We will continue to run Verizon as a purpose-driven organization. We will pursue C-band and 5G leadership because these technologies are critical for economic prosperity and driving innovation for all, not just for Verizon. We will continue to serve all of our stakeholders, shareholders, customers, employees and society. And lastly, I also hope to see you all again at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3. With that, I hand it back to Brady. Thank you, Brett. Let me start and get additional matter. When it comes to the growth in 2022, first of all, I think, we're coming in with a great momentum from 2021, both in our business and in our consumer units. Both of them have done a great job at the end of last year. Topping that, of course, with the C-band launch, which we're very excited about, and we see a very, very good performance with our new offerings, both on the business side and the consumer side with mix and match and all of that. That all great, of course, for us, what we feel is a great momentum coming into this year, and we also have the step-ups and as you heard me and Matt talking even though we are continuing to step up our customers, we even have more to do there. And we have a couple of years of more growth coming from that ARPA expansion. So coming into the year, we feel really good about the momentum we have, but also about opportunity in the market on the wireless market. Matt will come back. But on the broadband piece, just quickly then, we, of course, are very excited over the Fios broadband. What we saw last year was the best year in 2014. We will continue to expand the footprint and because we have such a good performance on it and customers love it. And then on top of that, as I said, fixed wirless access is now coming into a totally different model. We have it on 4G. We have millimeter wave. And then, of course, turning on the C-band earlier this month, we just opened up new opportunities for us. Of course, we want to see fixed-wire access continue to grow for us, and this is a super focus for the team. And you asked where the customer comes. First of all, all the fixed virus customers will have. They use these as the primary broadband solution for them. That's very important because that we see on the usage on them. So you saw back up or secondary line on fixed virus access is the primary broadband usage. And secondly, these customers are coming from basically cable and DSL areas where they are using that. So that's where we take them from. They are new to us as broadband customers, and sometimes they are new. They're not even wireless customers. So that's where we get them from right now. And I think that, that's our sweet spot right now when we're a national broadband provider. So all in all, excited we're getting into '22 with all the assets we have right now and, hey, what is sort of the year with all of that coming together so early in the year for us with C-band. Thank you. On the competitive environment, yes, we saw that in the fourth quarter. And when we are saying that we have the guidance for 2020, we continue to believe it's going to be competitive, but we have great assets. And of course, what is different in the first quarter this year for many other years is, of course, called 5G Ultra Wideband and their C-band. That's a big difference. We are really excited over that announcement. And as you saw, we now cover more than 95 million POPs, and we have great offerings for to our business customers and for our consumers and then topping that fixed piece access and the mobility case. So -- and later on, we can come to talk about mobile edge compute because this also augment our potential in the mobile edge compute. Before I let Matt comment on the CapEx, I just want to say what Matt and I said at the Investor Day last year, we're going to see over the years right now that our capital intensity going down and partly what is what you see in the BAU guidance we do right now. We have done our fiber for a couple of years. We have done the majority of the long hauls, so to say. And we also see that with 5G expansion on C-band, we clearly see over time an offset on the 4G that we can reduce on that. And much of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that is commonality from the data center to the edge, that also has been ongoing for a while. So that's why we are feeling good about the BAU coming down. And then on the C band, you're absolutely right, $10 billion is the amount we decided and we told Kyle and the team to spend the faster you can because we want these assets up and running as soon as possible. And that's what you see the 5% to 6% right now, we do last year. So, that's with a normal calculation that is roughly two left in the in the year to come. But when it comes to future guidance on CapEx, I think we have to wait with that. But clearly, our target is to continue to be very capital efficient all the time here. Matt? I think this is sort of the full strategy of Verizon coming together. This was we envisioned and some of us was in conference room in New York in 2018 and talking about Verizon intelligent Edge network. I wanted to build that in order to serve a market where capacity and connectivity is needed all across the network for all type of customers. And clearly, the C-band is just adding enormous lot of capacity for us. But don't forget the millimeter wave now. I mean, that strategy is really working for us as well because we take a lot of the high-volume areas with millimeter wave, which unleash out the spectrum. And hey, we haven't even starting to do a carrier aggregation and using part of our spectrum yet coming into the 5G. So, I would say, clearly, we will be more aggressive on it, especially on fixed wires access because we feel so good about the capacity management and we have the best engineers in the industry. They have never failed the strategies that were put up. So, I feel really good about our capacity. We can go wherever we want. We have Tami and Manon, the two CEOs of our units, going hard on to all the products we have in all angles of the network. So yes, I think we feel really good about our capacities right now and what the team is doing, it's just amazing. Thank you. So first of all, as you heard, our deployment on C-band has been extremely successful, basically deliver a quarter ahead, and the guys has brought up so much site that's just amazing. Then you know also that voluntary, we agreed to not turn on some portion of the sites close to the airports, which is a smaller portion of the totality. I would say this is good progress. Everybody is focused. We have the highest assurance from the White House that this will be resolved very soon. I follow this person and myself. But again, it's a smaller portion of the network. The big thing is doesn't impact our business at the moment, meaning by customers that we can serve. But clearly, we want this to be resolved as soon as possible. So the pressure is on everybody involved to make this fixed. When it comes to fixed wireless access, you're right. I mean we have now, for a couple of years, learned all the way from billing, customer care how to work with fixed virus access. And I think that's a really good way for us to learn going into the second or into '22 when it comes to fixed wireless access. So of course, we have high ambitions internally for fixed wireless access and the team is really well prepared for it. Okay. I just need to correct myself. It's going so faster. So I said 90 million POPs covered with C-band. We have 95%, as I said, as of today. So I just wanted to correct that. My colleagues here comment that I didn't remember that. It's going fast for us here. On TracFone, when we talked about the integration. As we took this over end of November, the team is doing a great job together. What we are doing from the Verizon side is, of course, bringing our platforms, the network, the products, the experience in IT and all of that, that's what we're bringing. That's where we bring synergies. Then, of course, we're going to have these brands serving their market in their way and seeing that we coexist together with them. So that is really what is bringing out then is some investments in the beginning as we said. But over time, this should be a really good addition to us, and it will be incremental from the beginning. So I'm really excited with TracFone because now we serve the full market and being number one in that segment as well. So it just plays into the overall thinking about our five excise growth, having more places to grow than anybody else in the market, and this is just another vector for us. Matt? I'll start with the second question, and then Matt will walk you through a little bit on TracFone. Yes, on the market, as I said before, I mean, we compete well in a competitive market, and we prepare ourselves for that. And we think our offerings, both on wireless and fixed wireless access, including Fios support, of course, is very strong. Ultimately, we have a different recipe than many others, the best network then we have all our partnerships that nobody else has. And finally, we have a great value proposition to our customer with mix and match where they can pick and shoes. So that's why we feel really good going into this year. And with everything we have been doing in the last couple of years, we know it's working. Our strategy is working here. And clearly, we have also the owners' economics on both wireless and broadband, which is different from anybody else basically, that we actually have this owner because we have built a network from the data center to the edge with commonality, testing type of equipment. And then at the edge, we decide what type of access points we have depending on customer and solutions. And then we give them different applications and bundles with Disney+, whatever or if there are other solutions and I think that's unique for us. We have created that in the last three years, and that's why we sit here right now and feeling, we're going to compete well in this market even though it's competitive. Yes, I'll start with the mobile age compute. No, as you have seen, we have a great progress on that. First of all, we have three different business cases on the same infrastructure again where the private mobile edge compute, where the public mobile is compute and we have private 5G network. That's what we're working on right now. And they are a little bit different use cases, of course, of all of them. Some are a little bit more B to B to C and some are really B to B. What we are doing right now is, of course, bringing all that live together with our partners, and we have the three largest web-scale players in the industry working with us on all of these. And suddenly, we start seeing with every announcement that you see in the market, if it's IoT solutions or Metaverse solution, I mean that's what we built the network in normal edge compute. So this year, I'm looking for taking many of our proof-of-concept together with large enterprises and application developers to commercial deals. If you would put it in timing, I would say the fixed wire access is a little bit earlier, as we said all the time. The mobility case is first on 5G, then fixed wireless access, and we talked a lot about that and then mobile edge compute. So, you're going to see more about us gaining and winning a lot of businesses because we are the only one in the market in the mobile age compute. So that's what you're going to see in '22. And then of course, we're going to build up our revenue base going into '23. Thank you for the question. First of all, I think what we have designed this network and our go-to-market is optionality for our customers. If the market goes to more convergence, definitely, we will be there. We're going to be nationwide with broadband, and we're going to be nationwide with wireless. If a stand-alone business, we can do that as well because we have the scale right now, all the way from our network, to our capacity, to our IP, to our go-to-market, customer care, all the way we have scale. So we are just playing with the -- where the market is going and giving the optionality. The same goes for our content deals. I mean trying to see that our customers can pick and choose what they want and see if they want it. They can keep it or they can continue with it. So all in all, with our mix and match, our network, everything is set up for optionality of a customer choice. We are the Company that can give customer choice and then we have economies of scale in either of the solution. So if the market go converges, we're going to be there. If it's go separate, we're going to be there, and we're going to have economies both the -- and it will increase our leverage when it comes to profitability because this one network is one way to go to the market for us regardless of. Yes, I will answer on the fixed wireless. First of all, I think we have not changed our long-term strategy to be financial discipline when it comes to our customer acquisitions. We are focused on high-quality customers, and we will continue to do so. Our team is extremely methodical when it comes to do these offerings and see the long-term benefit for us and for the customer and what we give them. As I said, right now, in our fixed wire access, we have this bundle to see if that is what the market wants to have. But again, we have optionality with the pricing. We can do it standalone or we can do our premium on wireless. And I think all in all, again, we have ones economics on both of them. So, it should be possibly financially for us. And again, the team is very convinced that we have a really, really good formula here. And I have all the confidence in my consumer team, but don't forget the business team. The business team is doing fixed wireless actuals as well, and they're doing mobility as well, and they have a great opportunity. Again, we use our platforms, the long-term strategy we put in, in order to be using sort of the same type of solutions to our customer base and that we can scale and that's why we can the guidance we do right now for 2022 and feeling good about it. I'll let Matt start. Got so many questions... No, the only addition I would do is, of course, that when it comes to this initial build, I mean the vast, vast majority is on sites we already have. We have said it before. It's the same grid as the 4G, which is great for us, how we do this. And then we have normal expansions over time, but that's nothing unusually CAU. When it comes to the performance of the C band, this is a perfect sort of cliffhanger. It's a little bit early. Of course, we're excited, but we have Investor Day 3 of March. And I think that if we tune in there, you'll probably get something about the performance on our C-band. But early into it, I'm really pleased what the technology team have done and our partners have done so far, but stay tuned for the 3 of March, and we will talk more about that."

            "name": "Matt Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results where we continue to deliver strong financial and operating performance. Before I get into the 2021 results, let me add my own congratulations to the Verizon team for achieving our C-band build targets well ahead of schedule and for the successful commercial launch week. The C-band deployment provides so many opportunities for us. As Hans mentioned, our strategy is working and these results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively to drive new high-quality customers to our platforms while also serving our best-in-class customer base. We do this with the financial discipline that enables us to deliver attractive service revenue growth and profitability as evidenced by another strong earnings performance with healthy cash generation. It starts with our award-winning networks, which enable both our consumer and business organizations to deliver the best products, services and experiences to customers. With the acquisition of TracFone, the deployment of C-band spectrum, new mix and match plans, and the strongest and most innovative team in the industry, 2022 is positioned to be our best year yet. Let's take a look at these results beginning on Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, consolidated total revenue was $34.1 billion, down 1.8% from the prior year. Adjusting for the sale of Verizon Media Group on September 1, consolidated revenue grew 4.8%, strong wireless service revenue growth and wireless equipment revenue were offset by continued declines in legacy wireline products. Total wireless service revenue was up 6.5% for the quarter. The results were driven by a combination of ARPA and volume growth, consistent with our strategy and the contribution from the TracFone acquisition. For the full year, wireless service revenue grew 4.7%, including TracFone, and was in line with the increased guidance we provided at the end of the third quarter when adjusted for the TracFone acquisition. Total Fios revenue was $3.2 billion and grew 5.7% for the fourth quarter, driven by strong customer demand for our high-quality connectivity services. Full year FiOS revenue was approximately $12.7 billion, up 4.6% over the prior year. Service and other revenue grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, while on a reported basis it declined 5.4% from the prior year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $11.8 billion, relatively flat compared to last year as growth in consumer was offset by declines in business and the impact of the Verizon Media Group sale. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $48.4 billion, up 2.8% from the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2% down 50 basis points primarily due to higher equipment revenues. Earlier in the year and ahead of schedule, we achieved our $10 billion business excellent cost savings goal. We continue to drive efficiency in the business while operating with the best cost structure in the industry and expect strong operating leverage as we execute across all of our five vectors of growth. As Brady mentioned, for the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.31, up 8.3% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our business. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $5.39 was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance range and is a 10% increase over 2020 results. Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. The strength of our networks and brand, combined with our effective go-to-market strategy are driving improved competitive performance in the market. We continue to expand our high-quality mobility base with strong performance across consumer and business. At the same time, accelerating fixed wireless sales are complementing strong Fios results, expanding our broadband growth opportunity. For the quarter, we delivered 558,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, an increase over the 279,000 achieved during the same period last year. Postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.81%, roughly in line with the same period last year and better than pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the enduring loyalty of our customer base through ordinary and extraordinary times. Total broadband net adds, which includes consumer and business Fios, DSL and fixed wireless totaled $106,000, up 30,000 from the prior year. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, another strong result. Even with a slight uptick in voluntary churn, we continue to experience exceptionally low Fios Internet churn as customers trust the reliability of our network and the simplicity of our mix and match pricing. Our full year Internet net adds of 360,000 represented the best annual performance in 2014, and we now have 6.9 million Fios Internet customers. Demand for our fixed wireless access services continue to grow even before our C-band deployment. FWA net adds, which include both consumer and business fixed wireless products, totaled 78,000, up from 55,000 last quarter. This brings our total FWA customer base to approximately 223,000 at the end of the year. Now let's turn to our consumer group results. Fourth quarter represented another strong financial performance for consumer, highlighted by our best Fios revenue growth in the 2.0 area, wireless service revenue momentum and healthy profitability. We are clearing the benefits of our focused go-to-market organization. Consumer operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $25.7 billion, up 7.4% year-over-year. Service and other revenue of $19.4 billion was up 5.2% versus the prior year due to strong wireless and Fios revenue growth and a partial quarter contribution from TracFone. As Brady mentioned, the net revenue change from TracFone was approximately $700 million in the quarter, which included incremental service revenue of approximately $500 million year-over-year. For the full year, total Consumer revenue increased 7.6% from a year ago to $95.3 billion, and service and other revenue rose 3.4% to $75.5 billion. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter rose 7.7% to $14.6 billion, reflecting ongoing step-ups into unlimited and premium plans as well as the contribution from TracFone. Postpaid ARPA increased 3.2% from the year ago period driven by a higher premium unlimited mix and growth in products and services, such as content, cloud and device protection plans. For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $56.1 billion, up 4.7% from 2020 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.9 billion for the fourth, quarter up 5.6% from the year-ago period driven primarily by the strong growth in our broadband base. For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.3 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year or more than $400 million, driven by the service revenue growth. Margins were 40.3%, down 20 basis points from last year due to higher equipment revenues associated with increased volumes. For the full year, EBITDA was $41.6 billion up approximately 1.4 billion or 3.4% versus the prior year. Margins were 43.7% down from 45.5% in the prior year as a result of the approximately 28% equipment revenue growth in the year. Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our Consumer operating metrics. Our flexible mix and match plans are at the heart of our go-to-market strategy, supporting continued strong demand for higher tier premium mobility and broadband offerings. Postpaid phone net adds were $336,000 in the quarter. We competed effectively during the holiday season, even as the switcher pool remains soft compared to pre-pandemic levels due to elevated retention promotions in the marketplace. Fourth quarter phone gross adds were up approximately 11% compared to the same period last year, but were approximately 15% lower than the 2019 level. We continue to achieve customer retention with postpaid phone churn of 0.77% for the fourth quarter, relatively flat compared to the same period last year and well below pre-pandemic levels even as trading volumes pick. We maintained the momentum of attracting high-quality customers with approximately 60% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan and over one-third of our base accounts now on a premium unlimited tier. 5G penetration continued to expand with approximately 34% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device at year-end. We expect to drive further 5G Ultra Wideband adoption with the launch last week of our C-band spectrum to more than 90 million POPs, combined with our updated mix and match offerings introduced earlier this month. With the close of the acquisition, TracPhone results are now included in consumer prepaid. We finished the year as the nation's leading value segment provider with approximately 24 million total prepaid customers including the approximately 20 million customers acquired from TracFone. For the quarter, prepaid net customer losses totaled $85,000, which included 52,000 net losses on the TracFone businesses stemming from stronger demand for postpaid plans due to promos in that segment, coupled with handset supply constraint. Now let's move to Slide 10 to review the business group results. Operating revenue for the business segment was $7.8 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3.0% year-over-year. We faced elevated pressures in the quarter in both public sector and wholesale, and we expect these pressures to moderate in 2022. Full year operating revenue was $31.0 billion, up slightly year-over-year driven by strong wireless performance. Wireless service revenue increased 1.5% and wireless equipment revenue was up 9.6% in the fourth quarter. Wireless service revenue was driven by growth in small and medium business and enterprise performance improved for the fourth consecutive quarter and was the highest growth since the start of the pandemic. While this was partially offset by a decline in public sector due to the elevated distance learning activity in the year ago period, our Verizon frontline campaign is resonating with stakeholders, helping drive new customer growth. Wireline trends remain under pressure as we continue to face prior year comps that included pandemic buying. In addition, approximately one-third of our declines came from voice services where we continue to feel the impact of our strategic initiative to exit the low-margin international wholesale voice market. Business segment EBITDA was $1.8 billion, down 7.4% from the same quarter last year. Business segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, reflecting pressure in legacy wireline products and our commitment to invest in new product growth and drive customer demand for our wireless solutions. Full year margins were 24.2%, down 120 basis points from last year. We exited the year with strong momentum in business activity and demand for our wireless products. With the recent launch of our C-band spectrum, we are in an even better position to serve the 5G needs of our business customers throughout 2022. For the quarter, phone gross adds were up approximately 22% year-over-year and 8% from 4Q 2019 levels. The fourth quarter represented the strongest quarterly phone gross add performance for small and medium business and enterprise since launching Verizon 2.0. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, which was up slightly over the prior year. As a result, total postpaid phone net adds were $222,000, our best quarterly performance since the onset of the pandemic. Now let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. Cash generation remains strong for 2021 as we achieved our financial targets and executed on our capital allocation plan. We spent over $45 billion of C-band spectrum and expanded our portfolio with the TracFone acquisition, all while increasing our dividend for the 15th straight year and making progress to maintain a healthy balance sheet. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $39.5 billion for the year, a decline of $2.2 billion. This result primarily reflects strong performance in the business with increased adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion, offset by higher working capital from device payment receivables and slightly higher cash taxes. Capital spending in 2021 totaled $20.3 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while initiating the first phase of C-band deployment covering 90 million POPs. C-band-related CapEx was approximately $2.1 billion in 2021. As a result, free cash flow for the full year was $19.3 billion, down from $23.6 billion in 2020. The highlights of our financing activity in 2021 was efficiently funding our C-band spectrum investment in the first quarter. Since then, we are focused on further optimizing our cash position and debt maturity profile with activity to reduce or extend near-term maturities, while deploying excess cash to retire longer-dated high-coupon bonds. We accomplished this while maintaining ample flexibility to invest in our business such as fund in the recent TracFone acquisition. We are also active with our ABS funding program to finance the increased device payment receivables as consumers upgrade to 5G phones. We exited the year with $133.7 billion of net unsecured debt, a $3.7 billion reduction from the end of the first quarter. Our unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.8 times at year-end, in line with our 2021 Investor Day guidance. Our financing activities over the past two years have reduced our average portfolio borrowing costs by about 1% as compared to 2019, albeit with higher debt levels. Our cash balance at the end of the year was $2.9 billion, down approximately $7.0 billion sequentially, bringing us back to normal levels. Let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss our outlook for 2022. We have great momentum from the strong operating and financial results last year and are well positioned heading into the new year, and that momentum is reflected in our guidance for 2022. We took many strategic actions to position the Company for better growth and our increased guidance disclosures provide greater insight into our financial outlook. At our Investor Day last year, we provided guidance of at least 3% service and other revenue for 2022 and 2023. For 2022, we expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3%. On a reported basis, which includes the net impact of the sale of Verizon Media Group and our ownership of TracFone, service and other revenue growth is expected to range between 1.0% and 1.5%. Similarly, on a reported basis, wireless service revenue growth for 2022 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10%, driven by growth from our tiered unlimited strategy, the impact of the TracFone acquisition, and a ramping fixed wireless access contribution. Excluding the impact of the TracFone acquisition, wireless service revenue is expected to grow at least 3%. We expect total adjusted EBITDA to grow 2% to 3% in 2022, driven by top line growth and ongoing cost discipline. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $5.40 to $5.55. As the waterfall chart shows, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth, including a small positive net contribution from the TracFone and Media transactions to be offset by headwinds from below-the-line items. These items include approximately $0.15 from our C-band investment, including higher depreciation and lower capitalized interest as we put the spectrum into service, $0.07 share dilution as a result of shares issued in the TracFone acquisition, and other noncash impacts such as D&A and pension and OPEB expense. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year, excluding C-band, is expected to be between $16.5 billion and $17.5 billion, a decrease from the $18.2 billion in 2021, and as we have started our progress towards lower capital intensity. C-band capital spend is anticipated to be between $5 billion to $6 billion as we continue to build out the initial markets and begin preparations to deploying Phase II spectrum. For 2022, cash flow from operations are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by increased working capital from device payment receivables as well as higher cash taxes. We are extremely excited for 2022 and expect it to be our biggest year yet. The second wave of 5G is here, and we are leading the way into the future of connectivity. We have the necessary assets and strategy to unlock the full potential of our growth vectors. With that, I will hand it over to Hans to discuss our 2022 strategic priorities. Yes. Thanks, Brett. So just a couple of follow-ups on the service and other revenues. So certainly, we're excited about all the new opportunities ahead of us, such as fixed wireless, as Hans mentioned, and the other five growth vectors. But as you think about 2022, that organic approximately 3% will largely be driven by the momentum we saw coming out of last year. On the business side, very strong volumes in the second half of the year in SMB and Global Enterprise, it gives us a great platform to build on. I would expect the wireless service revenue growth in VBG to be above the 4.8% they did last year at or above that number. So, we'll see the benefit of the strong second half coming through in VBG there. On the consumer side, as Hans mentioned, we have approximately 30% of our customers with -- on a premium unlimited tier. So we have the opportunity to set more customers up. And with the new plans we announced earlier this month, we give customers an even bigger reasons for stepping up to those premium tiers. So that would be the major drivers of the growth during the year. We get into the second half of the year, start to see fixed wireless, especially as that base grows, we'll start to contribute there, but really built on the great momentum we have, coupled with our activities over the past few weeks gives us a lot of excitement as we think about '22. Yes. No, I'll just reiterate a couple of those comments. I mean, absolutely, we're sticking with the $10 billion of incremental. Very pleased with the aggressive pace that Kyle and team have been able to adopt there, which means that we see those -- what we did last year, plus five to six is year leaves a fairly small amount to come through in 2023. And after that, the C-band becomes part of our BAU CapEx number as we add capacity to the network. And we -- as Hans mentioned, we've discussed for a while now, the opportunities to see capital intensity come down and we're starting to see those come through, and they will really accelerate really on the back end of '23, but just one additional item in there. On the one fiber build we've been doing at the end of 2021, we reached a point where we had just over 50% of the markets where we have completed the core network build. So there's only success-based network build taking place in those 50% of the market over the course of the next couple of years. We'll completely complete the core build across all on fiber market. So you have that, you have the reduction in LTE spend as 5G starts to replace it in terms of carrying large amounts of capacity. Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, how much of the capacity millimeter wave has really started to pick up as well. And you can see there's a number of reasons why we feel good about capital intensity going forward here on the BAU. So we will be in a great place going forward. As you look at the spend for last year on C-band 2.1, that's obviously on a cash basis on an incurred basis, the activity in November and December, a large part of that will show up as CapEx in the first quarter here when we pay for those items. So, really strong momentum in terms of what the network team was doing last year. The flywheel is running at full speed now on the C-band build, and you see that with the activity this month so far. Yes. So Simon, on your question around inflation, I mean the -- as you mentioned, we successfully completed our cost reduction program by the end of the first quarter, three quarters ahead of target. That really puts us in a great place as you think about inflation because we haven't stopped our work on continuing to get more efficient just because we hit the target but it really got that muscle developed and the teams continue to look at ways to improve our processes, make them more efficient and also improve both the customer and employee experience. So, the teams have continued strong targets in that space as we head into 2022. We all know inflation is out there and certainly we'll see some of that. The good news is that we have a good part of our cost base is tied to longer-term contracts, which means we're not necessarily going to see the full impact of inflation and at the same pace at other industries are seeing. But certainly, it's real. We'll take actions to address that. The guidance that we gave was based off our expectation for -- to see an uptick in inflation this year. And there's a number of levers we have if we can pull if the situation evolves. Hi, Dave, on track. So I think as you walk through the things you described there, certainly, over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, we'll have the ability to bring all of the TracFone base onto the Verizon network and those customers get that step up in performance that you would expect when they come over. So as you recall, roughly two-thirds of the track base was already on the Verizon network. The other one-third will get migrated there. The final piece you mentioned was about once you've migrated them over the ability to step them up to postpaid. And look, those customers that want to step up to postpaid, we'll be in a great position to do so. With, as Hans mentioned, the mix and match structure given the customers' options as they move over to postpaid. But the TracFone acquisition wasn't based on bringing the ability to move more people over to postpaid. We want to have the best prepaid propositions in the marketplace we can complement what was already in place with the owner's economics we have. And so, we are in best position today for customers that want to stay on prepaid. We're going to have the best offer for those that want to move to postpaid, we can do that, too and just very excited about the opportunities that we now have with full ownership of the TracFone brands. Mike, on your first question around the guidance on the revenue. So specifically, is it from a volume standpoint, when I look at the business segment, we saw very strong performance by that group in the second half of the year. We're excited about the momentum they have. We assume that they will continue to perform strongly from Matt's standpoint into 2022. And as you heard earlier, expect them to be at least at the service revenue growth from '21 or above. So that will be driven by continued strength in SMB and Global Enterprise. And then on the consumer side, we assume that the switcher pool will continue to be constrained based on the activity in the marketplace. We will continue to be very strong in terms of customer retention, and we have the opportunity to step customers up. You saw us do that last year. And now we have the additional opportunities that come with that, with the new mix and match plans on C-band. So we have great opportunity there. But as I say, we assume the switch of pool will to show some limitations just because of some of the other activity out there. But even with that, we think we'll have very strong service revenue growth next year. And then, we bring fixed wireless access on top of that, as you think about getting into the back end of the year in subsequent periods. So very excited about the momentum that we see from a revenue standpoint. So thanks for the questions, Greg. So on the free cash flow for 2022, it starts with the strong cash generation from the business with the EBITDA, and you saw the EBITDA guide plus 2% to 3% driven from growth of the top line. That puts us in a good place. But I do expect we'll see working capital increase next year as we continue to support our customer activity, especially related to the device payment plans. Also as revenues and profitability increases, cash taxes have a nasty habit of increasing as well. So that will, of course, be in the CFFO. And then as you get down to free cash flow, as you mentioned, the CapEx will play in there. We said last year, we'd spend that incremental $10 billion over five years. We're going to see the biggest part of that come through this year. But you're also seeing the rest of the CapEx number being lower year-over-year, that range of $16.5 million to $17.5 million versus $18.2 billion, we've done not just last year but the last two years. So you'll see that come through. And really kind of linking that with your second question, but what you really see is our ability to execute across all parts of the capital allocation model, invest in the business with the -- not just the buying the spectrum, but accelerating the deployment of it, investing in TracFone at the same time, increasing the dividend for the 15th year in a row, continuing to strengthen the balance sheet. We said at the Investor Day last year, our leverage ratio would be about 2.9x at the end of first quarter with all the financing for the spectrum, and we'd be at 2.8x by the end of the year. We hit that target. So you see already coming down while doing that additional spend. So certainly excited about the opportunities that the cash generation of the business give us, and then as you think about rising rates, the team has done a great job of maximizing the debt portfolio. You see that in the interest expense. The majority of our debt is fixed rate. So it would take interest rates being at elevated levels for a long time period for that to flow through into our debt complex. So I think the way that we're managing the debt profile means that the rate environment will not cause us to change how we think about capital allocation model here. And certainly, we're focused on continuing to execute aggressively against all of the pillars of the model. Peter, so I'll start off with the -- taking a look at your question around the '22 guidance. So certainly expect wireless service revenue to have another good year starting with the momentum we have coming out of '21, both in business and in consumer. And then we add obviously to that bringing TracFone in and also with the C-band and the new mix and match pricing. So we feel good there. We would expect in the legacy wireline business to see the some of the secular trends that we've been experiencing for a number of years now continue, providing an offset in there and you see the impact of that also as you think about the profitability. But certainly, the 2% to 3% on EBITDA, we think is -- shows that the business continues to grow, continues to increase the cash generation. And as we bring C-band online and execute across all five vectors of growth, we have opportunities to see that margin line expand even further as subsequent years as we go here. So the margin growth, the cash flow growth across the business should continue to be strong not just in '22, but for a number of years out. Hans, do you want to speak to fixed wireless. So on the C-band build, so look, certainly, we are not complete with coverage from a build standpoint with the initial $10 billion. The $10 billion is incremental. As I said, once we spend the $10 million ongoing C-Band bill becomes part of our BAU CapEx. And you heard our comments earlier around expectation for continued improved capital intensity. But certainly, within the $10 billion is helping us build out significant parts of the first 46 markets, the ones we got access to and turned on last week. And also begin the early build in the other markets that are scheduled be turned on in December of '23. So, we'll get a substantial part of the coverage for C-Band built with the $10 billion, certainly not the whole thing. But then as we do that, traffic moves off of the LTE network to our need to continue to spend on capacity and the LTE network comes down, that's how we'll continue to fund the C-band build going forward as a result of those other efficiencies. So hopefully, that provides a little more detail on the..."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. As a reminder, we've entered the quiet period for the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum auction, so we will not be able to comment on our spectrum holdings or strategy. Now let's take a look at the consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.55 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported results include a net pre -tax gain on the sale of Verizon Media of $706 million and a net pre-tax charge of approximately $247 million, which includes a net charge of $144 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities and $103 million related to severance charge for voluntary separations under our existing plans. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41 in the third quarter compared to a $1.25 a year ago. Please note, our results include two months of Verizon Media as the sale to Apollo Funds closed on September 1st. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the third quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. We had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth. This was supported by strong net additions in wireless and broadband, which are both translated to bottom line growth. This definitely confirms our strategy to grow our business with high quality offerings. As I've said throughout the year, we have all the assets we need to extend our number one position in the market. Our strategy remains unchanged and we're delivering on everything we promised, and we're gaining momentum on all of five vectors of growth. We have more paths to grow than anybody else and we're confident with our growth targets throughout the years based on our third quarter and continued momentum into the fourth quarter. As an evidence, we're updating financial guidance for the full year. We now expect total wireless service revenue growth of around 4%, which is on the high-end of our prior guidance, and adjusted EPS of $5.35 to $5.40, up from $5.25 to $5.35. We remain on track to achieve our targeted CapEx levels in 2021, assuming no further disruption in the supply chain. Our team is working diligently and doing a fantastic work with vendors and suppliers to ensure we have adequate equipment to meet our C-Band build and that we have devices that are customer want. Our operational excellence and our partnership strategy is the best in the industry, which I've been so impressed by since I joined Verizon. And in times like this, it matters. Let's talk about business. We continue to provide the best-in-class experience across the board. On the network front, third parties continue to recognize us as the best network experience. These includes RootMetrics for the 16th consecutive time and J.D. Power for the 27th consecutive time. Our network team is doing a great job. On the commercial front, we've got great momentum into five-year adoption, with over 25% of our consumer phone base using a 5G-capable device. This is tracking well ahead of the 4G adoption, as I've said before. For context, 12 months of the 4G launched, 10% of the devices were in 4G. Less than 12 months after 5G DSS launched, more than the double were on 5G devices and it's growing at a rapid pace. These combined with our millimeter-wave strategy is an important combination and that is paying off. In the third quarter, the total millimeter wave uses more than double sequentially. We're doing more gigabit of usage in a month now than we did in all the first quarter. In some or more established build-outs, we're seeing more than 20% of usage on millimeter wave. And we're on track to have 5% to 10% of all traffic in the urban millimeter wave polygons by year-end. For Business segment, we continue to add wireless subscribers and take broadband share in our ILEC footprint with Fios. And finally, we delivered significant value creation and strategy refinement with a sale of the Verizon Media Group in September, depending TracFone acquisition and also the issuance of our third green bond, which is a vital step towards our net zero goal in 2035. All this was accomplish in tandem with a strong quarter results. When it comes to the financials, we're on track to meet and exceed all of our 2021 guidance. We expect to have a strong finish of the year as we approach the launch of C-Band. We continue to deliver excellent revenue performance in wireless service and within Fios. We have a diversified path for revenue growth with all five vectors contributing. EBITDA was up 3.3% year-over-year. And on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 12.8%. Our capital allocation stands firm. We invest in our business to create shareholder value. We continue to increase our dividend, which we did for the 15 consecutive year. And Matt and team are working diligently on our debt reduction. As we said last quarter, our guidance race is broad-based and across all our five vectors of growth. Consumer segment EBITDA increased by 2%, driven by positive trends in customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services, and content, as well as prepaid and reseller growth. The service revenue momentum in the third quarter was driven by continued execution of our migration strategy to higher-valued price plans, as well as high-quality net adds. But our growth is more than that. Much of our long-term growth is in fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute. Our strategy is becoming a national broadband provider with the best access to the tech for our customers includes Fios, fixed wireless access on 5G, 4G millimeter-wave and C-Band. When it comes to the mobile edge compute, we are the mobile edge compute leader, both in public and private. Thanks for great partnerships. And we just announced a private mobile edge compute partnership with Amazon that we're pleased with. And this just scratches the surface on how we will continue to utilize our assets. We're confident in our growth opportunities as we move into the investment cycle with C-Band. Before I hand it over to Matt, I want to briefly touch on our broadband expansion. We're on track to meet our fixed wireless access household coverage targets with an expected 15 million homes passed by the end of the year between 4G and 5G. To date, five-year home is in 57 markets and the 4G LTE home in over 200 markets across all 50 states. In addition to fixed wireless access, we're pleased with the great performance or Fios and continue to grow the open for sales volumes within our footprint. We're on track on exceeding all the commitments for 2021 and on track for long-term growth expectations outlined in our Investor Day earlier this year. You can expect us to provide 2022 guidance during our Q4 21 earnings call. And now, Matt, over to you.\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered strong financial and operating performance. As we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth as a goal in itself, but on high-value volume growth that will yield sustainable increases in revenue and profitability going forward. By delivering the best-in-class network experiences to customers with additional services and products like Disney+ that others can't provide, our strategy is focused on increasing the value we received from every connection. As you can see from our results, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. In the third quarter, consolidated total revenue was $32.9 billion, up 4.3% from prior year. Our results are inclusive of two months of Media revenue, which approximated $1.4 billion on a segment basis. Excluding Verizon Media, total revenue grew 5.5%. Our service and other revenue growth rate was 0.5% and 1.6% without Verizon Media. Equipment revenue growth was approximately 30% compared to the prior year, mainly due to the timing of iconic device launches and the continued pandemic recovery. Fios revenue was 3.2 billion up 4.7% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in customers, as well as our efforts to increase the value of each customer by encouraging them to step up in speed tiers. Total wireless service revenue, which is the sum of consumer and business, was $17.1 billion, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year. The results were driven by higher access revenue, volume growth, and products. We are creating more paths to growth with connectivity and non-connectivity services. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $12.3 billion up 3.3% from prior year. Top-line growth and a reduction in non-equipment related expenses contributed to the year-over-year EBITDA growth. And that EBITDA growth is helping us drive EPS growth. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was a $1.41, up year-over-year by 12.8%. Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on bringing in high-quality net adds, a key component in helping us continue to deliver strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. We are seeing strong demand for connectivity across our consumer and business units. Our Mix and Match value propositions, network quality, and unique partnerships are resonating with both new and existing customers. For the quarter, we delivered 429,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds. up more than 50% from prior year and in line with 2019 levels. We're seeing growth in new accounts, as well as high retention levels, allowing us to grow our base with high-quality net adds, phone churn for the quarter was 0.74%, well below pre -pandemic levels. Churn continues to benefit from a number of sustainable factors, including our best-in-class network with unmatched reliability and coverage and overall value propositions within our consumer and business unlimited plans. Additionally, consumer payment patterns continue to be better than pre -pandemic norms. Total broadband net adds, defined here as Fios, DSL, and fixed wireless; were 129,000. Fios Internet net add were 104,000 compared to 144,000 last year. As a reminder, last year's 3Q Fios results included a benefit from a higher backlog entering the quarter, as we had largely paused installs in Q2 2020 due to COVID. Fios has continued momentum driven by our best-in-class value proposition, built on network quality, and our Mix and Match pricing structure. This combination is helping us to take share and deliver historically low churn rates. For the first time we're providing fixed wireless net adds, which include both consumer and business fixed wireless products. We are building momentum and our pre C-Band success in Q3 demonstrates there is demand for the product from consumers and businesses. Both our 5G and LTE fixed wireless products are performing very well. We're pleased with what we're seeing around the install process, as well as the quality and reliability of the product. Now, let's turn to our Consumer Group results. Our Consumer Group had another strong quarter, continuing the momentum that we've been seeing in wireless and Fios. Total revenue was $23.3 billion up 7.3% year-over-year. Service and other revenue was $18.8 billion, an improvement of 2.5% versus prior year. These results include strong wireless revenue, as well as growth in Fios. Fios revenue was $2.9 billion, up 4.3% year-over-year mainly driven by growth in our Internet base of approximately 400,000 or 6.2% over the past year and migration to higher speed. Our actions around Mix and Match, which include a broadband first approach is helping us to grow with Fios revenue and Consumer EBITDA. We still see plenty of room for additional growth within Fios as we continue to increase our share Mix and Match penetration rates and are open for sale locations. Wireless service revenue is $14 billion up 4% from the prior year. We have been driving access gains both in growing accounts and phone net ad, as well as by continuing to execute on our migration strategy. As a result of migrations and step-ups, over 30% of our account base is now on premium unlimited plans. Our growth in access is being complemented by product revenue, which includes items such as protection plans, content, and others. Our wide range of product offerings helps us to not only grow revenue, but provides differentiated experiences and more value to our customers. For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year or more than $200 million, driven by our high quality service and other revenue gains coming from multiple growth vectors. These results show the impact of our strategy to enhance the value of each connection, which we believe will drive continued growth into the future. The Mix and Match pricing structure for both wireless and Fios provides tremendous opportunity to migrate customers to higher-value tiers and bringing customers and higher value plans. We're very pleased with how this strategy is working to help us increase value from our base and from new customers. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout our results. Postpaid phone net adds were 267,000 above our Q3 performance in 2019 and 2020. the performance was consistent during the period, as we are able to grow accounts and deliver sustainably low churns throughout the quarter. Most importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the quality of customers we're adding. With approximately 66% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan. And Q3 was another quarter in which we saw a strong acceleration in our 5G penetration, exiting the quarter with over 25% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device, which is great progress in advance of our launch of 5G service from C-Band spectrum in the coming months. Fios Internet net adds were 98,000 for the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing, especially on retention. Now, let's move to Slide 11 to review the business group results. Our business segment continues to see strong demand for wireless services across multiple verticals. We are continuing to focus on what we believe will be the highest growth portions of the business segment, our small and medium business unit, private wireless, and the Mix space or enterprise customers, as well as building momentum for fixed wireless access to serve multiple customer groups. Total revenues for the business segment was $7.7 billion. We continue to see growth in wireless revenue being offset by ongoing legacy wireline declines. Wireless service revenue was $3.1 billion up 3.6% year-over-year. We saw quarter-over-quarter expansion driven by small and medium business, which was partially offset by distance learning prices in public sector. Wireline revenues continue to be pressured by secular trends, while also facing elevated year-over-year comps due to 2020 COVID spending. Consistent with our focus on driving high-value business, in the wholesale space we continue to rationalize our international voice traffic which is contributing to the revenue decline shown on the slide. Business segment EBITDA was $1.9 billion, down 2.4% from the same quarter last year, and business segment EBITDA margin was 24.8% in the quarter. While secular trends within wireline will continue to put pressure on margins in the near-term, we're encouraged by the growth opportunities associated with our business transformation efforts as they start to gain traction. Our market leadership in wireless across all customer groups and our continued investment in primary growth areas for Verizon Business Group will position us to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the future. We are encouraged by the results we delivered for the highest value portions of the segments in 3Q. Phone gross add volumes were above pre -pandemic levels, up 11.4% year-over-year and up 3% versus the same quarter in 2019. Total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 276,000. To better highlight some of the trends, on the slide we've broken out the net adds by public sector, and our higher-growth commercial businesses, which includes small and medium business and enterprise. During 3Q 2020, the commercial space primarily within small and medium business was suppressed. While public sector, buoyed by distance learning programs saw elevated net adds. In 3Q '21, we've seen a rebound in the commercial space, while distance learning disconnects have driven public sector volumes to lower levels. We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter. A portion of distance learning disconnects also impacted our phone churn and net add performance. Despite this, we delivered postpaid phone net adds of a 162,000. Now, let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $31.2 billion. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by lower cash taxes last year from a onetime benefit and higher working capital requirements this year due to greater volumes. Year-to-date capital spending totaled $13.9 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the rates and capacity of our 5G ultra wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $1 billion through the third quarter, and we have placed orders for approximately $2 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously guided incremental CapEx range of two to $3 billion for the year as we accelerate our C-Band deployment. The net results to cash flow from operations and capital spending is $17.3 billion of free cash flow for the 9-month period. Net unsecured debt at quarter-end was a $131.6 billion, a $5.2 billion decrease versus the prior quarter. In addition to our third green bond issuance, we extended over $4.6 billion of near-term debt into a new 2032 maturity. As we continue to optimize borrowing costs and our debt profile, our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.7 times. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $9.9 billion, which included the proceeds associated with our sale of Verizon Media Group. We expect lower levels of cash on hand as we progress through the fourth quarter and approach the close of the TracFone acquisition while continuing to execute on our business strategy within our capital allocation framework. Let's move onto Slide 14 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. We continued our strong first-half performance momentum in the third quarter. Hans and I are very pleased with the hard work our team is putting forth. And we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we prepare for the C-Band launch. Our strong year-to-date results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter are allowing us to update guidance on both wireless service revenue growth, and EPS. Wireless service revenue growth is now expected to be around 4.0%, the higher end of the prior guidance. Adjusted EPS guidance is being increased to $5.35 to $5.40 up from the prior range of 525 to 535. Our guidance for the effective tax rate is unchanged. CapEx guidance is also unchanged. Though I'd note that our assumption for our BAU spend of $17.5 to $18.5 billion is dependent upon no material changes in the current state of our supply chain. Our team continues to execute on our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results. We are attracting high-quality customers that see value in our products and services, evidenced by growth in accounts, migrations, and step-ups. I look forward to continued momentum as we wrap up the year and position our base to take full advantage of all the things 5G Built Right has to offer. With that, I will hand it over to Hans to wrap up our prepared remarks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. As you heard, we delivered a solid third quarter results and we are on track to meet or exceed all our 2021 commitments to the investment community. Our strategy is working and I'm confident in the strategy we have to deliver both strong results and premium experiences going forward. As we look ahead, we continue to focus on expanding our 5G leadership, capitalizing on wireless momentum and work towards our C-Band launch, deploying differentiating experiences for our customers, and execute our network as a service to actually deliver all 5 vectors of growth, and we look forward to delivering on all fronts and sharing our results in the coming months. With that, I hand it back to Brady.\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick : Hi. Thanks, guys. Hans, you discussed continued momentum into the fourth quarter and I see you recently pulled back on the more aggressive retention plans. Can you talk about what competition looks like in consumer right now, and any shift in underlying demand? And then second for Matt, given the strong performance in the recurring revenue businesses, does it makes sense to be less aggressive on reducing leverage and maybe allocate some free cash flow to buybacks given the low multiple on the stock? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Phil. Let me start with the competitive landscape. Yes, there is, of course, a little bit more competitive landscape right now, but let me remind you on a couple of things. First of all, as we have learned from the history, I mean, broadband and mobility is two of the most important infrastructure for any person in this country and in the world. So it\u2019s not strange that there is competition. Secondly, we're in a moment where 5G scaling, the economy is strong, so of course that's a moment where we see a lot of competition. But anyhow, if you look at our numbers, we are competing extremely effectively. We are gaining the high-quality customers regardless all the type of competition we have. Not only that, the money if you look at our growth of 3.9%, we feel really good about that as well. That won't come to our service revenue. And we have been going back and forth on our promos. And the reason is that Roman and his team on the consumer side, they look at long-term profitability, high-quality customers when they come in and doing a promo. And right now we feel very good about how we compete in the market. So we're always going to have promos when we think is the right timing of it. So we feel really good about it. And as we also saw that Matt talked about our increased guidance as well. So all in all, we feel good how we compete in this environment. And if you look at the track record, the last couple of quarter has been really strong in consumer and Ronan and the whole team are doing a great job, so I feel good about that. When it comes to the capital allocation, I'll let -- I can just say that we -- our capital allocation is clear. I mean, we focus number one, on investing in business and we are investing in the business this year and both in CapEx, the spectrum and all of that, so that's number one. But we also have, as I said, I mean, our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase and Matt and I, we constantly see that we have a position for the board, so they can continue to do that and we will continue to do that. And then we have our debt reduction, which Matt will talk about. And finally, we have buybacks that we can do all the time. What I can tell you is that we are going to have a conversation with the Board, which is the best way of doing capital allocation, the priorities and we\u2019ll continue to do so to see that our shareholders get the best out of Verizon. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah, Hans, I think you hit on the key points there. We're always going to look at the pillars of our capital allocation policy. And right now, we continue to see a lot of opportunities to invest in our business. You see what we're doing there around the C-Band investment, for example, not just the spectrum, but also the CapEx associated with that. Obviously, we said long-term, we do believe deleveraging is the right priority. But we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders, and you saw that with the dividend. So Phil, you should expect us to continue to be thoughtful about capital allocation as we go forward.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Phil.\nPhil Cusick : Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Good morning. Thanks so much for the disclosure on fixed wireless. That's great to see. Perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on the economics of the product. Is this a similar ARPU to a smartphone? Are we looking at mostly LTE, or is this a mix of LTE and millimeter-wave? And then perhaps just coming back to the C-Band, I think you said before 7,000 to 8,000 towers this year, getting to 100 million covered POPs by the first quarter. Perhaps, if you just update us on that and then how quickly do you really turn that into an expansion of your fixed wireless footprint as the marketing really start coincident with that, or is that a steady ramp during the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Simon. On the fixed wireless access, yes, you're right, it's a similar ARPU on fixed wireless access as on our mobility. And also, when it comes to the numbers we have, as you said, it's a mix of 4G, it's millimeter wave in the fixed wires access right now. And as I said before, when we talk about our 5G fixed wireless access, the usage on the network is very similar as on Fios. They're even using more gigabytes on the fixed wireless access on 5G than they do on Fios. So -and we have a very, very good performance and quality. Remember, on the fixed wireless access, we are also doing, I would say, a different model with the self-install and all of that, making optionality for our customers. And ultimately, the vision is clear for Verizon. We're going to be a nationwide broadband provider. We're going to have different accesses in different places depending on what is right for the customers and how quickly we can deploy. So - and we are investing in the Fios. You saw the numbers this month. I mean, we're adding 130,000 in this quarter -- or 129,000 to be exact net adds in broadband. So this is a great business for us and we\u2019re just ramping fixed wireless access and then coming back to C-Band. As soon as we turn on C-Band, we're also going to augment the footprint that we can offer fixed wireless access. So -- and as we said in the opening remarks, we are on track for that to deliver of the one-year having a 100 million POPs covered by the C-Band. As I said, there are some challenges in supply chain. But I can only say the team is doing an enormous work. And just to be clear on it, the long-term planning we have with our vendors, the projection or forecasting we have done for all our equipment vendors over two years before we start deploying, of course, is paying off right now that we worked very differently with our vendors and how we plan. We have also pulled resources and inventory higher in the network, so we can easily see that we have access to it. So we have done a lot of things in the last two years, three years in supply chain, so we can be in a situation to mitigate challenge as we have right now. So all-in-all, that's where we are. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, Simon, I think Hans has summed it up well there. We've got good momentum in the fixed wireless business there. You saw the 55,000 net adds in the quarter. That means we're approximately 150,000 total subscribers on fixed wireless access at the end of the quarter, good momentum being built there. And as Hans said, as soon as we turn on C-Band, immediately be adding that to the technologies that we're selling on fixed wireless access. So good momentum buildup and then we've got that extra turbo booster come here in the next few weeks.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Many thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Brad, ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And just actually a follow-up here on your broadband business. You mentioned you're getting a mix of both LTE and 5G subscribers. I'm curious, who are these customers? Specifically, are you upselling into existing accounts or are these primarily new relationships for Verizon? And then, it's also notable that you are continuing to expand the Fios footprint. It looks like you're going to add over 400,000 locations open for sale this year and it seems like you would expect to be at or above that pace going forward. You really hadn't edged out that footprint for a long time. Why have you decided to do that now? How big could the Fios footprint be? And is all of this happening in your region, or are you actually doing some of this out of region? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. On the customers on fixed wireless access, I would say, they are probably roughly half and half. Half meaning coming from our existing base and half we\u2019re taking from other cost -- from other suppliers. That's basically how they're coming in right now. And let's see how the mix going forward. But here we have the optionality that we've talked about before and we have the owner's economics to work with convergence if that's what our customers want to have. We basically have all of those optionalities right now and I feel really good about that. And then the second question on the Fios footprint, we have constantly, of course, deployed Fios in this \u2013 in our ILEC to be honest. And what we see right now is very strong demand and we\u2019re winning the business. We're deploying -- the team is deploying, as I said, we're heading towards 400,000 open for sale this year and we will continue with that because we see a great demand and our win share is extremely strong in the Fios footprint.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So just a couple of things that are out there, Brett. On the mixture of the customers, as Hans mentioned, a good mix of 50-50 kind of split there between new and existing customers. But also our comment that a good mix -- a good split between not just it being in rural areas and so on, but also seeing good traction in suburban and urban areas, too, for those products. And when you think about those customers in the first 46 C-Band markets that will come online, that the customers taking the LTE product there are getting a router that also has C-Band in, so they could immediately step up to those speeds when - as soon as we turn C-Band on there soon. And the Fios expansion, it\u2019s - there's a couple of pieces. We see great opportunity, as Hans mentioned. The other pace it's a great cost opportunity as well, as we continue to upgrade the network technology in that footprint as well. So we've been investing in there for a number of years, maybe haven't spoken about it quite as much, but it continues to be a very good growth driver for the business. And we see very strong line of sight for it to continue to do so. 4.7% growth in Fios revenues this quarter, certainly something we can continue to build on.\nBrett Feldman: If you don't mind, as a quick follow-up there around the cost point. Those of us who live in regions that have Fios know that sometimes you can get Fios was maybe down the street. You can't -- are you kind of completing the communities? In other words, are you going to be at the point where you could finally rip out all this legacy infrastructure. Is that what you meant by the cost savings?\nMatthew Ellis: Right. That absolutely part of it. Now we're going to be all the way there, that's a long term goal for us, but certainly as you replace in a certain location, copper with fiber, there is a good benefit from a cost standpoint, in addition to the revenue step-up opportunities you get with that customer base. So it's a win-win on both sides of the P&L there.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. Just a couple follow-ups again on the C-Band deployment. First of all, are you seeing any supply chain or labor shortage issues with that that may affect the timing of that roll out? And then beyond that, thanks for the 15 million home passed with fixed wireless by year-end. Can you give us a sense of what the C-Band deployment -- the sort of first phase of that? What that will do to that number? As that gets launched, do you turn on a number of more homes? And then lastly, can you give us a sense of how your go-to-market strategy will change it? And do you expect the C-Band deployment to change the trajectory of your net adds, both on a fixed and mobile basis when we see that early next year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: On the C-Band, as I said before, there are, of course, challenges in supply chain. But our team has -- I think our team is the most outstanding operation excellence team in the world and they are getting around all of it. On all major equipment, radios, et cetera, that's already secured. This is in a warehouse and that's how we work. I mean, we do long-term planning. with our suppliers years back, so we feel really good about that. There has been some challenges to meet material. the team is working around them every day, finding new solutions in order for us to deploy and they will continue to do so. When it comes to resources, again, we secured our resources year of ahead to be prepared for these types of deployment we have. We are doing more deployment than we have ever done before. You talk about C-Band, we do mmWave 14,000 this year, we do fiber, we do orientations on the 4G, we do Fios, the team -- so it's many things they're doing, and we have never done more than this and I can tell you the team with supply chain and deployment are doing a great job. When it comes to them, 15 million households passed by year-end this year, that includes all the technologies we have. And of course, the second part that we guided for when we had our Investor Day is what to get the 50 million households path later on. So that includes all the technologies, including C-Band of course, and also how we deal with different types of devices, having all the different technology in them. So the team has been planning this, creating opportunities for us. And of course, without coming into 2022 yet, but the opening of the C-Band, we see great new opportunities. And as I said, also, in Investor Day, that means that we can accelerate and amplify our business case on 5G. That was the whole day thing with the C-Band, and the team is geared up for that and very focused.\nJohn Hodulik: That's great. Thanks a lot.\nMatthew Ellis: So just following up on the bit about the open, the households cover. As you saw in the prepared remarks, we're 11.6 million at the end of the third quarter. Obviously, we'll continue to add some millimeter-wave and 4G for the rest of the year, but C-Band certainly will get us well over to 50 million as we turn that on.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, John. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to return Hans to the competitive landscape. I guess, year-over-year, I think most observers would say that the promotions kind of look very similar as they did a year ago. And if anything, the wireless landscape's probably less competitive now than it's ever been in terms of postpaid phone net add availability. And as we look ahead, I think the things that people wonder about what's going to change as the EBP, and the TPP, and the renovated programs all go away, the super-normal kind of sport for the postpaid market might ebb. And second, you've got the cable companies coming in with new pricing plans. And then third, we've got the dish launch coming up. Could you kind of give us your perspective on how comfortable people should be about how the landscape is going to evolve as these things change? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. A lot of moving parts there as you talk about. Again, I mean, I think that what we have -- and now, we start with consumer because remember also our strong position, wireless on the business side and basically we are leading in every segment, so sometimes we forget to talk about our strong areas. But let me start with consumer because I think your question is a little bit more geared to consumer. Remember how we have built our [Indiscernible]. First of all, we have the best network, we have kept the best network. We've augmented and we are, of course, adding more spectrum to it right now with C-Band, so that's very important. The second part is that the value we're doing besides having the best network, of course, with all the offerings we have created over time with Discovery, Disney Plus, which all of them are giving us profitability and retention. And you see the share numbers in this quarter. I think we have found the model with Mix and Match, and if things that we are offering our customers on the wireless side has really paid off with both the loyalty, but also the step-ups. And remember, when Matt talked about that's where I'm now, 1/3 of all the unlimited beyond unlimited premium. But we still have, let's say, 1/3 omitted plan as well. So we have so many steps to continue to move our customers upwards. And that has been a strategy from beginning, and it's clearly different than anybody else in the market, how we can do that. Both offered the best network and the experiences that we have, as well as the Mix and Match that we have in the network. So I feel good about the -- regardless of what type of competition is there and how it changes. We have owner's economics of everything we're doing, that was very clear from the beginning, we'll bring our own fiber, we have the full network and that's why we can have ebbs -- and windows on the network, which will also are benefiting from. So the whole idea with the strategy we laid out is just playing straight into what's happening in the market where mobility and broadband is the essential infrastructure for every individual in the world at the moment. And hey, everybody wants to be here. We have the best assets. That's basically how it looks.\nMatthew Ellis: There are a couple of other points, Dave, if I can. So you mentioned the EBBP impact on the marketplace and certainly, we're supportive of all efforts to make digital connectivity available and accessible to everyone in the country and we're participating in those programs. I would though say that in terms of our gross adds and new customers coming in, it's a very small portion of that. The majority of our EBBP participation is with existing customers rather than new customers. So it's not a driver of gross adds for us. And you also mentioned that obviously in the marketplace, there's been new plans that have come to the market in the past 6 months to 9 months. And what I would say is just look at the volumes we've had, especially in the last 2 quarters. Even with those new plans in place, you see the high-quality volumes that we've put on in that environment. So you have to look across both the service revenue and the handset components of the offering to customers. You add in the other values into products and services that we bring to customers too. This is the strategy we've been working on for 2 years to 3 years now. Obviously, it was a bit of a dip when we hit the pandemic, but the strategy was driving revenue growth before the pandemic and you see it driving revenue growth now as we continue to focus on high quality customers and increasing the value of our base, and it shows in the results.\nDavid Barden: And if I could just quick follow-up, Matt. As we look at the implied performance in business wireline, is a portion of that related to Verizon's willingness to be more aggressive on price and throw more elbows to hang onto customers knowing that those enterprise relationships are the groundwork for potential new wireless relationships as we think about enterprise 5G?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. No, I think there's a couple of items when you look at the wireline part of business revenue results for the quarter that are not related to what you mentioned. One, last year during COVID, we saw a little bit of a step-up in some of the cold voice data revenue that we hadn't seen in quite a while. We're now lapping that and those volumes are returning to their pre -pandemic trends. The other thing is we've stepped out of some of the wholesale international voice business that had revenue, but not significant margins associated with it. So we wanted to focus on value driving activities. We continue to compete effectively in the enterprise space in wire life. But on the quality and reliability of the service we provide, obviously we aim to be competitive there, but I'm not seeing us do anything out of the ordinary of what we were doing previously. And as you mentioned, those relationships are very important to us as we go into the 5G era and we've already seen those relationships payoff with the work being done, working through those opportunities in [Indiscernible] with a broad array of enterprise customers.\nDavid Barden: Great. Thank you, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Dave. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, I'm curious if you're seeing any impact s of the inflation on your cost structure and related to that, what are the opportunities and the specific products where Verizon could try to pass through any increase in input cost and get better pricing? Second question, just taking the reaffirmation today that Verizon wants to be a national broadband provider for homes, businesses, and on-the-go, how are you evaluating that build-versus-buy decision of using your spectrum in 5G technology to introduce to fixed wireless broadband services versus the possibility of acquiring cable and fiber assets in the future?\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the second question, Michael, as on the inflation. When it comes to our rollout on nationwide broadband and playing with that, of course, remember, we are doing a lot for fiber already right now. We're doing -- Remember, we have been reporting on our One Fiber project, which is still ongoing in the most metropolitan area we're building fiber and of course, that is setting us up to have it all this economics on the broadband and then at the access point, we will do a different type of 4G access. That's what new -- the reason we do that because there's so much after when it comes to coming out to the customer, and we want to be innovate as well and having a self-install and all of that combined with it. That we're always on our fiber when comes on the outside our island, we have looked into buy versus build all the time. We have come to the conclusion we want to build, we built our own fiber network because we want the owner's economics on fiber so that work is already done. So we feel really good about it. We're going to have wireless economic nationwide on broadband over time here. And we can work with our wireless offering, our broadband offering. We, we created the two go-to-market Verizon Consumer and Business Group thinking about our customers, how they do products, how to do platforms, the user experience. This all comes into play right now and I couldn't be more excited on that right now because the momentum for mobility and broadband is happening. We have prepared and worked now for 3 years to get where we are and we -- I feel really good about what we have and the strategy is really working. Look at the last couple of quarters here when we talk about our net additions, talk about the revenue growth. And as I also said, when we spoke earlier, I mean if you look at the second quarter when everybody has reported, we also take the largest share of industry service and all revenue growth in the market. I mean, that's really what we're focusing on. We're focusing on getting the revenue growth. And that's a little bit of the answer to your question on inflation as well that Matt is going to soon take over, of course. We still have a lot on the wireless side where we can migrate customers up to higher plans, and that's of course the best way to see that we are getting incremental revenues from our customers, but also give them more value and experiences.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. Mike, certainly, we are seeing inflation in our business here. How long that lasts, obviously, we're going to have to wait and see and we're all monitoring that closely. But we're seeing that come across certainly in labor rates, we're seeing in commodities, driving utilities and whatnot. So -- but that's why the things we've done on the cost side over the past few years and continue to do are so important because it gives us the opportunity to be able to handle those -- any of those prices coming in and continue to produce good margins. So we will continue to be focused there. And then as Hans said, our opportunity on the pricing side is really to step customers up. If you've got direct cost out there that we can pass through that we certainly will always look for the opportunity to do that. That's why you see the changes in our content model from the legacy linear model, where there wasn't clear transparency to the consumer between the increase in the cost from the producer there to what they were paying. What you've seen, what we're doing in the wireless space with content, gives a lot more transparency. So as costs go up, it's much easier for those to flow through to the end-user.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Mike. Brad, we're for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First, you're starting to talk more about access. They disclosed more on fixed wireless, which we appreciate, but you've also talked about the other 5G growth applicant being Mobile Edge Computer, MEC. When will we start to see that show up in the numbers and actually start positively contributing to growth and where -- what line items would you point to where we will be able to see that? And then secondly, Hans, you mentioned that next quarter we should expect to see 2022 guidance. Just curious if your views on the metrics that you're focusing on might change, you're going to be seeing incremental headwinds, particularly the EPS, tied to some accounting. I believe on the spectrum. Just curious if you believe guiding to EBITDA and or free cash flow is something that might become more important when we see that guidance for next year. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Great question, Colby. First, on Mobile Edge Computer, first of all, we're doing a great progress in Mobile Edge Computer and you've seen that we're made announcements in the quarter with the biggest cloud providers in the market, both on the private 5G Mobile Edge Computer. And as you remember, there are basically 3 use cases. One, is the public Mobile Edge Computer, and then it's a private Mobile Edge Computer, and then it's private 5G networks. All of them are in execution right now. We're working with customers. We have announced a couple of commercial contracts already, like coordinating the British fort, etc. So that's already happening. And, And of course it takes some time because we are actually creating a total new market, and we're actually alone in this market. Nobody else in the world has launched mobile edge compute at this moment. So of course, we feel really good about that. And the team is working through the funnel all the way from proof of context to new applications. And that's how it works, when you create new markets, etc. So we will come back as soon as we feel it's time to start reporting it as we're have done with five-weeks fixed wireless access, but even more excited or the Mobile Edge Computer what I've seen the last year here with the technology solutions we have, and also the customer interaction we have together with the main partners. I mean, we have the biggest partners you can ever think about in this that are equally much invested as us, because that was part of the strategy to bring different parties. We have there, so we will continue with that. And we will come back and report, and we will give you new deals and how all this is progressing with partners over time and ultimately, of course, it's going to be financials and that's going to show up. Initially, of course, it's going to be on Verizon Business Group that's going to have that as revenue. The rest would be to see opportunity longer term, which can end up in consumer but predominantly in the beginning is a Verizon business group opportunity. Matt on guidance, have you thought through what you're going to do next year? He hasn't told me yet.\nMatthew Ellis: Colby, great question. So obviously we'll get into guidance at the next call. But as you mentioned, we always look at what year-over-year pressures maybe in there, especially things that are accounting-related rather than cash flow-related. We'll make sure we have the appropriate level of transparency around that. The important thing for us to be out there demonstrating that guidance is how our strategy is working and it's going to show up in revenue growth and cash flow growth. And you see that this year we'll find a way to make sure that we can communicate clearly that we're continuing to grow the top-line of the business and it's flowing through into the cash generation of the business as well, which is ultimately what it's all about.\nBrady Connor: Great.\nColby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Colby. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. Two questions, if I could, both sort of at a strategic level, Hans. First, maybe you could just update us on your expectations for -- what exactly do you do differently when you get the TracFone asset? How do you think about the go-to-market strategy in the prepaid market in particular? And then second, you've started to see some of the whether it's Opensignal or other reports suggesting that T-Mobile's network for 5G is faster and broader coverage. How do you think about maintaining the best network advantage that you've had? And what gives you confidence that you can convey that in the business and consumer markets?\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the second one. First of all, we rely on the RootMetrics because that's the most sophisticated and scientific way of measuring the network, and it's -- we're undoubtedly the leader there. And without going into my competition because I never talk about them, but clearly one is always lost. So if we're done talking about TracFone, which is of course an exciting opportunity for us, which is still to be closed. We're not -- we don't have the go-to-market and the brands that TracFone have. They are so good on prepaid, and they've showed that. But at we will, of course, support them with these all the back-end support, all the way from supply chain, IT support, UX customer care, and all of that. But clearly, we want to keep the points of sales. We want to keep the offerings, and we want to serve the value market. That's where we are. I cannot go further into that because we still have the pending approval of it, but we will give you even more color, Craig, as soon as we have closed this one.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Craig. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Maybe a longer-term question. When we look at your growth algorithm on the consumer side, You have essentially an ARPU -- an upper growth trend line as well as revenue trend-lining, which is trailing [Indiscernible]. Probably continue as you deploy C-Band. And then as your [Indiscernible] increases, G&A should also pick up as we head into next year. And then there is the competitive backdrop which potentially capture [Indiscernible]. When you think about this growth algorithm, how do you keep margins impact when your revenue growth is essentially trailing?\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Can -- you broke up there but I think what you were trying to ask is how do we think about margin profile as ARPA trails the service revenue growth? Matt, your thoughts?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So work in our team, we have tremendous opportunities and you see it come through in the results we've delivered now for a few quarters. So the ability to bring high quality customers in and then step them up. So the step-ups give us the increase in ARPA. And then the service revenue is obviously a combination of the increase in revenue within the base. And then also the impact of the new customers coming in. So as you do that, we're very, very confident that you continue to add scale to our business, which is already the best-in-class from a scale standpoint and that will show up in the margin profile of the business going forward. So I expect us to continue to have a very strong margin profile going forward. It's built on executing the strategy. You see that in the results this year. You compare the consumer margin in 3Q this year to two years ago, you see that strategy is working and delivering results at both of the top-line and the margin line.\nBrady Connor: Perfect. Yes.\nKannan Venkateshwar: [Indiscernible]\nBrady Connor: Kanaan, we're having technical difficulties with you. We'll have to catch up later. Thanks.\nKannan Venkateshwar: No problem.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Brad, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Can you give us a little more color you mentioned there was a split in the fixed wireless, the team, the consumer and business. How is that shaking out? And then on the business side, it's still a little bit weaker there. Is that just continued pricing pressure in the market or is it a share issue or walk us through how you're looking at the enterprise space going forward.\nHans Vestberg: I talked about the fixed wireless access on the business side. It's called BCC Internet on that signed offering we have. And of course, we started off with our fixed wireless access on the consumer side, and we later on added in our business to actually have access to it. That's why because that's what we want to restart. I wouldn't say we have really good traction on the business side on fixed wireless actions, small and medium businesses. clearly where we have our stronghold, and we're being the clear leader. So we see this as a great opportunity for our Verizon Business Group as well. And again, we are now adding products and solution for Verizon Business Group that over time should offset the wireline decline that we have that Matt talked about. When we talk about the Verizon Business Group, I haven't talked enough about them, but the momentum on wireless there is really good. Look at it, small and medium business are coming back. They're doing a great job. On the enterprise side, the wireless business is doing well as well. The only area is the public sector that's coming a little bit back, but that's a very natural thing because the increased demand of home education and etc. During the COVID, of course, had a spike in wireless connections, which you see is naturally coming down a little bit right now. But the momentum on the wireless side, on the Verizon Business Group, and then you add the new opportunities, everything from application on top of the network, the Mobile Edge Computer, the fixed wireless access. And over time, more so opportunities outside the ILEC on vials, or at least on fiber. So that's a great opportunity for us, and that's what we outlined already in 2019 when we decided to transform that business to see that we are really well prepared for capturing those opportunities and those transformations that all the enterprise will need and companies will do to digitalize over time. So I think we're in a good place. [Indiscernible] team are doing a great job.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Frank. That's all the time we have today for questions. Thanks for joining the call and everybody be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered strong financial and operating performance. As we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth as a goal in itself, but on high-value volume growth that will yield sustainable increases in revenue and profitability going forward. By delivering the best-in-class network experiences to customers with additional services and products like Disney+ that others can't provide, our strategy is focused on increasing the value we received from every connection. As you can see from our results, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. In the third quarter, consolidated total revenue was $32.9 billion, up 4.3% from prior year. Our results are inclusive of two months of Media revenue, which approximated $1.4 billion on a segment basis. Excluding Verizon Media, total revenue grew 5.5%. Our service and other revenue growth rate was 0.5% and 1.6% without Verizon Media. Equipment revenue growth was approximately 30% compared to the prior year, mainly due to the timing of iconic device launches and the continued pandemic recovery. Fios revenue was 3.2 billion up 4.7% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in customers, as well as our efforts to increase the value of each customer by encouraging them to step up in speed tiers. Total wireless service revenue, which is the sum of consumer and business, was $17.1 billion, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year. The results were driven by higher access revenue, volume growth, and products. We are creating more paths to growth with connectivity and non-connectivity services. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $12.3 billion up 3.3% from prior year. Top-line growth and a reduction in non-equipment related expenses contributed to the year-over-year EBITDA growth. And that EBITDA growth is helping us drive EPS growth. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was a $1.41, up year-over-year by 12.8%. Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on bringing in high-quality net adds, a key component in helping us continue to deliver strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. We are seeing strong demand for connectivity across our consumer and business units. Our Mix and Match value propositions, network quality, and unique partnerships are resonating with both new and existing customers. For the quarter, we delivered 429,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds. up more than 50% from prior year and in line with 2019 levels. We're seeing growth in new accounts, as well as high retention levels, allowing us to grow our base with high-quality net adds, phone churn for the quarter was 0.74%, well below pre -pandemic levels. Churn continues to benefit from a number of sustainable factors, including our best-in-class network with unmatched reliability and coverage and overall value propositions within our consumer and business unlimited plans. Additionally, consumer payment patterns continue to be better than pre -pandemic norms. Total broadband net adds, defined here as Fios, DSL, and fixed wireless; were 129,000. Fios Internet net add were 104,000 compared to 144,000 last year. As a reminder, last year's 3Q Fios results included a benefit from a higher backlog entering the quarter, as we had largely paused installs in Q2 2020 due to COVID. Fios has continued momentum driven by our best-in-class value proposition, built on network quality, and our Mix and Match pricing structure. This combination is helping us to take share and deliver historically low churn rates. For the first time we're providing fixed wireless net adds, which include both consumer and business fixed wireless products. We are building momentum and our pre C-Band success in Q3 demonstrates there is demand for the product from consumers and businesses. Both our 5G and LTE fixed wireless products are performing very well. We're pleased with what we're seeing around the install process, as well as the quality and reliability of the product. Now, let's turn to our Consumer Group results. Our Consumer Group had another strong quarter, continuing the momentum that we've been seeing in wireless and Fios. Total revenue was $23.3 billion up 7.3% year-over-year. Service and other revenue was $18.8 billion, an improvement of 2.5% versus prior year. These results include strong wireless revenue, as well as growth in Fios. Fios revenue was $2.9 billion, up 4.3% year-over-year mainly driven by growth in our Internet base of approximately 400,000 or 6.2% over the past year and migration to higher speed. Our actions around Mix and Match, which include a broadband first approach is helping us to grow with Fios revenue and Consumer EBITDA. We still see plenty of room for additional growth within Fios as we continue to increase our share Mix and Match penetration rates and are open for sale locations. Wireless service revenue is $14 billion up 4% from the prior year. We have been driving access gains both in growing accounts and phone net ad, as well as by continuing to execute on our migration strategy. As a result of migrations and step-ups, over 30% of our account base is now on premium unlimited plans. Our growth in access is being complemented by product revenue, which includes items such as protection plans, content, and others. Our wide range of product offerings helps us to not only grow revenue, but provides differentiated experiences and more value to our customers. For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year or more than $200 million, driven by our high quality service and other revenue gains coming from multiple growth vectors. These results show the impact of our strategy to enhance the value of each connection, which we believe will drive continued growth into the future. The Mix and Match pricing structure for both wireless and Fios provides tremendous opportunity to migrate customers to higher-value tiers and bringing customers and higher value plans. We're very pleased with how this strategy is working to help us increase value from our base and from new customers. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout our results. Postpaid phone net adds were 267,000 above our Q3 performance in 2019 and 2020. the performance was consistent during the period, as we are able to grow accounts and deliver sustainably low churns throughout the quarter. Most importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the quality of customers we're adding. With approximately 66% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan. And Q3 was another quarter in which we saw a strong acceleration in our 5G penetration, exiting the quarter with over 25% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device, which is great progress in advance of our launch of 5G service from C-Band spectrum in the coming months. Fios Internet net adds were 98,000 for the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing, especially on retention. Now, let's move to Slide 11 to review the business group results. Our business segment continues to see strong demand for wireless services across multiple verticals. We are continuing to focus on what we believe will be the highest growth portions of the business segment, our small and medium business unit, private wireless, and the Mix space or enterprise customers, as well as building momentum for fixed wireless access to serve multiple customer groups. Total revenues for the business segment was $7.7 billion. We continue to see growth in wireless revenue being offset by ongoing legacy wireline declines. Wireless service revenue was $3.1 billion up 3.6% year-over-year. We saw quarter-over-quarter expansion driven by small and medium business, which was partially offset by distance learning prices in public sector. Wireline revenues continue to be pressured by secular trends, while also facing elevated year-over-year comps due to 2020 COVID spending. Consistent with our focus on driving high-value business, in the wholesale space we continue to rationalize our international voice traffic which is contributing to the revenue decline shown on the slide. Business segment EBITDA was $1.9 billion, down 2.4% from the same quarter last year, and business segment EBITDA margin was 24.8% in the quarter. While secular trends within wireline will continue to put pressure on margins in the near-term, we're encouraged by the growth opportunities associated with our business transformation efforts as they start to gain traction. Our market leadership in wireless across all customer groups and our continued investment in primary growth areas for Verizon Business Group will position us to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the future. We are encouraged by the results we delivered for the highest value portions of the segments in 3Q. Phone gross add volumes were above pre -pandemic levels, up 11.4% year-over-year and up 3% versus the same quarter in 2019. Total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 276,000. To better highlight some of the trends, on the slide we've broken out the net adds by public sector, and our higher-growth commercial businesses, which includes small and medium business and enterprise. During 3Q 2020, the commercial space primarily within small and medium business was suppressed. While public sector, buoyed by distance learning programs saw elevated net adds. In 3Q '21, we've seen a rebound in the commercial space, while distance learning disconnects have driven public sector volumes to lower levels. We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter. A portion of distance learning disconnects also impacted our phone churn and net add performance. Despite this, we delivered postpaid phone net adds of a 162,000. Now, let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $31.2 billion. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by lower cash taxes last year from a onetime benefit and higher working capital requirements this year due to greater volumes. Year-to-date capital spending totaled $13.9 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the rates and capacity of our 5G ultra wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $1 billion through the third quarter, and we have placed orders for approximately $2 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously guided incremental CapEx range of two to $3 billion for the year as we accelerate our C-Band deployment. The net results to cash flow from operations and capital spending is $17.3 billion of free cash flow for the 9-month period. Net unsecured debt at quarter-end was a $131.6 billion, a $5.2 billion decrease versus the prior quarter. In addition to our third green bond issuance, we extended over $4.6 billion of near-term debt into a new 2032 maturity. As we continue to optimize borrowing costs and our debt profile, our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.7 times. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $9.9 billion, which included the proceeds associated with our sale of Verizon Media Group. We expect lower levels of cash on hand as we progress through the fourth quarter and approach the close of the TracFone acquisition while continuing to execute on our business strategy within our capital allocation framework. Let's move onto Slide 14 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. We continued our strong first-half performance momentum in the third quarter. Hans and I are very pleased with the hard work our team is putting forth. And we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we prepare for the C-Band launch. Our strong year-to-date results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter are allowing us to update guidance on both wireless service revenue growth, and EPS. Wireless service revenue growth is now expected to be around 4.0%, the higher end of the prior guidance. Adjusted EPS guidance is being increased to $5.35 to $5.40 up from the prior range of 525 to 535. Our guidance for the effective tax rate is unchanged. CapEx guidance is also unchanged. Though I'd note that our assumption for our BAU spend of $17.5 to $18.5 billion is dependent upon no material changes in the current state of our supply chain. Our team continues to execute on our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results. We are attracting high-quality customers that see value in our products and services, evidenced by growth in accounts, migrations, and step-ups. I look forward to continued momentum as we wrap up the year and position our base to take full advantage of all the things 5G Built Right has to offer. With that, I will hand it over to Hans to wrap up our prepared remarks. Yeah, Hans, I think you hit on the key points there. We're always going to look at the pillars of our capital allocation policy. And right now, we continue to see a lot of opportunities to invest in our business. You see what we're doing there around the C-Band investment, for example, not just the spectrum, but also the CapEx associated with that. Obviously, we said long-term, we do believe deleveraging is the right priority. But we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders, and you saw that with the dividend. So Phil, you should expect us to continue to be thoughtful about capital allocation as we go forward. Yes, Simon, I think Hans has summed it up well there. We've got good momentum in the fixed wireless business there. You saw the 55,000 net adds in the quarter. That means we're approximately 150,000 total subscribers on fixed wireless access at the end of the quarter, good momentum being built there. And as Hans said, as soon as we turn on C-Band, immediately be adding that to the technologies that we're selling on fixed wireless access. So good momentum buildup and then we've got that extra turbo booster come here in the next few weeks. Yes. So just a couple of things that are out there, Brett. On the mixture of the customers, as Hans mentioned, a good mix of 50-50 kind of split there between new and existing customers. But also our comment that a good mix -- a good split between not just it being in rural areas and so on, but also seeing good traction in suburban and urban areas, too, for those products. And when you think about those customers in the first 46 C-Band markets that will come online, that the customers taking the LTE product there are getting a router that also has C-Band in, so they could immediately step up to those speeds when - as soon as we turn C-Band on there soon. And the Fios expansion, it's - there's a couple of pieces. We see great opportunity, as Hans mentioned. The other pace it's a great cost opportunity as well, as we continue to upgrade the network technology in that footprint as well. So we've been investing in there for a number of years, maybe haven't spoken about it quite as much, but it continues to be a very good growth driver for the business. And we see very strong line of sight for it to continue to do so. 4.7% growth in Fios revenues this quarter, certainly something we can continue to build on. Right. That absolutely part of it. Now we're going to be all the way there, that's a long term goal for us, but certainly as you replace in a certain location, copper with fiber, there is a good benefit from a cost standpoint, in addition to the revenue step-up opportunities you get with that customer base. So it's a win-win on both sides of the P&L there. So just following up on the bit about the open, the households cover. As you saw in the prepared remarks, we're 11.6 million at the end of the third quarter. Obviously, we'll continue to add some millimeter-wave and 4G for the rest of the year, but C-Band certainly will get us well over to 50 million as we turn that on. There are a couple of other points, Dave, if I can. So you mentioned the EBBP impact on the marketplace and certainly, we're supportive of all efforts to make digital connectivity available and accessible to everyone in the country and we're participating in those programs. I would though say that in terms of our gross adds and new customers coming in, it's a very small portion of that. The majority of our EBBP participation is with existing customers rather than new customers. So it's not a driver of gross adds for us. And you also mentioned that obviously in the marketplace, there's been new plans that have come to the market in the past 6 months to 9 months. And what I would say is just look at the volumes we've had, especially in the last 2 quarters. Even with those new plans in place, you see the high-quality volumes that we've put on in that environment. So you have to look across both the service revenue and the handset components of the offering to customers. You add in the other values into products and services that we bring to customers too. This is the strategy we've been working on for 2 years to 3 years now. Obviously, it was a bit of a dip when we hit the pandemic, but the strategy was driving revenue growth before the pandemic and you see it driving revenue growth now as we continue to focus on high quality customers and increasing the value of our base, and it shows in the results. Yeah. No, I think there's a couple of items when you look at the wireline part of business revenue results for the quarter that are not related to what you mentioned. One, last year during COVID, we saw a little bit of a step-up in some of the cold voice data revenue that we hadn't seen in quite a while. We're now lapping that and those volumes are returning to their pre -pandemic trends. The other thing is we've stepped out of some of the wholesale international voice business that had revenue, but not significant margins associated with it. So we wanted to focus on value driving activities. We continue to compete effectively in the enterprise space in wire life. But on the quality and reliability of the service we provide, obviously we aim to be competitive there, but I'm not seeing us do anything out of the ordinary of what we were doing previously. And as you mentioned, those relationships are very important to us as we go into the 5G era and we've already seen those relationships payoff with the work being done, working through those opportunities in [Indiscernible] with a broad array of enterprise customers. Yes. Thanks, Hans. Mike, certainly, we are seeing inflation in our business here. How long that lasts, obviously, we're going to have to wait and see and we're all monitoring that closely. But we're seeing that come across certainly in labor rates, we're seeing in commodities, driving utilities and whatnot. So -- but that's why the things we've done on the cost side over the past few years and continue to do are so important because it gives us the opportunity to be able to handle those -- any of those prices coming in and continue to produce good margins. So we will continue to be focused there. And then as Hans said, our opportunity on the pricing side is really to step customers up. If you've got direct cost out there that we can pass through that we certainly will always look for the opportunity to do that. That's why you see the changes in our content model from the legacy linear model, where there wasn't clear transparency to the consumer between the increase in the cost from the producer there to what they were paying. What you've seen, what we're doing in the wireless space with content, gives a lot more transparency. So as costs go up, it's much easier for those to flow through to the end-user. Colby, great question. So obviously we'll get into guidance at the next call. But as you mentioned, we always look at what year-over-year pressures maybe in there, especially things that are accounting-related rather than cash flow-related. We'll make sure we have the appropriate level of transparency around that. The important thing for us to be out there demonstrating that guidance is how our strategy is working and it's going to show up in revenue growth and cash flow growth. And you see that this year we'll find a way to make sure that we can communicate clearly that we're continuing to grow the top-line of the business and it's flowing through into the cash generation of the business as well, which is ultimately what it's all about. Yes. So work in our team, we have tremendous opportunities and you see it come through in the results we've delivered now for a few quarters. So the ability to bring high quality customers in and then step them up. So the step-ups give us the increase in ARPA. And then the service revenue is obviously a combination of the increase in revenue within the base. And then also the impact of the new customers coming in. So as you do that, we're very, very confident that you continue to add scale to our business, which is already the best-in-class from a scale standpoint and that will show up in the margin profile of the business going forward. So I expect us to continue to have a very strong margin profile going forward. It's built on executing the strategy. You see that in the results this year. You compare the consumer margin in 3Q this year to two years ago, you see that strategy is working and delivering results at both of the top-line and the margin line."

            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. We had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth. This was supported by strong net additions in wireless and broadband, which are both translated to bottom line growth. This definitely confirms our strategy to grow our business with high quality offerings. As I've said throughout the year, we have all the assets we need to extend our number one position in the market. Our strategy remains unchanged and we're delivering on everything we promised, and we're gaining momentum on all of five vectors of growth. We have more paths to grow than anybody else and we're confident with our growth targets throughout the years based on our third quarter and continued momentum into the fourth quarter. As an evidence, we're updating financial guidance for the full year. We now expect total wireless service revenue growth of around 4%, which is on the high-end of our prior guidance, and adjusted EPS of $5.35 to $5.40, up from $5.25 to $5.35. We remain on track to achieve our targeted CapEx levels in 2021, assuming no further disruption in the supply chain. Our team is working diligently and doing a fantastic work with vendors and suppliers to ensure we have adequate equipment to meet our C-Band build and that we have devices that are customer want. Our operational excellence and our partnership strategy is the best in the industry, which I've been so impressed by since I joined Verizon. And in times like this, it matters. Let's talk about business. We continue to provide the best-in-class experience across the board. On the network front, third parties continue to recognize us as the best network experience. These includes RootMetrics for the 16th consecutive time and J.D. Power for the 27th consecutive time. Our network team is doing a great job. On the commercial front, we've got great momentum into five-year adoption, with over 25% of our consumer phone base using a 5G-capable device. This is tracking well ahead of the 4G adoption, as I've said before. For context, 12 months of the 4G launched, 10% of the devices were in 4G. Less than 12 months after 5G DSS launched, more than the double were on 5G devices and it's growing at a rapid pace. These combined with our millimeter-wave strategy is an important combination and that is paying off. In the third quarter, the total millimeter wave uses more than double sequentially. We're doing more gigabit of usage in a month now than we did in all the first quarter. In some or more established build-outs, we're seeing more than 20% of usage on millimeter wave. And we're on track to have 5% to 10% of all traffic in the urban millimeter wave polygons by year-end. For Business segment, we continue to add wireless subscribers and take broadband share in our ILEC footprint with Fios. And finally, we delivered significant value creation and strategy refinement with a sale of the Verizon Media Group in September, depending TracFone acquisition and also the issuance of our third green bond, which is a vital step towards our net zero goal in 2035. All this was accomplish in tandem with a strong quarter results. When it comes to the financials, we're on track to meet and exceed all of our 2021 guidance. We expect to have a strong finish of the year as we approach the launch of C-Band. We continue to deliver excellent revenue performance in wireless service and within Fios. We have a diversified path for revenue growth with all five vectors contributing. EBITDA was up 3.3% year-over-year. And on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 12.8%. Our capital allocation stands firm. We invest in our business to create shareholder value. We continue to increase our dividend, which we did for the 15 consecutive year. And Matt and team are working diligently on our debt reduction. As we said last quarter, our guidance race is broad-based and across all our five vectors of growth. Consumer segment EBITDA increased by 2%, driven by positive trends in customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services, and content, as well as prepaid and reseller growth. The service revenue momentum in the third quarter was driven by continued execution of our migration strategy to higher-valued price plans, as well as high-quality net adds. But our growth is more than that. Much of our long-term growth is in fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute. Our strategy is becoming a national broadband provider with the best access to the tech for our customers includes Fios, fixed wireless access on 5G, 4G millimeter-wave and C-Band. When it comes to the mobile edge compute, we are the mobile edge compute leader, both in public and private. Thanks for great partnerships. And we just announced a private mobile edge compute partnership with Amazon that we're pleased with. And this just scratches the surface on how we will continue to utilize our assets. We're confident in our growth opportunities as we move into the investment cycle with C-Band. Before I hand it over to Matt, I want to briefly touch on our broadband expansion. We're on track to meet our fixed wireless access household coverage targets with an expected 15 million homes passed by the end of the year between 4G and 5G. To date, five-year home is in 57 markets and the 4G LTE home in over 200 markets across all 50 states. In addition to fixed wireless access, we're pleased with the great performance or Fios and continue to grow the open for sales volumes within our footprint. We're on track on exceeding all the commitments for 2021 and on track for long-term growth expectations outlined in our Investor Day earlier this year. You can expect us to provide 2022 guidance during our Q4 21 earnings call. And now, Matt, over to you. Thank you, Matt. As you heard, we delivered a solid third quarter results and we are on track to meet or exceed all our 2021 commitments to the investment community. Our strategy is working and I'm confident in the strategy we have to deliver both strong results and premium experiences going forward. As we look ahead, we continue to focus on expanding our 5G leadership, capitalizing on wireless momentum and work towards our C-Band launch, deploying differentiating experiences for our customers, and execute our network as a service to actually deliver all 5 vectors of growth, and we look forward to delivering on all fronts and sharing our results in the coming months. With that, I hand it back to Brady. Thank you, Phil. Let me start with the competitive landscape. Yes, there is, of course, a little bit more competitive landscape right now, but let me remind you on a couple of things. First of all, as we have learned from the history, I mean, broadband and mobility is two of the most important infrastructure for any person in this country and in the world. So it's not strange that there is competition. Secondly, we're in a moment where 5G scaling, the economy is strong, so of course that's a moment where we see a lot of competition. But anyhow, if you look at our numbers, we are competing extremely effectively. We are gaining the high-quality customers regardless all the type of competition we have. Not only that, the money if you look at our growth of 3.9%, we feel really good about that as well. That won't come to our service revenue. And we have been going back and forth on our promos. And the reason is that Roman and his team on the consumer side, they look at long-term profitability, high-quality customers when they come in and doing a promo. And right now we feel very good about how we compete in the market. So we're always going to have promos when we think is the right timing of it. So we feel really good about it. And as we also saw that Matt talked about our increased guidance as well. So all in all, we feel good how we compete in this environment. And if you look at the track record, the last couple of quarter has been really strong in consumer and Ronan and the whole team are doing a great job, so I feel good about that. When it comes to the capital allocation, I'll let -- I can just say that we -- our capital allocation is clear. I mean, we focus number one, on investing in business and we are investing in the business this year and both in CapEx, the spectrum and all of that, so that's number one. But we also have, as I said, I mean, our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase and Matt and I, we constantly see that we have a position for the board, so they can continue to do that and we will continue to do that. And then we have our debt reduction, which Matt will talk about. And finally, we have buybacks that we can do all the time. What I can tell you is that we are going to have a conversation with the Board, which is the best way of doing capital allocation, the priorities and we'll continue to do so to see that our shareholders get the best out of Verizon. Matt? Thank you, Simon. On the fixed wireless access, yes, you're right, it's a similar ARPU on fixed wireless access as on our mobility. And also, when it comes to the numbers we have, as you said, it's a mix of 4G, it's millimeter wave in the fixed wires access right now. And as I said before, when we talk about our 5G fixed wireless access, the usage on the network is very similar as on Fios. They're even using more gigabytes on the fixed wireless access on 5G than they do on Fios. So -and we have a very, very good performance and quality. Remember, on the fixed wireless access, we are also doing, I would say, a different model with the self-install and all of that, making optionality for our customers. And ultimately, the vision is clear for Verizon. We're going to be a nationwide broadband provider. We're going to have different accesses in different places depending on what is right for the customers and how quickly we can deploy. So - and we are investing in the Fios. You saw the numbers this month. I mean, we're adding 130,000 in this quarter -- or 129,000 to be exact net adds in broadband. So this is a great business for us and we're just ramping fixed wireless access and then coming back to C-Band. As soon as we turn on C-Band, we're also going to augment the footprint that we can offer fixed wireless access. So -- and as we said in the opening remarks, we are on track for that to deliver of the one-year having a 100 million POPs covered by the C-Band. As I said, there are some challenges in supply chain. But I can only say the team is doing an enormous work. And just to be clear on it, the long-term planning we have with our vendors, the projection or forecasting we have done for all our equipment vendors over two years before we start deploying, of course, is paying off right now that we worked very differently with our vendors and how we plan. We have also pulled resources and inventory higher in the network, so we can easily see that we have access to it. So we have done a lot of things in the last two years, three years in supply chain, so we can be in a situation to mitigate challenge as we have right now. So all-in-all, that's where we are. Matt? Okay. On the customers on fixed wireless access, I would say, they are probably roughly half and half. Half meaning coming from our existing base and half we're taking from other cost -- from other suppliers. That's basically how they're coming in right now. And let's see how the mix going forward. But here we have the optionality that we've talked about before and we have the owner's economics to work with convergence if that's what our customers want to have. We basically have all of those optionalities right now and I feel really good about that. And then the second question on the Fios footprint, we have constantly, of course, deployed Fios in this \u2013 in our ILEC to be honest. And what we see right now is very strong demand and we're winning the business. We're deploying -- the team is deploying, as I said, we're heading towards 400,000 open for sale this year and we will continue with that because we see a great demand and our win share is extremely strong in the Fios footprint. On the C-Band, as I said before, there are, of course, challenges in supply chain. But our team has -- I think our team is the most outstanding operation excellence team in the world and they are getting around all of it. On all major equipment, radios, et cetera, that's already secured. This is in a warehouse and that's how we work. I mean, we do long-term planning. with our suppliers years back, so we feel really good about that. There has been some challenges to meet material. the team is working around them every day, finding new solutions in order for us to deploy and they will continue to do so. When it comes to resources, again, we secured our resources year of ahead to be prepared for these types of deployment we have. We are doing more deployment than we have ever done before. You talk about C-Band, we do mmWave 14,000 this year, we do fiber, we do orientations on the 4G, we do Fios, the team -- so it's many things they're doing, and we have never done more than this and I can tell you the team with supply chain and deployment are doing a great job. When it comes to them, 15 million households passed by year-end this year, that includes all the technologies we have. And of course, the second part that we guided for when we had our Investor Day is what to get the 50 million households path later on. So that includes all the technologies, including C-Band of course, and also how we deal with different types of devices, having all the different technology in them. So the team has been planning this, creating opportunities for us. And of course, without coming into 2022 yet, but the opening of the C-Band, we see great new opportunities. And as I said, also, in Investor Day, that means that we can accelerate and amplify our business case on 5G. That was the whole day thing with the C-Band, and the team is geared up for that and very focused. Yes. A lot of moving parts there as you talk about. Again, I mean, I think that what we have -- and now, we start with consumer because remember also our strong position, wireless on the business side and basically we are leading in every segment, so sometimes we forget to talk about our strong areas. But let me start with consumer because I think your question is a little bit more geared to consumer. Remember how we have built our [Indiscernible]. First of all, we have the best network, we have kept the best network. We've augmented and we are, of course, adding more spectrum to it right now with C-Band, so that's very important. The second part is that the value we're doing besides having the best network, of course, with all the offerings we have created over time with Discovery, Disney Plus, which all of them are giving us profitability and retention. And you see the share numbers in this quarter. I think we have found the model with Mix and Match, and if things that we are offering our customers on the wireless side has really paid off with both the loyalty, but also the step-ups. And remember, when Matt talked about that's where I'm now, 1/3 of all the unlimited beyond unlimited premium. But we still have, let's say, 1/3 omitted plan as well. So we have so many steps to continue to move our customers upwards. And that has been a strategy from beginning, and it's clearly different than anybody else in the market, how we can do that. Both offered the best network and the experiences that we have, as well as the Mix and Match that we have in the network. So I feel good about the -- regardless of what type of competition is there and how it changes. We have owner's economics of everything we're doing, that was very clear from the beginning, we'll bring our own fiber, we have the full network and that's why we can have ebbs -- and windows on the network, which will also are benefiting from. So the whole idea with the strategy we laid out is just playing straight into what's happening in the market where mobility and broadband is the essential infrastructure for every individual in the world at the moment. And hey, everybody wants to be here. We have the best assets. That's basically how it looks. I can start with the second question, Michael, as on the inflation. When it comes to our rollout on nationwide broadband and playing with that, of course, remember, we are doing a lot for fiber already right now. We're doing -- Remember, we have been reporting on our One Fiber project, which is still ongoing in the most metropolitan area we're building fiber and of course, that is setting us up to have it all this economics on the broadband and then at the access point, we will do a different type of 4G access. That's what new -- the reason we do that because there's so much after when it comes to coming out to the customer, and we want to be innovate as well and having a self-install and all of that combined with it. That we're always on our fiber when comes on the outside our island, we have looked into buy versus build all the time. We have come to the conclusion we want to build, we built our own fiber network because we want the owner's economics on fiber so that work is already done. So we feel really good about it. We're going to have wireless economic nationwide on broadband over time here. And we can work with our wireless offering, our broadband offering. We, we created the two go-to-market Verizon Consumer and Business Group thinking about our customers, how they do products, how to do platforms, the user experience. This all comes into play right now and I couldn't be more excited on that right now because the momentum for mobility and broadband is happening. We have prepared and worked now for 3 years to get where we are and we -- I feel really good about what we have and the strategy is really working. Look at the last couple of quarters here when we talk about our net additions, talk about the revenue growth. And as I also said, when we spoke earlier, I mean if you look at the second quarter when everybody has reported, we also take the largest share of industry service and all revenue growth in the market. I mean, that's really what we're focusing on. We're focusing on getting the revenue growth. And that's a little bit of the answer to your question on inflation as well that Matt is going to soon take over, of course. We still have a lot on the wireless side where we can migrate customers up to higher plans, and that's of course the best way to see that we are getting incremental revenues from our customers, but also give them more value and experiences. Great question, Colby. First, on Mobile Edge Computer, first of all, we're doing a great progress in Mobile Edge Computer and you've seen that we're made announcements in the quarter with the biggest cloud providers in the market, both on the private 5G Mobile Edge Computer. And as you remember, there are basically 3 use cases. One, is the public Mobile Edge Computer, and then it's a private Mobile Edge Computer, and then it's private 5G networks. All of them are in execution right now. We're working with customers. We have announced a couple of commercial contracts already, like coordinating the British fort, etc. So that's already happening. And, And of course it takes some time because we are actually creating a total new market, and we're actually alone in this market. Nobody else in the world has launched mobile edge compute at this moment. So of course, we feel really good about that. And the team is working through the funnel all the way from proof of context to new applications. And that's how it works, when you create new markets, etc. So we will come back as soon as we feel it's time to start reporting it as we're have done with five-weeks fixed wireless access, but even more excited or the Mobile Edge Computer what I've seen the last year here with the technology solutions we have, and also the customer interaction we have together with the main partners. I mean, we have the biggest partners you can ever think about in this that are equally much invested as us, because that was part of the strategy to bring different parties. We have there, so we will continue with that. And we will come back and report, and we will give you new deals and how all this is progressing with partners over time and ultimately, of course, it's going to be financials and that's going to show up. Initially, of course, it's going to be on Verizon Business Group that's going to have that as revenue. The rest would be to see opportunity longer term, which can end up in consumer but predominantly in the beginning is a Verizon business group opportunity. Matt on guidance, have you thought through what you're going to do next year? He hasn't told me yet. I can start with the second one. First of all, we rely on the RootMetrics because that's the most sophisticated and scientific way of measuring the network, and it's -- we're undoubtedly the leader there. And without going into my competition because I never talk about them, but clearly one is always lost. So if we're done talking about TracFone, which is of course an exciting opportunity for us, which is still to be closed. We're not -- we don't have the go-to-market and the brands that TracFone have. They are so good on prepaid, and they've showed that. But at we will, of course, support them with these all the back-end support, all the way from supply chain, IT support, UX customer care, and all of that. But clearly, we want to keep the points of sales. We want to keep the offerings, and we want to serve the value market. That's where we are. I cannot go further into that because we still have the pending approval of it, but we will give you even more color, Craig, as soon as we have closed this one. I talked about the fixed wireless access on the business side. It's called BCC Internet on that signed offering we have. And of course, we started off with our fixed wireless access on the consumer side, and we later on added in our business to actually have access to it. That's why because that's what we want to restart. I wouldn't say we have really good traction on the business side on fixed wireless actions, small and medium businesses. clearly where we have our stronghold, and we're being the clear leader. So we see this as a great opportunity for our Verizon Business Group as well. And again, we are now adding products and solution for Verizon Business Group that over time should offset the wireline decline that we have that Matt talked about. When we talk about the Verizon Business Group, I haven't talked enough about them, but the momentum on wireless there is really good. Look at it, small and medium business are coming back. They're doing a great job. On the enterprise side, the wireless business is doing well as well. The only area is the public sector that's coming a little bit back, but that's a very natural thing because the increased demand of home education and etc. During the COVID, of course, had a spike in wireless connections, which you see is naturally coming down a little bit right now. But the momentum on the wireless side, on the Verizon Business Group, and then you add the new opportunities, everything from application on top of the network, the Mobile Edge Computer, the fixed wireless access. And over time, more so opportunities outside the ILEC on vials, or at least on fiber. So that's a great opportunity for us, and that's what we outlined already in 2019 when we decided to transform that business to see that we are really well prepared for capturing those opportunities and those transformations that all the enterprise will need and companies will do to digitalize over time. So I think we're in a good place. [Indiscernible] team are doing a great job."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.40 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported second quarter earnings include a net pre-tax gain from special items of approximately $182 million, consisting of a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.3 billion related to a pension remeasurement credit, as well as a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion from early debt redemption costs. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.37 in the second quarter. In May, we announced an agreement to sell Verizon Media to Apollo Funds with an expected close date in the second-half of 2021. Upon the announcement, certain assets of the Verizon Media business were classified as an asset held for sale. As a result, we no longer depreciate or amortize these assets, which resulted in a partial quarter benefit of $0.03 per share in the second quarter, and this benefit will continue until the deal closes. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. It is remarkable the difference a year can make. We're quickly resuming pre-pandemic norms and at Verizon our network and in-store traffic is almost back to pre-pandemic volumes, and our office employees are gradually going back to office. Of course, some behaviors are changed permanently. The mass shift toward online activity, speed up the timeline for work from home, distant learning, banking, entertainment, telemedicine, et cetera. All of these societal and behavioral shifts have had an impact on the business. And they reaffirm our network as a service strategy and our focus on delivering on our five vectors of growth. Finally, after a year of virtual meetings, I've been spending time in the field with customers and partners, and importantly, with our frontline workers, who have done such heroic work throughout the past year serving our customers. All-in-all, we\u2019ve a very enthusiastic and cautiously optimistic stakeholder base. As we conclude the first-half of 2021, I have to say, I'm extremely proud of the achievements we have made to strengthen Verizon in all aspects. Let me mention a couple of the milestones. We strengthened our strategic focus with our divestment of Verizon Media Group, which we believe will close around the end of the quarter. We invested in the best portion of the C-Band in order to accelerate and amplify our multipurpose network as a service model. We have also improved our 2.0 organizational structure, and we brought in a diverse slate of top leaders. Our finance and treasury team did an outstanding job of strengthening our balance sheet, with low cost of borrowing and maturity for our debt. We also laid out a long-term financial goal with focus on growth. All this focus on strategy execution and to deliver profitable growth by our teams have paved the way for a continued great financial performance. And in the second quarter, we not only generated our strongest earnings on record, we also produced good growth and profitability in all our units and segments. We demonstrated continued strength in a wireless service revenue growth. And combined with our scale and operational efficiency, we produced 5.6% adjusted to EBITDA growth. Given the strength on our first-half results, we're raising our full year guide, and Matt will provide details later in the call. When it comes to our operations, our recent investments in our customers through the biggest 5G upgrade promotion and innovative trading, coupled with a mix and match for both wireless and Fios customers had led to strong performance across both our offerings. On the network side, we just continue to offer our customer the industry's best network experience. For the 16th consecutive time, RootMetrics awarded Verizon the best overall network performance. And for the 27th consecutive times, JD Power named us the number one network quality. Our C-Band build, we're on track to build 7,000 to 8,000 sites by year-end, and we're on plan to launch the first 46 markets. And we're also strengthening our network by expanding our fixed wireless access reach. If we look to the traffic in the network, the customer activity is near pre-COVID levels. And as mobility traffic comes back, we've seen mmWave uses increase 290% June year-to-date. And as we continue to deploy mmWave sites, and we add more device penetration, we expect these numbers to continue to increase fast, and track towards 5% to 10% of traffic in most dense urban areas by year-end. We're making progress in executing across all our five vectors of growth. On the 5G adoption, approximate 20% of our wireless phone base are now on 5G devices, with a majority of them C-Band capable. In the second quarter the step-up rates were very, very healthy, and this reflects value and differentiated experience for our customers. We also had a record high new accounts that opted for a premium unlimited plan. The Next Generation business application, we launched the first commercially available private 5G network solution in the U.S. It's an on-site, private 5G that brings on-premise 5G capabilities to large enterprises and public sector customers. The team in Verizon business group continued to make very important partnerships, and one of them in the quarter was with Mastercard, where we will work together with Mastercard on 5G Mobile Edge Compute, transforming the contactless payment for consumer as well as small and medium-sized businesses. The customer differentiation that we continue to develop further strengthened in the quarter, when new content and experience to our mix and match platform with a broken device trading, the biggest upgrade ever promotion. And we'll also add through partnership content with Apple Arcade and Google Play pass. Expansion into new markets, we have been focusing continue to have broadband nationwide, and we expanded our 5G Home Services, which is now available across 47 markets. On the 4G home, we expanded to more suburban and urban areas. And it's now available in parts of all 50 states. At the same time we launched a new home router which is compatible with the C-Band. Finally, we have recently expanded our 5G business internet also to parts of 42 cities. In summary, our strategy is working, and it's more relevant than ever, driving value for our investors and to our customers and society, as they embrace new ways of living and working. We have great momentum on all five vector growth, delivering on profit growth with alignment for long-term growth targets. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to, Matt, to discuss the financial results.\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were exceptional, both financially and operationally. We continue to execute on our strategy, driving contributions from all five growth vectors. We attracted new customers and accounts and delivered low churn amid strong upgrade activity, all of which serves to accelerate 5G adoption in advance with our C-Band deployment later this year. Accelerating volumes contributed to another quarter of strong sequential wireless service revenue growth, building off our industry-leading performance in recent quarters. At the same time, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. Let's go through the details beginning on Slide 6. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $33.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year. Service and other revenue rose 5.7%, driven by strength in wireless, Fios and media. Equipment revenue rose 47.6% year-over-year, given COVID impacted sales a year ago, and was up more than 17% from second quarter 2019 levels, driven by healthy upgrade activity. Total wireless service revenues were up 5.9% year-over-year, and 4.0% compared to second quarter 2019. The results represent sequential growth of $139 million, nearly double our industry-leading sequential growth reported in the first quarter. Total Fios revenues were up 5.4% year-over-year, driven by continued broadband subscriber growth. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion grew 5.6% over the prior year, in line with our service and other revenue growth, despite absorbing approximately $60 million of incremental tower lease costs related to the updated agreements to accelerate the deployment of our C-Band spectrum. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.37, the best on record. The execution of our strategy is translated into record earnings results, and we are well-positioned to continue the momentum into the second-half of the year. Now, let's review our operating segment results, starting with consumer on Slide 7. Momentum built throughout the quarter, and we timed our promotions to take full advantage of the economic recovery and increased customer activity. The result was one of our strongest net new wireless account quarters. With stores fully opened and consumer behavior closer to pre-pandemic levels, we delivered 1.7 million of postpaid phone gross ads in the quarter, up from 1.2 million in second quarter 2020, and almost identical to 2019 levels. Phone churn of 0.65% remained favorable throughout the quarter, and benefited from new offers in the marketplace. This result was a record low for a non-COVID impacted quarter. As a result of phone net ads of 197,000 were our best second quarter for consumer. The response to our differentiated customer proposition, including the broken device trading, and the biggest upgrade ever promotion was terrific. Device upgrades, which was significantly higher compared to both second quarter 2020 and 2019, drove 5G adoption and step-ups to premium unlimited plans, a strong indicator that our strategy is working. We exited the second quarter with approximately 20% of our phone base using 5G capable devices, with the vast majority supporting C-Band. In addition, step-up rates were historically high, and nearly 60% of new accounts opted for a premium unlimited plan, a record high. At quarter-end, approximately 69% of our account base was on unlimited plans, with nearly 27% of our account base on premium unlimited plans. The quality and reliability of our Fios service, combined with the simplicity of our mix and match offerings continues to drive strong demand for broadband. Fios internet net ads totaled 92,000 in the quarter, supported by strong customer retention, and our Fios internet customer base is more than 7% higher than a year ago. Our trailing 12-month total Fios internet net ad performance is the highest since 2015. Now, let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the consumer financial performance. The improved customer activity translated to impressive top-line trends. Total revenue for the quarter grew 11.2% year-over-year, and was also 6.7% higher versus second quarter 2019. Equipment revenue was the biggest driver, rebounding above pre-COVID levels from higher activations, aided by our customer value proposition. Wireless service revenue momentum translated to 5.4% year-over-year growth, and 2.5% growth compared to second quarter 2019. Service revenue is driven by customer growth, step-ups, products such as content, as well as reseller and prepaid. This growth comes despite minimal contributions from international roaming, which we expect should provide a further uptick to growth in future quarters. Momentum in Fios continues with revenues of $2.9 billion, surpassing pre-COVID levels, driven by the continued uptake of gigabit speeds. The results represent our highest revenue results ever. We remain encouraged by the continued margin improvement within Fios, driven by the adoption of mix and match plans and a greater contribution from broadband. Consumer segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 4.9% over 2020, representing an EBITDA margin of 44.3%, down from the prior year, primarily resulting from higher activations. Now, let's move to our business segment on Slide 9. Business wireless activity was highlighted by postpaid gross ads of 1.2 million, up 6.3% over the second quarter 2020, and up 2.1% over the second quarter 2019. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.07%, up 17 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated disconnects from COVID-related purchases in 2020, particularly within the education vertical of public sector. As schools plan for more in-person learning this fall, we expect disconnects to remain elevated in public sector in the third quarter. Despite the disconnect pressures, phone net adds was strong at 78,000, with improving trends in both SMB and enterprise, both of which posted their strongest phone net ads in over a year, offset in the disconnects in public sector. Let's now move to Slide 10, to review the business financial performance. The business segment delivered strong top-line growth with total revenue up 3.7% year-over-year. Equipment revenue, which is up approximately 47% was the primary driver of the increase. Wireless service revenue growth of 8.0% was driven by strong momentum in small and medium business, and the first quarter of enterprise growth since the onset of the pandemic. Public Sector continue to show strong growth over 2020, though is pressured by COVID-related churn in education. The wireless strength was partially offset by declines in business wireline, which returned to a more normal trajectory after elevated COVID-related demand. Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% in the quarter, down approximately 210 basis points year-over-year, mostly driven by higher equipment volumes and wireline pressure. While pressures likely persist in the near-term, the economic reopening, business transformation initiatives and 5G for enterprise provide opportunities to drive margin. Now, let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued its recent trends and delivered strong performance, driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion, up approximately 50% from a year ago, and up 13% from second quarter 2019. Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the first-half of 2021 totaled $20.4 billion, compared with $23.6 billion from the prior year. The change was primarily driven by higher cash taxes and higher working capital requirements due to greater volumes. The cash tax impact was a result of a one-time benefit received in the second quarter of 2020, as well as COVID-related postponements of payments in the year ago period. These expected headwinds were offset by our strong operational results. Capital spending for the first-half of 2021 totaled $8.7 billion, as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G ultra wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $160 million in the first-half, and we have placed orders for approximately $1.4 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us a confidence that we will be within the previously provided $2 billion to $3 billion range for the year. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first-half of the year of $11.7 billion. During the quarter, we began to normalize our cash balance closer to the pre-pandemic levels given the macro environment, and we ended the period with $4.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a sequential change of $5.4 billion. We exited the quarter with unsecured debt of $141.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $6 billion, as we continue to focus on optimizing our debt footprint. Our total borrowing costs in the second quarter were $1.4 billion, which was relatively flat to second quarter 2019 levels, despite having approximately $40 billion in additional debt this year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the first-half was $136.8 billion, and our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9 times. Now, let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. Our strong first-half performance and the momentum in our business gives us the confidence to raise guidance. Please note, that the updated guidance reflects the planning assumption that the Verizon Media sale closes at the end of the third quarter. Starting with revenue, we are raising our wireless service revenue growth outlook to 3.5% to 4%, up from the prior 3% plus. The drivers of the revised outlook are broad based and include positive trends we are seeing for customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services such as cloud and content, as well as prepaid and reseller growth. The anticipated timing of the Verizon Media sale means we would not recognize any revenue from that business in the fourth quarter. As a result, service and other revenue is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with 2020, and we are withdrawing that growth guidance at this time. Turning to earnings, we now expect an adjusted EPS range of $5.25 to $5.35, up from the prior range of $5 to $5.15. The increase is driven by the improved wireless service revenue outlook, the aforementioned media DNA benefit, and a reduction in the expected interest expense related to the C-Band investment. Our guidance for the effective tax rate and CapEx were unchanged. In summary, we're competing effectively and delivering strong volumes, growing accounts, driving healthy step-ups and positioning our base to capitalize long-term, as we grow 5G adoption. Our customer performance has led to quality financial results, as demonstrated by the sequential wireless service revenue growth, while also flow into the bottom line with best on record adjusted EPS. We entered the second-half with a lot of momentum, and I am confident we will continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results, throughout the remainder of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of 2021.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. At our Investor Day, we laid out commitments for 2021 and beyond to scale our network as a service strategy and generate GDP plus growth. We made transformative investment over the last 12-months through acquisitions, divestiture and customer innovation, and creating a strong platform for growth in the second-half of 2021 and beyond. Our priorities for the second-half, continue to build on our current network and customer initiatives to further amplify and accelerate 5G adoption, further cement our network leadership through industry-leading mmWave and C-Band assets. We expect to close our TracFone and VMG transaction later this year, increasing our focus on what we do best, and bringing innovation and best-in-class customer experience to the value segment. And overall, drive growth across our five vectors with disciplined and customer focused execution. At the end, the great transformation in the first-half, we competed very well in the marketplace, and we're very confident and excited on our opportunities ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brady for the Q&A.\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Sir, please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Yeah, thanks for taking the question, and two if you don't mind. First, I just want to go back to some of the color Matt was giving on the improved outlook for wireless service revenue growth this year. At the high-end, that's actually a pretty significant improvement. I know you outlined a number of things that were behind it, but I was hoping you can maybe just dig into that a bit more. I'm particularly interested in what you're doing to outperform as it relates to plan mix? And then are you seeing a return of any of the fees that had come out of the run rate last year? Is that something you've seen already? Or, is that embedded in the outlook? And then, just on the improved EPS guidance, if we just sort of look at the $0.03 benefit you got from moving away from the DNA media in the recent quarter, that would imply that the improvements your outlook this year maybe captures $0.07, $0.08, just from that accounting shift with the rest of it being operational. But if it's more nuanced than that, I think we all appreciate that insight. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I can start and Matt will fill in. But I think that on the service revenue, I think you've seen the last four quarters right now how the team has done a fantastic job to differentiate our offerings, all the way to see that our customers are doing step-ups, they're taking down limited premium. And as Matt said, there have been 60% of the new accounts in the quarter was taking a limited premium. The penetration 5G is happening. So we just continue -- the team we\u2019re growing on the consumer side, if we talk about that. They have these more than we've added for several years, where we do the mix and match. We have a differentiation and it is clearly resonating in the market. And at the same time, we see, of course, they call them and calling back, the stores are getting almost back to pre-pandemic. So, all in all, it's a good timing for us and that's also why we feel good about our guidance, and how the service revenue is growing. And remember, we're always focused on profitable growth. That's what the team is doing. If Matt and I see opportunities, we support the team to do it, but as long as it's going to be a profitable growth. And that's what we're seeing right now, with all the momentum in the market. The team is taking advantage of that. And that also translates back to the guidance. But, all in all, I would say this is our strategy, we've been having for a couple of years and has been very successful. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. Thanks, Hans, and thanks for the question, Brett. So, starting with the question about wireless service revenue growth, and as Hans mentioned, it's really building on the momentum that we've seen in the first-half of the year. The continuation of the sequential service revenue growth, we saw that the prior couple of quarters, we saw that increase even further, in the second quarter. We expect that trend to continue as we get into the second-half of the year, because of the operational momentum that Hans mentioned, more step-ups to higher price plans, et cetera, et cetera. In terms of the fees, obviously, the year-over-year component is rather unique this time, as second quarter last year was the most heavily impacted by COVID. And more specifically, for us, of course, we had to keep Americans connected pledge that was in place for all of the second quarter that as you said, impacted some of the fees. As you think about the numbers this year, a good chunk of those are back in. We're more at a BAU level. A couple of items, though that aren't in the numbers yet, obviously, international travel is not back to anywhere close to pre-pandemic levels. I don't expect that to be there, for the balance of this year. Hope there'll be a tailwind as we get into next year, but the guide doesn't make any assumption about an acceleration over return of those fees in the second-half of \u201821. One other thing I\u2019d draw attention to as well, when you look at our numbers, and you think about return of fees, one of the things has been very strong in the first-half of the year is customer payment patterns, which is a great thing to see. And certainly, with all the stimulus payments out there, there's a lot of money in the system, and customers are actually paying more frequently. So, even though, we're back to normal in terms of things like late fees, we're actually charging significantly less than we were in second quarter of \u201919, because more of our customers are paying on time at this point, which is certainly a trend that we're very happy to see. So, some of the fees are back. But not all of them are back when you think about it. And we're not assuming they will be back in for the balance of the year. The guide is based off of the strong operational momentum in the business, customers stepping up to those higher price plans, and we see that momentum continuing. Your second question about the EPS guidance, and obviously, glad to be able to raise the guidance that's based off having a very healthy business that is performing exceptionally well. As you mentioned, some of the upside to the guidance comes from the media depreciation, amortization, probably about $0.06 to $0.08, depending on the timing of the close. But the majority of its coming from cash items, whether that be the wireless service revenue guide, we were just discussing, but also related to improved expectation around cash interest expense, lower than anticipated at the start of the year. So, most of the guide is driven by cash-related items, and that's of course, based off the strong momentum you see in the business, both operationally and financially.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for that color.\nBrady Connor: Great. Yeah. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just question on the upgrade rate, obviously, it's up not just year-over-year, but even over the \u201819 levels. Do you expect that trend to continue and maybe even accelerate as we move into the second-half of the year? And then, if you could comment on the impact on margins? I would imagine that, it helps incentivize people to move into those higher price premium plans. But the higher mix of equipment revenues may put pressure on margins. So, just how you foresee the sort of margin trends in the second-half as these volumes built would be great? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. As I said before, we have this formula right now that we've had since we launched unlimited, with both mix and match, and then our value proposition that we have done. And you saw in the second quarter, that now we added also gaming with good traction with both Google and Apple gaming. And this is a unique model for us. At the same time, of course, we have excitement around 5G, what we have in our network is performing extremely well. So, I think that our team, they have a very, very good model for continuing this. I think, I said it in the first quarter, it will become more of this value proposition and differentiation. And yes, it came, we went into gaming. So, I say it again, I have a lot of confidence in the team in Ronan's team to continue to come up with things that our customer loves, and using our distribution, our network and a brand to continue to grow this. And that is the whole strategy. Remember, the five vectors of growth, we\u2019re playing in all five of them, and that's why we are also confident all of our long-term guidance without a doubt. And you see part that in this quarter that we already are executing on all of these vectors.\nMatthew Ellis: Hey, John. So, as you mentioned, obviously, the higher mix of equipment revenues shows up in the margin percentage. But, I think you also have to look at the margin dollars, which are up sequentially, and also up significantly year-over-year. So, very happy with that performance at the margin line. As you say, when we have a higher equipment revenue, it has an impact on the margin, but I like the combination of volumes and margin that we had in the second quarter. As we head to the second-half of the year with the outline of our -- and the office we have in place that Hans mentioned, combined with new devices coming into the market. As we get closer to 5G launch, the underlying strength in the economy, I would expect that we will see good equipment volumes in the second-half of the year. And I would also expect to see good EBITDA dollars in the second-half of the year to go along with that.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, John. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys, thanks. Two if I can, consumer wireless broadband were strong. Did home broadband drive that? And how many home 4G, 5G customers do you have now? And second, a lot happening in NBN online these days with Boost going after AT&T, after they couldn't cable away last year. Did you look at that deal? How do you think about the potential for new competition from all these channels? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks. When it comes to broadband in general, that was brought up on our vision as we have outlined, we want to be a nationwide broadband provider, and we're going to use to access technology that is best suited for our customers in a mix of everything from fiber to 4G to 5G mmWave, C-Band, and all of that. And this quarter, we'll open up even more opportunities for that. We will open more 5G home markets, we will open more 4G home markets. And then of course, as Matt outlined as well, we took more Fios\u2019 subscribers than ever in the last three, four quarters. So this is playing out well for us. We're opening up all of that. We are very excited about what's going to happen in the second-half with a new CP that has C-Band as well. So, we executed everything we said we should do in the Investor Day, in the second quarter. And we look forward to the second-half of this year, and we will continue the report out what we're doing. The second question, I think that we're open for business, but we don't comment on any particular deals in a market or something like that. But we are happy with the customers we have on our MNO.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks so much. Just a quick one on TracFone, you said, closing in the second-half of the year. Any more color on the process, or the more timing expectations would be great. And then, on the C-Band, I think you said previously you wanted to deploy about 7,000 to 8,000 towers later this year. I see you reiterated the CapEx guide, but any color on getting the equipment supply chain and the ability to hit those targets in terms of rolling out? And any updates to your longer-term targets of 175 million on C-Band, how are you thinking beyond that? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: So, on the TracFone, I think nothing has changed since we outlined or we proposed acquisition. It\u2019s tracking according to plan with a process that we need to go through. The team is responding to all the questions we have. So it's going to be in the latter part on the second-half of the 2021, as we thought all the time. So, nothing strange, it's actually on track. But that's where we are. Second question was\u2026\nMatthew Ellis: C-Band.\nHans Vestberg: C-Band, yeah. The 7,000 to 8,000 sites, yeah, we can definitely say we're on track. When we reported the first quarter, we had just started everything. Now we feel we have a full funnel in the supply chain. The guys in our supply chain done a great job with our partners. We have all the gears we need to deploy the 7,000 to 8,000, and our team executing very well. So, we feel very good about being able to have 7,000 to 8,000 sites up by year-end. And when it comes for the long-term, I mean, we have the same ambitions as before, we haven't changed those, and we continue to execute. So, we will do it as fast as we can, given the different types of milestones that are involved in the spectrum. But, so far, we are executing on that plan, and we're on or ahead on the plan of executing right now for the end of the year.\nMatthew Ellis: Simon, one other data point for you, the vast majority of the radios that we need to turn on those 7,000 to 8,000 sites already seeing in our warehouses. So, the supply chain is robust, working very well with our partners. And, obviously a lot of work still to do, but the network teams from where we were in March, after we came out of the auction to where we are today. Their detailed plans in place and they are executing strongly against it.\nSimon Flannery: And the spectrum clearing is working okay?\nMatthew Ellis: Spectrum clearing is also on track. We stay close to the folks doing everything. We hear from them is that's completely on track as well.\nSimon Flannery: Sounds good. Thanks a lot.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Simon. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys, thanks so much. In the first quarter, you guys talked about how the second-half of the year would be an improvement for Verizon in the consumer business. We've seen obviously some of the new promotions come out. Margins have drifted down to the 44% range. Does Ronan have permission from you, Hans, to take that down further, if you see some more gains opportunistically in the second-half with either the current kind of 5G handset upgrade promotions or new stuff coming down the pipe? And then the second question is consumer cost of service has been up pretty significantly for the last couple quarters relative to the past year. Is that related to CBM prepositioning? Or, is there something else going on? And what's the outlook for that? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: When it comes to the consumer group, and Matt explained a little bit why the margin is lower, because the hardware part of it is included there. And we think it\u2019s a good sign on what's happening in the market. I would say David, we constantly think about profitable growth and that has been our strategy as long as I have been here. And Ronan and team, they think about that. But of course, if they see an opportunity, as we saw when the traffic came back into stores, and they call them it\u2019s coming back, we did some offerings in this quarter, which was good timing. And we will continue to support Ronan, where we see he has a good solution for the market and our customers are going to love it. And I can tell you, our differentiation is really resonating with the market and that's what you see in the second quarter. And we will come back and see if there's something he wants to do in the second-half. But clearly, we're focused on profitable growth and we want to have -- we are writing high-quality business in high-quantity. That's what we want to do. And I think you see that coming through in these results.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah, so just adding to Hans, so obviously, the margin percent will be impacted by the volumes. We saw good volumes in the second quarter. But as Han said, what we're focused on is if you also look in their sequential service revenue growth continue to lead the industry in that, because not all net ads are created equal. And that also come in with EBITDA dollars increasing. So the margin percentage will play out where it does based off the volumes. But we're focused on you have seen that sequential revenue increase, and also the EBITDA dollars flowing in the right direction. In terms of your question around the cost of service, predominantly in consumer, but I think one of the items that we had in the second quarter was a step-up in the network rents and lease of about $60 million a quarter, as a result of the new lease payments we put in place. As you know, under the accounting, you look at the total payments over the life of the lease and kind of flat line irrespective of how the actual cash flow payments flows. So, there was obviously a significant upgrade to our lease agreements. And that was a one-time step-up in the quarterly rate there that flow through the books that\u2019s let\u2019s say about $60 million, close to a penny a share impact from that, that should be the same going forward now. So that's the biggest driver you're seeing on the cost of service.\nDavid Barden: So Matt, just maybe follow-up on that.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Dave. Okay. Go ahead, Dave.\nDavid Barden: Thanks. So just, that's all in consumer?\nMatthew Ellis: The vast majority of the wireless network costs are allocated to consumers, some of that is in business, but the majority is in consumer. Obviously, the majority of the customers, the majority of the wireless service revenue is in consumer. And so the costs are going to be allocated largely in line on a similar basis to that. So yes, most of it is in consumer.\nDavid Barden: And then probably worth noting that then your EPS guidance includes negative $0.03 for the two, three, four Q impact of that increased tower expense.\nMatthew Ellis: Absolutely, that's fully baked into the guidance and step-up in that cost. So, that comes back to the underlying strength of the business that we have even with that, that baked in as well.\nDavid Barden: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good morning. Curious what you learned during the pandemic and now the reopening, about where customers want to transact for wireless, whether it's upgrading phones, with changing service providers? And, are a large portion of wireless transactions simply destined to remain in physical locations, versus a virtual or online channel? And then just to follow-up, you mentioned a number of markets that you've been focused on for ultra wideband and 5G home. Just curious if you could share some population and household coverage numbers for ultra wideband and home for the end of \u201921, and target for the end of \u201922. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. No, of course, we see some changes in behavior when it comes to our customers. But, we had already started building our omni-channel that our customer can start on the web, and they can end in the store, or they can start in the store and on the phone, and all of that in order to see that they will do these as seamless as possible. But clearly, we see much more digital than before. But also, when the economy came back and the vaccinations in the United States were coming up on high levels, we also saw the traffic coming back into stores. So we\u2019ve had, I would say all our stores opened in the second quarter, and we see much more foot traffic than we have seen in the previous quarters. Not really back to pre-pandemic days, but clearly, fairly close. So, we think our customers still going to want to come into a store and see our technology and our products, but they might be wanting to finish the delivery and the purchase in a digital format. And that's how we build our store. So we're working very closely to see that the new behaviors that we can meet that\u2019s where our customers really feel good about dealing with us, and I think that our team are doing a great job in that area.\nMatthew Ellis: Mike, in terms of your question around the mmWave coverage, we don't really talk about the mmWave coverage. In terms of pops, you heard Hans mentioned upfront that we're on track to seeing 5% to 10% of dense urban usage on our mmWave by the end of the year. That's a combination of more customers having 5G devices in their hands, customer activity moving back to more pre-pandemic levels, and then, obviously, building out more mmWave sites. We said we would do 14,000 sites this year, over 30,000 by the end of the year. I can tell you, we are running well ahead of schedule for the 14,000 sites through the first-half of the year. And so as we do that, we continue to add coverage. And then we said we'd expect to cover 1 million to 2 million homes with mmWave open for sale by the end of the year. And we're on track with all of those items.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Any early look to 2022?\nMatthew Ellis: The build continues \u2013 obviously, we're not going to give guidance for 2022, but everything the network team is doing whether on mmWave, whether on C-Band. And remember, we said we'd be at around 100 million pops during the first quarter next year. We expect still on track to be at that level. So at this point in time, I can't speak more highly about the work the network team is doing as they build, whether it's the fiber that obviously is important to the network, the mmWave expansion, the C-Band expansion and continuing to have the best 4G network out there as well. So, they're doing a tremendous man activity, and they continue to be on both our 2021 plans and our longer-term plans, too.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open, sir.\nCraig Moffett: Yes. Hi, thank you. Two quick questions. First of all, I am going to return to a question that Phil asked, I didn't hear the discussion. Can you talk about the Dish wholesale deal with AT&T? What your observations are? And, whether you were part of that negotiation? And then separately, if you could just comment on whether you saw any significant impacts from the EBBP program during the quarter, either in your wireline business with Fios or your wireless business?\nHans Vestberg: Hey, when it comes to specific deals in the market, we don't comment on that. And apparently, this is something that AT&T won from T-Mobile, so I cannot comment on our involvement in itself or not. But as I said, we're open for business. We have a natural strategy model, which is paying off well for us with the five vectors of growth, and part of that is monetization of MNOs and we're very happy what we have.\nMatthew Ellis: Craig, to your second question, we saw some of our customer base certainly participate in that during the course of the second quarter. I wouldn't say it was a significant impact in our numbers, but we did certainly see our customers participating.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Greg. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Oh, great. Thank you. Two questions for me as well. I mean, first, AT&T moved to 30 and 36-month handset, EIPs periods this quarter, and your churn is even lower than theirs. Your customers stick around even longer on average. Have you thought about going longer than 24-months? And if not, why is 24-months sort of right period? And, I'm just really curious on C-Band, as we try to figure out how to model 2022 and you get the licenses cleared, and you put the switch and light that up for customers. As you go into 2022, how's your go-to-market strategy change, if at all? And what do consumers sort of see in terms of their experience that's going to be materially different? Obviously, it was a big investment, and I'm just sort of thinking through on a practical basis, what happens if that starts to kick in?\nHans Vestberg: Yeah, I can start with the C-Band. For obvious reason, we think it's an important moment. We are both amplifying and accelerating our 5G in the network, amplifying the opportunity. However, given away our commercial ideas when we're going to launch this right now we wouldn't do that. But, of course, we are excited over it. We think it's going to be great for our customer, it\u2019s going to be fantastic performance and it expands our 5G mobility options, our 5G fixed wireless access options, and it also extends our 5G Mobile Edge Compute options. So, it's just playing straight into our strategy. So we are excited over it. And we will come back how we will bring that to our customers, so they are equally delighted as they are with our network today, but it\u2019s getting something that is so much superior than anybody else.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. Hey, Doug, on your first question about the handsets device payment period, we're very comfortable with the offers we have in the marketplace. It's 24-months for a lot of items. Some of the higher priced items, it's a little bit longer just to manage that. But, as you mentioned, the churn is very, very strong. Dot six, five, and consumer for phone shows what we're doing with customers is working very, very effectively. If we feel the need to adjust it, we will do so, but it will be based off of what we see customers need and not be focused on any impact on the accounting treatment associated with it. So, we will continue to be focused on finding the right offers for our customers. And, I think you see from the results in the second quarter, what we're doing is resonating with customers, both from an ad standpoint and also a churn standpoint too.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Doug. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Supino of Bernstein. Your line is open, sir.\nPeter Supino: Hi, thank you. A couple of related questions. The first is one of your competitors has talked repeatedly about the network capacity improvements that come from 5G. If you adjust that company's target for M&A, you could infer that their capacity is up about seven times for their 5G expansion. And so, I'm wondering if you could suggest a similar number for Verizon\u2019s capacity and growth potential, considering the wonderful investment in the C-Band? And then, on a related note, as relates to the home business, I'm curious if you could describe how you think about allocating the cost of spectrum?\nHans Vestberg: Okay. On the first one, if you've been listening to what I've talked about around 5G before, first of all, 5G as a technology is better to handle data than 4G. And that's obvious, it really is better than 4G as well. So that's happening. Then you need to add to that -- you're not only talking about spectrum, you're talking about how you engineer and how you build the network. So in our case, of course, we see great opportunities for being able to handle much more data. And remember, today on the mmWave, we might use 400, sometimes 800 megahertz, but not more, and we have 1600 megahertz nationwide. So, there's so much more we can do. And as Kyle showed at the Investor Day, our headroom in the network is bigger than before. And that's before we start building what we're building right now. So we feel really confident how many ex we are doing. And remember, our 4G is already the best in the nation. And then we are adding up right now what we're doing in 5G that is also extraordinary good. So others can talk and we usually execute, and we will continue with that.\nMatthew Ellis: So Peter, on the second part of your question about allocating costs of the spectrum. I've reframed that and actually view it from the standpoint of this is the first time that we've had wireless technology, where we can drive multiple revenue streams off of the same network build, whether that be the mobility, which has obviously been the foundation of 4G, 3G, and everything since the start of wireless. But then the ability to also have fixed wireless access, to also have the public mobile edge compute, all coming off of that same network build, that same network investment, we think gives us the opportunity to provide a very good return on the investment that we've made in both C-Band and mmWave.\nPeter Supino: Thank you very much.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Peter. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open, sir.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. A couple if I could. Firstly, on the non-paid churn front, obviously that I think you guys noted the benefit because of some of the subsidy programs. But, at some point that will probably reverse for the industry as a whole. So could you help us understand how big of an impact that typically is in a normalized year, non-paid churn? And how much of a tailwind that is right now to get a sense for what that might do, when things normalize? And then secondly, I mean, you have a lot of content bundles now, you also have the new deal with Apple Arcade. Could you give us some sense for how this impacts your cost of service? And how much of the increase in cost of service is on accounted base? You did quantify the least number, but it would be good to get some sense for what this is doing overall to cost versus [indiscernible] kind of trends? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can, and Matt will talk about no-paid churn. When it comes to the content deal, I think I've said it a couple of times now. Our whole idea is to offering exclusive offers for our wireless customers. And we also want to offer that partnership to brands that we really think resonate with us. And the model, as we\u2019ve spoken about before is that this is incremental revenue for us. It's not only loyalty, it's actually incremental profit for us.  So it's a totally different model that might sometimes not been in the market before, because suddenly, we use the best network, the best distribution and the best brand to work with companies like Disney Plus, et cetera, to give our customers a premium experience, on top of the differentiation we're already have with a mix and match. And ultimately, when we make these customers to paying customers, we get our fair share of that, because we with our assets have created it together with the asset for Disney Plus, Discovery or gaming et cetera. So that's how the model is working. And as I said before, we're very pleased with it. I think we've six or seven of these offerings in the market right now and all of them are very positive to us and to our customers. And we will continue to see if we can find more. I think it\u2019s a unique model that we have created that nobody else has in the market. And as I said, again, it goes back to Ronan and the team being very, very innovative and creative to see that we bring the best to our customer, not only the best network, but also the differentiation in offering. So I have to say I'm very pleased with that. And as I said, we've more in the funnel.\nMatthew Ellis: Kannan, on your other question around the churn, I would say it's a very small number of basis points of benefit coming from the reduction in what we call involuntary churn. And what you're also seeing in the total churn number is actually the benefits of the engagement with the customer, the experience the customer has on the network, the other experiences we bring to that relationship that Hans just touched on, being a bigger piece of the strength in the overall phone churn number that we reported, especially on the consumer side. And in terms of the impact of cost of sales, obviously, the content cost associated with the items that Hans mentioned, do flow through there. And you should expect to see that number continue to be a contributor of that line. But when we look at the overall profitability of bringing that together, the overall customer proposition, it's EBITDA additive to the business, and also brings a better experience to the customers. We see that as a win-win.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you, both.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Kannan. Brad, we've got time for one more question. Let's go to one last question, please.\nOperator: Certainly, your last question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First off on business EBITDA margins, at your Analyst Day back in March, you'd guided to sustaining north of 25%. And we saw that below that in the second quarter, also in the first quarter, although there's that one-time impact. And it sounds like you're guiding for that to continue to be below 25%. I'm just curious what's changed so quickly, that you're targeting below that target, at least it looks like for 2021? And then also, as it relates to the biggest upgrade ever promotion, when we look across the space competitively, obviously AT&T has been doing something similar since the fourth quarter, even T-Mobile did something just yesterday. Do you really look at this as a promotion implying at some point there is an expiration and you pull back from the market? Or, is this really just the new way of competing in today's competitive market and really something that investors should assume in some form or the other is going to be with us for a long period, if not permanently? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I can make a quick answer on the promotion, and Matt will come back. We have already pulled the biggest 5G upgrades on the market. That we did today.\nMatthew Ellis: Today. Today is the wireless day.\nHans Vestberg: Today. So yes, we see it is coming in and out when it's the right moment. But, Matt will probably comment a little bit more on it. On the business side, in Q4, 2018, Matt and I talked about that we think that this is one of the great opportunities we'll have over time with the business side. Remember, we had never consolidated our business side, it was compartmentalize in between all the different businesses we have. Tom and the team have during that moment, and remember, we said we're going to invest in order to see that we have the platforms of products, or CX and UX for our customers to be harmonized in order to be able to scale this to be a good business, and that they are doing and they probably are halfway through it. They're doing a lot of transformation in the business. At the same time, there are some headwinds, as we've seen before. That would be the wireline sort of cyclical -- or no, it's not cyclical, it's a sustained decline. And then, we have a wireless business, where we take more than our fair share. We are leading in all segments. And that balance, of course, is coming into this quarter. Of course, we had more hardware this quarter as well. And then, we're building for the new opportunities with 5G Mobile Edge Compute, private 5G networks, the 5G business internet, which is using fixed wireless access, so we have a lot of new products coming out as we're building. And we have the same ambitions, when it comes to financials, then we will be realistic, what's happening in the market and how the team -- but I'm proud of the team or what they are transforming to, and what we're aspiring for. And seeing the progress on Mobile Edge Compute, and business internet, that's of course, new opportunities that we have not seen coming into the P&L yet, but we're building it together with the transformation we're doing.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah, so just a couple other comments on the business margin there, Colby. So, Hans mentioned the higher volume as we mentioned it upfront that the wireless volumes that we saw the gross ads were not just higher than 2Q last year, also higher than 2Q, \u201819. So certainly seeing volumes come back, especially in enterprise and small, medium business, so that's having some impact there. And then obviously, the wireline pressure, I would expect second-half margins to be reasonably similar to what we saw in the first-half of the year. The business transformation work the team is doing, is having positive impacts with more to come as we go forward here. So, we feel good about the direction the teams headed there, in spite of these secular wireline pressures that we see. And then in terms of your question on promotions, as Hans said, it's a promotion. That means it has both a start date and an end date, and today is the end date. So we've run promotions since the beginning of the wireless industry. They've evolved over time, they will continue to do so. And the great position we're in is because of the strong operational results and financial results. It gives us the ability when the time's right in the marketplace to bring the right promotion out there. We felt this was the right promotion at this time with the economic reopening and wanting to get more customers with a 5G device in their hand, as we're about to launch C-Band within the next six months. So, we will continue to look at what is the right promotion for the right time. But, the underlying operational performance of the business showing up in sequential wireless service revenue increase yet again, gives us the position to have flexibility as we think about how we approach the market.\nColby Synesael: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Colby. That's all the time we have today for questions. Thanks, everybody, and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were exceptional, both financially and operationally. We continue to execute on our strategy, driving contributions from all five growth vectors. We attracted new customers and accounts and delivered low churn amid strong upgrade activity, all of which serves to accelerate 5G adoption in advance with our C-Band deployment later this year. Accelerating volumes contributed to another quarter of strong sequential wireless service revenue growth, building off our industry-leading performance in recent quarters. At the same time, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. Let's go through the details beginning on Slide 6. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $33.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year. Service and other revenue rose 5.7%, driven by strength in wireless, Fios and media. Equipment revenue rose 47.6% year-over-year, given COVID impacted sales a year ago, and was up more than 17% from second quarter 2019 levels, driven by healthy upgrade activity. Total wireless service revenues were up 5.9% year-over-year, and 4.0% compared to second quarter 2019. The results represent sequential growth of $139 million, nearly double our industry-leading sequential growth reported in the first quarter. Total Fios revenues were up 5.4% year-over-year, driven by continued broadband subscriber growth. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion grew 5.6% over the prior year, in line with our service and other revenue growth, despite absorbing approximately $60 million of incremental tower lease costs related to the updated agreements to accelerate the deployment of our C-Band spectrum. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.37, the best on record. The execution of our strategy is translated into record earnings results, and we are well-positioned to continue the momentum into the second-half of the year. Now, let's review our operating segment results, starting with consumer on Slide 7. Momentum built throughout the quarter, and we timed our promotions to take full advantage of the economic recovery and increased customer activity. The result was one of our strongest net new wireless account quarters. With stores fully opened and consumer behavior closer to pre-pandemic levels, we delivered 1.7 million of postpaid phone gross ads in the quarter, up from 1.2 million in second quarter 2020, and almost identical to 2019 levels. Phone churn of 0.65% remained favorable throughout the quarter, and benefited from new offers in the marketplace. This result was a record low for a non-COVID impacted quarter. As a result of phone net ads of 197,000 were our best second quarter for consumer. The response to our differentiated customer proposition, including the broken device trading, and the biggest upgrade ever promotion was terrific. Device upgrades, which was significantly higher compared to both second quarter 2020 and 2019, drove 5G adoption and step-ups to premium unlimited plans, a strong indicator that our strategy is working. We exited the second quarter with approximately 20% of our phone base using 5G capable devices, with the vast majority supporting C-Band. In addition, step-up rates were historically high, and nearly 60% of new accounts opted for a premium unlimited plan, a record high. At quarter-end, approximately 69% of our account base was on unlimited plans, with nearly 27% of our account base on premium unlimited plans. The quality and reliability of our Fios service, combined with the simplicity of our mix and match offerings continues to drive strong demand for broadband. Fios internet net ads totaled 92,000 in the quarter, supported by strong customer retention, and our Fios internet customer base is more than 7% higher than a year ago. Our trailing 12-month total Fios internet net ad performance is the highest since 2015. Now, let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the consumer financial performance. The improved customer activity translated to impressive top-line trends. Total revenue for the quarter grew 11.2% year-over-year, and was also 6.7% higher versus second quarter 2019. Equipment revenue was the biggest driver, rebounding above pre-COVID levels from higher activations, aided by our customer value proposition. Wireless service revenue momentum translated to 5.4% year-over-year growth, and 2.5% growth compared to second quarter 2019. Service revenue is driven by customer growth, step-ups, products such as content, as well as reseller and prepaid. This growth comes despite minimal contributions from international roaming, which we expect should provide a further uptick to growth in future quarters. Momentum in Fios continues with revenues of $2.9 billion, surpassing pre-COVID levels, driven by the continued uptake of gigabit speeds. The results represent our highest revenue results ever. We remain encouraged by the continued margin improvement within Fios, driven by the adoption of mix and match plans and a greater contribution from broadband. Consumer segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 4.9% over 2020, representing an EBITDA margin of 44.3%, down from the prior year, primarily resulting from higher activations. Now, let's move to our business segment on Slide 9. Business wireless activity was highlighted by postpaid gross ads of 1.2 million, up 6.3% over the second quarter 2020, and up 2.1% over the second quarter 2019. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.07%, up 17 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated disconnects from COVID-related purchases in 2020, particularly within the education vertical of public sector. As schools plan for more in-person learning this fall, we expect disconnects to remain elevated in public sector in the third quarter. Despite the disconnect pressures, phone net adds was strong at 78,000, with improving trends in both SMB and enterprise, both of which posted their strongest phone net ads in over a year, offset in the disconnects in public sector. Let's now move to Slide 10, to review the business financial performance. The business segment delivered strong top-line growth with total revenue up 3.7% year-over-year. Equipment revenue, which is up approximately 47% was the primary driver of the increase. Wireless service revenue growth of 8.0% was driven by strong momentum in small and medium business, and the first quarter of enterprise growth since the onset of the pandemic. Public Sector continue to show strong growth over 2020, though is pressured by COVID-related churn in education. The wireless strength was partially offset by declines in business wireline, which returned to a more normal trajectory after elevated COVID-related demand. Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% in the quarter, down approximately 210 basis points year-over-year, mostly driven by higher equipment volumes and wireline pressure. While pressures likely persist in the near-term, the economic reopening, business transformation initiatives and 5G for enterprise provide opportunities to drive margin. Now, let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued its recent trends and delivered strong performance, driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion, up approximately 50% from a year ago, and up 13% from second quarter 2019. Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the first-half of 2021 totaled $20.4 billion, compared with $23.6 billion from the prior year. The change was primarily driven by higher cash taxes and higher working capital requirements due to greater volumes. The cash tax impact was a result of a one-time benefit received in the second quarter of 2020, as well as COVID-related postponements of payments in the year ago period. These expected headwinds were offset by our strong operational results. Capital spending for the first-half of 2021 totaled $8.7 billion, as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G ultra wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $160 million in the first-half, and we have placed orders for approximately $1.4 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us a confidence that we will be within the previously provided $2 billion to $3 billion range for the year. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first-half of the year of $11.7 billion. During the quarter, we began to normalize our cash balance closer to the pre-pandemic levels given the macro environment, and we ended the period with $4.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a sequential change of $5.4 billion. We exited the quarter with unsecured debt of $141.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $6 billion, as we continue to focus on optimizing our debt footprint. Our total borrowing costs in the second quarter were $1.4 billion, which was relatively flat to second quarter 2019 levels, despite having approximately $40 billion in additional debt this year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the first-half was $136.8 billion, and our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9 times. Now, let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. Our strong first-half performance and the momentum in our business gives us the confidence to raise guidance. Please note, that the updated guidance reflects the planning assumption that the Verizon Media sale closes at the end of the third quarter. Starting with revenue, we are raising our wireless service revenue growth outlook to 3.5% to 4%, up from the prior 3% plus. The drivers of the revised outlook are broad based and include positive trends we are seeing for customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services such as cloud and content, as well as prepaid and reseller growth. The anticipated timing of the Verizon Media sale means we would not recognize any revenue from that business in the fourth quarter. As a result, service and other revenue is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with 2020, and we are withdrawing that growth guidance at this time. Turning to earnings, we now expect an adjusted EPS range of $5.25 to $5.35, up from the prior range of $5 to $5.15. The increase is driven by the improved wireless service revenue outlook, the aforementioned media DNA benefit, and a reduction in the expected interest expense related to the C-Band investment. Our guidance for the effective tax rate and CapEx were unchanged. In summary, we're competing effectively and delivering strong volumes, growing accounts, driving healthy step-ups and positioning our base to capitalize long-term, as we grow 5G adoption. Our customer performance has led to quality financial results, as demonstrated by the sequential wireless service revenue growth, while also flow into the bottom line with best on record adjusted EPS. We entered the second-half with a lot of momentum, and I am confident we will continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results, throughout the remainder of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of 2021. Yeah. Thanks, Hans, and thanks for the question, Brett. So, starting with the question about wireless service revenue growth, and as Hans mentioned, it's really building on the momentum that we've seen in the first-half of the year. The continuation of the sequential service revenue growth, we saw that the prior couple of quarters, we saw that increase even further, in the second quarter. We expect that trend to continue as we get into the second-half of the year, because of the operational momentum that Hans mentioned, more step-ups to higher price plans, et cetera, et cetera. In terms of the fees, obviously, the year-over-year component is rather unique this time, as second quarter last year was the most heavily impacted by COVID. And more specifically, for us, of course, we had to keep Americans connected pledge that was in place for all of the second quarter that as you said, impacted some of the fees. As you think about the numbers this year, a good chunk of those are back in. We're more at a BAU level. A couple of items, though that aren't in the numbers yet, obviously, international travel is not back to anywhere close to pre-pandemic levels. I don't expect that to be there, for the balance of this year. Hope there'll be a tailwind as we get into next year, but the guide doesn't make any assumption about an acceleration over return of those fees in the second-half of \u201821. One other thing I'd draw attention to as well, when you look at our numbers, and you think about return of fees, one of the things has been very strong in the first-half of the year is customer payment patterns, which is a great thing to see. And certainly, with all the stimulus payments out there, there's a lot of money in the system, and customers are actually paying more frequently. So, even though, we're back to normal in terms of things like late fees, we're actually charging significantly less than we were in second quarter of '19, because more of our customers are paying on time at this point, which is certainly a trend that we're very happy to see. So, some of the fees are back. But not all of them are back when you think about it. And we're not assuming they will be back in for the balance of the year. The guide is based off of the strong operational momentum in the business, customers stepping up to those higher price plans, and we see that momentum continuing. Your second question about the EPS guidance, and obviously, glad to be able to raise the guidance that's based off having a very healthy business that is performing exceptionally well. As you mentioned, some of the upside to the guidance comes from the media depreciation, amortization, probably about $0.06 to $0.08, depending on the timing of the close. But the majority of its coming from cash items, whether that be the wireless service revenue guide, we were just discussing, but also related to improved expectation around cash interest expense, lower than anticipated at the start of the year. So, most of the guide is driven by cash-related items, and that's of course, based off the strong momentum you see in the business, both operationally and financially. Hey, John. So, as you mentioned, obviously, the higher mix of equipment revenues shows up in the margin percentage. But, I think you also have to look at the margin dollars, which are up sequentially, and also up significantly year-over-year. So, very happy with that performance at the margin line. As you say, when we have a higher equipment revenue, it has an impact on the margin, but I like the combination of volumes and margin that we had in the second quarter. As we head to the second-half of the year with the outline of our -- and the office we have in place that Hans mentioned, combined with new devices coming into the market. As we get closer to 5G launch, the underlying strength in the economy, I would expect that we will see good equipment volumes in the second-half of the year. And I would also expect to see good EBITDA dollars in the second-half of the year to go along with that. C-Band. Simon, one other data point for you, the vast majority of the radios that we need to turn on those 7,000 to 8,000 sites already seeing in our warehouses. So, the supply chain is robust, working very well with our partners. And, obviously a lot of work still to do, but the network teams from where we were in March, after we came out of the auction to where we are today. Their detailed plans in place and they are executing strongly against it. Spectrum clearing is also on track. We stay close to the folks doing everything. We hear from them is that's completely on track as well. Yeah, so just adding to Hans, so obviously, the margin percent will be impacted by the volumes. We saw good volumes in the second quarter. But as Han said, what we're focused on is if you also look in their sequential service revenue growth continue to lead the industry in that, because not all net ads are created equal. And that also come in with EBITDA dollars increasing. So the margin percentage will play out where it does based off the volumes. But we're focused on you have seen that sequential revenue increase, and also the EBITDA dollars flowing in the right direction. In terms of your question around the cost of service, predominantly in consumer, but I think one of the items that we had in the second quarter was a step-up in the network rents and lease of about $60 million a quarter, as a result of the new lease payments we put in place. As you know, under the accounting, you look at the total payments over the life of the lease and kind of flat line irrespective of how the actual cash flow payments flows. So, there was obviously a significant upgrade to our lease agreements. And that was a one-time step-up in the quarterly rate there that flow through the books that's let's say about $60 million, close to a penny a share impact from that, that should be the same going forward now. So that's the biggest driver you're seeing on the cost of service. The vast majority of the wireless network costs are allocated to consumers, some of that is in business, but the majority is in consumer. Obviously, the majority of the customers, the majority of the wireless service revenue is in consumer. And so the costs are going to be allocated largely in line on a similar basis to that. So yes, most of it is in consumer. Absolutely, that's fully baked into the guidance and step-up in that cost. So, that comes back to the underlying strength of the business that we have even with that, that baked in as well. Mike, in terms of your question around the mmWave coverage, we don't really talk about the mmWave coverage. In terms of pops, you heard Hans mentioned upfront that we're on track to seeing 5% to 10% of dense urban usage on our mmWave by the end of the year. That's a combination of more customers having 5G devices in their hands, customer activity moving back to more pre-pandemic levels, and then, obviously, building out more mmWave sites. We said we would do 14,000 sites this year, over 30,000 by the end of the year. I can tell you, we are running well ahead of schedule for the 14,000 sites through the first-half of the year. And so as we do that, we continue to add coverage. And then we said we'd expect to cover 1 million to 2 million homes with mmWave open for sale by the end of the year. And we're on track with all of those items. The build continues \u2013 obviously, we're not going to give guidance for 2022, but everything the network team is doing whether on mmWave, whether on C-Band. And remember, we said we'd be at around 100 million pops during the first quarter next year. We expect still on track to be at that level. So at this point in time, I can't speak more highly about the work the network team is doing as they build, whether it's the fiber that obviously is important to the network, the mmWave expansion, the C-Band expansion and continuing to have the best 4G network out there as well. So, they're doing a tremendous man activity, and they continue to be on both our 2021 plans and our longer-term plans, too. Craig, to your second question, we saw some of our customer base certainly participate in that during the course of the second quarter. I wouldn't say it was a significant impact in our numbers, but we did certainly see our customers participating. Yeah. Hey, Doug, on your first question about the handsets device payment period, we're very comfortable with the offers we have in the marketplace. It's 24-months for a lot of items. Some of the higher priced items, it's a little bit longer just to manage that. But, as you mentioned, the churn is very, very strong. Dot six, five, and consumer for phone shows what we're doing with customers is working very, very effectively. If we feel the need to adjust it, we will do so, but it will be based off of what we see customers need and not be focused on any impact on the accounting treatment associated with it. So, we will continue to be focused on finding the right offers for our customers. And, I think you see from the results in the second quarter, what we're doing is resonating with customers, both from an ad standpoint and also a churn standpoint too. So Peter, on the second part of your question about allocating costs of the spectrum. I've reframed that and actually view it from the standpoint of this is the first time that we've had wireless technology, where we can drive multiple revenue streams off of the same network build, whether that be the mobility, which has obviously been the foundation of 4G, 3G, and everything since the start of wireless. But then the ability to also have fixed wireless access, to also have the public mobile edge compute, all coming off of that same network build, that same network investment, we think gives us the opportunity to provide a very good return on the investment that we've made in both C-Band and mmWave. Kannan, on your other question around the churn, I would say it's a very small number of basis points of benefit coming from the reduction in what we call involuntary churn. And what you're also seeing in the total churn number is actually the benefits of the engagement with the customer, the experience the customer has on the network, the other experiences we bring to that relationship that Hans just touched on, being a bigger piece of the strength in the overall phone churn number that we reported, especially on the consumer side. And in terms of the impact of cost of sales, obviously, the content cost associated with the items that Hans mentioned, do flow through there. And you should expect to see that number continue to be a contributor of that line. But when we look at the overall profitability of bringing that together, the overall customer proposition, it's EBITDA additive to the business, and also brings a better experience to the customers. We see that as a win-win. Today. Today is the wireless day. Yeah, so just a couple other comments on the business margin there, Colby. So, Hans mentioned the higher volume as we mentioned it upfront that the wireless volumes that we saw the gross ads were not just higher than 2Q last year, also higher than 2Q, \u201819. So certainly seeing volumes come back, especially in enterprise and small, medium business, so that's having some impact there. And then obviously, the wireline pressure, I would expect second-half margins to be reasonably similar to what we saw in the first-half of the year. The business transformation work the team is doing, is having positive impacts with more to come as we go forward here. So, we feel good about the direction the teams headed there, in spite of these secular wireline pressures that we see. And then in terms of your question on promotions, as Hans said, it's a promotion. That means it has both a start date and an end date, and today is the end date. So we've run promotions since the beginning of the wireless industry. They've evolved over time, they will continue to do so. And the great position we're in is because of the strong operational results and financial results. It gives us the ability when the time's right in the marketplace to bring the right promotion out there. We felt this was the right promotion at this time with the economic reopening and wanting to get more customers with a 5G device in their hand, as we're about to launch C-Band within the next six months. So, we will continue to look at what is the right promotion for the right time. But, the underlying operational performance of the business showing up in sequential wireless service revenue increase yet again, gives us the position to have flexibility as we think about how we approach the market."

            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. It is remarkable the difference a year can make. We're quickly resuming pre-pandemic norms and at Verizon our network and in-store traffic is almost back to pre-pandemic volumes, and our office employees are gradually going back to office. Of course, some behaviors are changed permanently. The mass shift toward online activity, speed up the timeline for work from home, distant learning, banking, entertainment, telemedicine, et cetera. All of these societal and behavioral shifts have had an impact on the business. And they reaffirm our network as a service strategy and our focus on delivering on our five vectors of growth. Finally, after a year of virtual meetings, I've been spending time in the field with customers and partners, and importantly, with our frontline workers, who have done such heroic work throughout the past year serving our customers. All-in-all, we've a very enthusiastic and cautiously optimistic stakeholder base. As we conclude the first-half of 2021, I have to say, I'm extremely proud of the achievements we have made to strengthen Verizon in all aspects. Let me mention a couple of the milestones. We strengthened our strategic focus with our divestment of Verizon Media Group, which we believe will close around the end of the quarter. We invested in the best portion of the C-Band in order to accelerate and amplify our multipurpose network as a service model. We have also improved our 2.0 organizational structure, and we brought in a diverse slate of top leaders. Our finance and treasury team did an outstanding job of strengthening our balance sheet, with low cost of borrowing and maturity for our debt. We also laid out a long-term financial goal with focus on growth. All this focus on strategy execution and to deliver profitable growth by our teams have paved the way for a continued great financial performance. And in the second quarter, we not only generated our strongest earnings on record, we also produced good growth and profitability in all our units and segments. We demonstrated continued strength in a wireless service revenue growth. And combined with our scale and operational efficiency, we produced 5.6% adjusted to EBITDA growth. Given the strength on our first-half results, we're raising our full year guide, and Matt will provide details later in the call. When it comes to our operations, our recent investments in our customers through the biggest 5G upgrade promotion and innovative trading, coupled with a mix and match for both wireless and Fios customers had led to strong performance across both our offerings. On the network side, we just continue to offer our customer the industry's best network experience. For the 16th consecutive time, RootMetrics awarded Verizon the best overall network performance. And for the 27th consecutive times, JD Power named us the number one network quality. Our C-Band build, we're on track to build 7,000 to 8,000 sites by year-end, and we're on plan to launch the first 46 markets. And we're also strengthening our network by expanding our fixed wireless access reach. If we look to the traffic in the network, the customer activity is near pre-COVID levels. And as mobility traffic comes back, we've seen mmWave uses increase 290% June year-to-date. And as we continue to deploy mmWave sites, and we add more device penetration, we expect these numbers to continue to increase fast, and track towards 5% to 10% of traffic in most dense urban areas by year-end. We're making progress in executing across all our five vectors of growth. On the 5G adoption, approximate 20% of our wireless phone base are now on 5G devices, with a majority of them C-Band capable. In the second quarter the step-up rates were very, very healthy, and this reflects value and differentiated experience for our customers. We also had a record high new accounts that opted for a premium unlimited plan. The Next Generation business application, we launched the first commercially available private 5G network solution in the U.S. It's an on-site, private 5G that brings on-premise 5G capabilities to large enterprises and public sector customers. The team in Verizon business group continued to make very important partnerships, and one of them in the quarter was with Mastercard, where we will work together with Mastercard on 5G Mobile Edge Compute, transforming the contactless payment for consumer as well as small and medium-sized businesses. The customer differentiation that we continue to develop further strengthened in the quarter, when new content and experience to our mix and match platform with a broken device trading, the biggest upgrade ever promotion. And we'll also add through partnership content with Apple Arcade and Google Play pass. Expansion into new markets, we have been focusing continue to have broadband nationwide, and we expanded our 5G Home Services, which is now available across 47 markets. On the 4G home, we expanded to more suburban and urban areas. And it's now available in parts of all 50 states. At the same time we launched a new home router which is compatible with the C-Band. Finally, we have recently expanded our 5G business internet also to parts of 42 cities. In summary, our strategy is working, and it's more relevant than ever, driving value for our investors and to our customers and society, as they embrace new ways of living and working. We have great momentum on all five vector growth, delivering on profit growth with alignment for long-term growth targets. With that, I'll now turn it over to, Matt, to discuss the financial results. Thank you, Matt. At our Investor Day, we laid out commitments for 2021 and beyond to scale our network as a service strategy and generate GDP plus growth. We made transformative investment over the last 12-months through acquisitions, divestiture and customer innovation, and creating a strong platform for growth in the second-half of 2021 and beyond. Our priorities for the second-half, continue to build on our current network and customer initiatives to further amplify and accelerate 5G adoption, further cement our network leadership through industry-leading mmWave and C-Band assets. We expect to close our TracFone and VMG transaction later this year, increasing our focus on what we do best, and bringing innovation and best-in-class customer experience to the value segment. And overall, drive growth across our five vectors with disciplined and customer focused execution. At the end, the great transformation in the first-half, we competed very well in the marketplace, and we're very confident and excited on our opportunities ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Brady for the Q&A. I can start and Matt will fill in. But I think that on the service revenue, I think you've seen the last four quarters right now how the team has done a fantastic job to differentiate our offerings, all the way to see that our customers are doing step-ups, they're taking down limited premium. And as Matt said, there have been 60% of the new accounts in the quarter was taking a limited premium. The penetration 5G is happening. So we just continue -- the team we're growing on the consumer side, if we talk about that. They have these more than we've added for several years, where we do the mix and match. We have a differentiation and it is clearly resonating in the market. And at the same time, we see, of course, they call them and calling back, the stores are getting almost back to pre-pandemic. So, all in all, it's a good timing for us and that's also why we feel good about our guidance, and how the service revenue is growing. And remember, we're always focused on profitable growth. That's what the team is doing. If Matt and I see opportunities, we support the team to do it, but as long as it's going to be a profitable growth. And that's what we're seeing right now, with all the momentum in the market. The team is taking advantage of that. And that also translates back to the guidance. But, all in all, I would say this is our strategy, we've been having for a couple of years and has been very successful. Matt? Yeah. As I said before, we have this formula right now that we've had since we launched unlimited, with both mix and match, and then our value proposition that we have done. And you saw in the second quarter, that now we added also gaming with good traction with both Google and Apple gaming. And this is a unique model for us. At the same time, of course, we have excitement around 5G, what we have in our network is performing extremely well. So, I think that our team, they have a very, very good model for continuing this. I think, I said it in the first quarter, it will become more of this value proposition and differentiation. And yes, it came, we went into gaming. So, I say it again, I have a lot of confidence in the team in Ronan's team to continue to come up with things that our customer loves, and using our distribution, our network and a brand to continue to grow this. And that is the whole strategy. Remember, the five vectors of growth, we're playing in all five of them, and that's why we are also confident all of our long-term guidance without a doubt. And you see part that in this quarter that we already are executing on all of these vectors. Thanks. When it comes to broadband in general, that was brought up on our vision as we have outlined, we want to be a nationwide broadband provider, and we're going to use to access technology that is best suited for our customers in a mix of everything from fiber to 4G to 5G mmWave, C-Band, and all of that. And this quarter, we'll open up even more opportunities for that. We will open more 5G home markets, we will open more 4G home markets. And then of course, as Matt outlined as well, we took more Fios' subscribers than ever in the last three, four quarters. So this is playing out well for us. We're opening up all of that. We are very excited about what's going to happen in the second-half with a new CP that has C-Band as well. So, we executed everything we said we should do in the Investor Day, in the second quarter. And we look forward to the second-half of this year, and we will continue the report out what we're doing. The second question, I think that we're open for business, but we don't comment on any particular deals in a market or something like that. But we are happy with the customers we have on our MNO. So, on the TracFone, I think nothing has changed since we outlined or we proposed acquisition. It's tracking according to plan with a process that we need to go through. The team is responding to all the questions we have. So it's going to be in the latter part on the second-half of the 2021, as we thought all the time. So, nothing strange, it's actually on track. But that's where we are. Second question was... C-Band, yeah. The 7,000 to 8,000 sites, yeah, we can definitely say we're on track. When we reported the first quarter, we had just started everything. Now we feel we have a full funnel in the supply chain. The guys in our supply chain done a great job with our partners. We have all the gears we need to deploy the 7,000 to 8,000, and our team executing very well. So, we feel very good about being able to have 7,000 to 8,000 sites up by year-end. And when it comes for the long-term, I mean, we have the same ambitions as before, we haven't changed those, and we continue to execute. So, we will do it as fast as we can, given the different types of milestones that are involved in the spectrum. But, so far, we are executing on that plan, and we're on or ahead on the plan of executing right now for the end of the year. When it comes to the consumer group, and Matt explained a little bit why the margin is lower, because the hardware part of it is included there. And we think it's a good sign on what's happening in the market. I would say David, we constantly think about profitable growth and that has been our strategy as long as I have been here. And Ronan and team, they think about that. But of course, if they see an opportunity, as we saw when the traffic came back into stores, and they call them it's coming back, we did some offerings in this quarter, which was good timing. And we will continue to support Ronan, where we see he has a good solution for the market and our customers are going to love it. And I can tell you, our differentiation is really resonating with the market and that's what you see in the second quarter. And we will come back and see if there's something he wants to do in the second-half. But clearly, we're focused on profitable growth and we want to have -- we are writing high-quality business in high-quantity. That's what we want to do. And I think you see that coming through in these results. Thank you. No, of course, we see some changes in behavior when it comes to our customers. But, we had already started building our omni-channel that our customer can start on the web, and they can end in the store, or they can start in the store and on the phone, and all of that in order to see that they will do these as seamless as possible. But clearly, we see much more digital than before. But also, when the economy came back and the vaccinations in the United States were coming up on high levels, we also saw the traffic coming back into stores. So we've had, I would say all our stores opened in the second quarter, and we see much more foot traffic than we have seen in the previous quarters. Not really back to pre-pandemic days, but clearly, fairly close. So, we think our customers still going to want to come into a store and see our technology and our products, but they might be wanting to finish the delivery and the purchase in a digital format. And that's how we build our store. So we're working very closely to see that the new behaviors that we can meet that's where our customers really feel good about dealing with us, and I think that our team are doing a great job in that area. Hey, when it comes to specific deals in the market, we don't comment on that. And apparently, this is something that AT&T won from T-Mobile, so I cannot comment on our involvement in itself or not. But as I said, we're open for business. We have a natural strategy model, which is paying off well for us with the five vectors of growth, and part of that is monetization of MNOs and we're very happy what we have. Yeah, I can start with the C-Band. For obvious reason, we think it's an important moment. We are both amplifying and accelerating our 5G in the network, amplifying the opportunity. However, given away our commercial ideas when we're going to launch this right now we wouldn't do that. But, of course, we are excited over it. We think it's going to be great for our customer, it's going to be fantastic performance and it expands our 5G mobility options, our 5G fixed wireless access options, and it also extends our 5G Mobile Edge Compute options. So, it's just playing straight into our strategy. So we are excited over it. And we will come back how we will bring that to our customers, so they are equally delighted as they are with our network today, but it's getting something that is so much superior than anybody else. Okay. On the first one, if you've been listening to what I've talked about around 5G before, first of all, 5G as a technology is better to handle data than 4G. And that's obvious, it really is better than 4G as well. So that's happening. Then you need to add to that -- you're not only talking about spectrum, you're talking about how you engineer and how you build the network. So in our case, of course, we see great opportunities for being able to handle much more data. And remember, today on the mmWave, we might use 400, sometimes 800 megahertz, but not more, and we have 1600 megahertz nationwide. So, there's so much more we can do. And as Kyle showed at the Investor Day, our headroom in the network is bigger than before. And that's before we start building what we're building right now. So we feel really confident how many ex we are doing. And remember, our 4G is already the best in the nation. And then we are adding up right now what we're doing in 5G that is also extraordinary good. So others can talk and we usually execute, and we will continue with that. I can, and Matt will talk about no-paid churn. When it comes to the content deal, I think I've said it a couple of times now. Our whole idea is to offering exclusive offers for our wireless customers. And we also want to offer that partnership to brands that we really think resonate with us. And the model, as we've spoken about before is that this is incremental revenue for us. It's not only loyalty, it's actually incremental profit for us.  So it's a totally different model that might sometimes not been in the market before, because suddenly, we use the best network, the best distribution and the best brand to work with companies like Disney Plus, et cetera, to give our customers a premium experience, on top of the differentiation we're already have with a mix and match. And ultimately, when we make these customers to paying customers, we get our fair share of that, because we with our assets have created it together with the asset for Disney Plus, Discovery or gaming et cetera. So that's how the model is working. And as I said before, we're very pleased with it. I think we've six or seven of these offerings in the market right now and all of them are very positive to us and to our customers. And we will continue to see if we can find more. I think it's a unique model that we have created that nobody else has in the market. And as I said, again, it goes back to Ronan and the team being very, very innovative and creative to see that we bring the best to our customer, not only the best network, but also the differentiation in offering. So I have to say I'm very pleased with that. And as I said, we've more in the funnel. I can make a quick answer on the promotion, and Matt will come back. We have already pulled the biggest 5G upgrades on the market. That we did today. Today. So yes, we see it is coming in and out when it's the right moment. But, Matt will probably comment a little bit more on it. On the business side, in Q4, 2018, Matt and I talked about that we think that this is one of the great opportunities we'll have over time with the business side. Remember, we had never consolidated our business side, it was compartmentalize in between all the different businesses we have. Tom and the team have during that moment, and remember, we said we're going to invest in order to see that we have the platforms of products, or CX and UX for our customers to be harmonized in order to be able to scale this to be a good business, and that they are doing and they probably are halfway through it. They're doing a lot of transformation in the business. At the same time, there are some headwinds, as we've seen before. That would be the wireline sort of cyclical -- or no, it's not cyclical, it's a sustained decline. And then, we have a wireless business, where we take more than our fair share. We are leading in all segments. And that balance, of course, is coming into this quarter. Of course, we had more hardware this quarter as well. And then, we're building for the new opportunities with 5G Mobile Edge Compute, private 5G networks, the 5G business internet, which is using fixed wireless access, so we have a lot of new products coming out as we're building. And we have the same ambitions, when it comes to financials, then we will be realistic, what's happening in the market and how the team -- but I'm proud of the team or what they are transforming to, and what we're aspiring for. And seeing the progress on Mobile Edge Compute, and business internet, that's of course, new opportunities that we have not seen coming into the P&L yet, but we're building it together with the transformation we're doing."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates discussed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.27 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from a special item of approximately $223 million related to the sale of certain wireless licenses. Excluding the effects of this special item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the first quarter.  On April 8, we announced a recall process for approximately 2.5 million Jetpack units, which impacted some customers enrolled in our distance learning programs. The overall impact included within consolidated operating income was approximately $160 million during the quarter, split between $100 million in the business segment and the remaining $60 million in consumer. The impact included within reported and adjusted earnings per share was $0.03 in the first quarter.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter. \nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Brady, and welcome to all to this first quarter earnings call. We marked more than one year since the devastating effects of COVID-19. While we see significant progress in vaccination, customer sentiment and recover our economy, there is still a lot to go before we're back to normal.  I'm proud how Verizon has responded during this period for all our stakeholders as we have executed on our balanced stakeholder-driven strategy. And as I said, during the worst period of the pandemic, Verizon will come out stronger as a company when this is over.  During the last 12 months, we have progressed all our positions with customers, employees, and added great assets to an already strong position. And today, we stand stronger than ever to compete in a market and serve our customers.  Looking back on the quarter, we amplified and accelerated our strategy through our average 160 megahertz nationwide position in C-Band. And as we laid out in our Investor Day, the combination of C-Band and our millimeter wave places us in a unique position of strength to execute on all 5G opportunities, 5G Home, 5G mobility and 5G mobile edge compute. On top of that, we have all our five vectors of growth in place, together with our network leadership and a strong network as a service foundation.  And the progress we made in the quarter confirms that our strategy is working. We had growth in all our businesses for the first time since the launch of Verizon 2.0. We had growth in both EPS and cashflow.  With all this work by our great team, we have a head start in the post-COVID era, with a clear and differentiated strategy, diverse go-to-market models, network leadership, industry-leading partner ecosystem and a strong brand, all of which together provides a great platform and foundation to achieve our growth targets for 2021 and beyond. Let me talk about some of the highlights from the first quarter. Our network team continues to do great things by leading the network performance in the market, as well as deploying more assets than ever before \u2013 millimeter wave, C-Band, 4G, 5G and fiber. I have a lot of confidence that this team will accelerate our network leadership.  Our unique Mix & Match model continues to deliver with the migration to unlimited and unlimited premium in the quarter, as well as building on our exclusive offerings like Disney+ and the most recent Discovery+ that was launched earlier in the quarter. And we're pleased with the Discovery+ with the current enrollment rates we've seen so far.  Our brand and responsible business framework, Citizen Verizon, continue to set standards in the industry. Verizon was recognized by Fast Company as the sixth most innovative company in the Corporate Social Responsibility earlier this quarter. Brand Finance recognized us as the most valuable telecom brand. Within ESG, we have ambitious goals, such as our commitment to be net zero in the carbon emission by 2035. Our longstanding focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is evidenced by the fact that we have 100% pay equity by gender globally and by race ethnicity in the United States. And earlier this week, we also launched our 2020 ESG report. We continue with a high level of deployment on millimeter wave and fiber in the quarter and we're on the track to deliver on our operational targets for the year.  We brought 5G service to several additional cities. We currently have 30 5G home and 67 5G mobility cities live and more to come. We recently signed our first European private 5G deal with Associated British Ports. We also expanded our 5G edge partnership with AWS, with private 5G and edge computing to our customers.  We continue to scale our network as a service strategy across new markets and verticals through a diverse set of partnerships. We have partnered with leading brands across diverse verticals, such as Honda to innovate connected and autonomous driving; Deloitte and SAP to create a 5G and edge computing retail digital platform that will provide retailers with real-time operations data; and Dreamscape and Arizona State University to build and commercialize immersive learning and training.  At our Investor Day, we shared with you our plans and commitment for C-Band and Ultra Wideband deployment, which continues to progress well. Our intent is to invest $10 billion of incremental C-Band CapEx to accelerate the integration on this capacity into our network.  We recently signed deals with Crown Castle and SBA to accelerate our C-Band deployment and look forward to providing further updates on the build status throughout the year.  We have already ordered half of the total network equipment needed from our 5G suppliers to support C-Band deployments in 2021. And the satellite operators are on track to clear the spectrum between third and fourth quarter of 2021 for the first tranche of spectrum.  In addition, we continue to expand our Ultra Wideband coverage in Q1. We deployed 3,600 new Ultra Wideband sites. And to date, we have close to 21,000 sites on air and on track to reach 30,000 by the end of this year.  One Fiber formed the strategic backbone of our intelligent edge network, and we continue to expand fiber deployment. And to date, we have deployed more than 42,000 route miles.  We were also pleased with the low rates we achieved for long-term financing of this critical strategic investment. We view the record investor demand as supportive of our strategy and our financial discipline.  Lastly, we were also very proud to offer prominent roles to nine diversity and inclusion financial firms as part of the $25 billion financing.  As I outlined earlier, our investments in our network and customers are generating solid revenue growth across all three of our operating groups. Our success in Mix & Match continue to drive uptake of unlimited plans and higher ARPA, supporting year-over-year growth of 2.4% in wireless service revenue, up from 2.2% in the fourth quarter last year. Ronan and the team closed out Q1 with strong momentum. And I'm excited to see their Q2 performance now that almost all our stores have reopened. In addition, we see solid growth in Fios and with Fios Internet reporting the best first quarter net adds in six years.  Additionally, Verizon Media Group continued to contribute meaningful growth, including the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year on the top line.  With that, let me ask Matt to provide some deeper insight to the financial of the first quarter.\nMatthew Ellis : Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. As Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, the first quarter has been a truly exciting and transformative period for our company.  I am pleased to report that we're off to an excellent start for the year based on our strong operational and financial performance. We are seeing continued strength in our core business with traction across all five of our growth vectors, driving higher revenues and increased demand for our products and services.  With the positive momentum exiting the first quarter and the ongoing recovery of business activity, we are highly confident that our actions in the marketplace will deliver strong results throughout the year.  In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $32.9 billion, up year-over-year by 4.0%. High quality sustainable wireless service revenue growth, a recovery in wireless equipment revenues, strong Fios momentum, and excellent digital advertising trends resulted in revenue growth across consumer, business and media.  Total wireless service revenues were up 2.4% year-over-year, an acceleration from the 2.2% year-over-year growth that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Additional details on total wireless performance are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website.  Total Fios revenues were up 2.5% year-over-year, driven by the strong broadband volumes in recent quarters. Our portfolio of mobility and broadband products and services continues to lead the industry, delivering value to our customers. And we are well positioned to maintain and expand our leadership position as we enter new markets and broaden our offerings and network capabilities.  I'm extremely proud of the team's execution of our Business Excellence Program over the past three years. At the end of the first quarter, we achieved our cumulative cash savings goal of $10 billion, well ahead of our year-end 2021 target. We will realize additional benefits moving forward from the ways we've improved our operating systems and procedures. As we've said previously, we will create additional savings opportunities on a continuous basis beyond this program.  The strong revenue performance across our three business segments for the quarter, combined with our best-in-class cost structure and disciplined focus on the business, delivered adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion, which represents growth of 2.0% over the prior year. The Jetpack recall had a 50 basis points impact to adjusted EBITDA margin during the quarter.  Brady highlighted the adjusted EPS for the first quarter at $1.31. The growth of 4.0% reflects the strength in our core business and sets the stage for Verizon to fully capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace, while giving us excellent momentum relative to our full-year year adjusted EPS guidance.  Now, let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. This quarter, we continued to see excitement around our unlimited offerings, 5G capabilities, Mix & Match value proposition and our best-in-class Fios broadband services. All of this is part of our customer differentiation strategy, which drives deeper and broader relationships with our customers.  Starting with wireless, we had total postpaid activations of 6.4 million for the quarter, up approximately 14% compared to the same period last year, made up of approximately 2.3 million gross adds and 4.1 million upgrades.  First quarter seasonality drove phone net losses of 225,000, which included the last major cohort of disconnects of approximately 90,000 phones related to our Keep America Connected program. Early in the quarter, wireless in-store sales were again tempered by our COVID safety protocols as we saw elevated levels of store closures and limited foot traffic. Beginning in March, the improved COVID environment allowed for almost all of our stores to be open. Not surprisingly, we saw our best volume of the quarter in March, producing positive phone net adds in a month. The strong March momentum combined with our new innovative promotional offers positions us well for the second quarter.  We continue to be pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting. Similar to last quarter, over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan and over 50% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter-end, over 65% of our base was on an unlimited plan, with more than 23% of our base taking a premium plan. We have plenty of room to continue to expand these penetration rates and believe that they will grow alongside our 5G adoption rates, which currently resides at 14% of our consumer postpaid phone base.  5G adoption and the customer differentiation associated with our premium and unlimited plans will further benefit our retention efforts, which remains strong in Q1 with phone churn of 0.77% for the quarter. We continue to take a balanced and cost effective approach to customer retention with strong NPS scores, best-in-class network performance and strong value proposition, leading to our excellent levels of customer retention.  Turn into Fios, we posted our third consecutive quarter of strong growth and high take rates for our best-in-class broadband products, with consumer Fios internet net adds of 98,000, well ahead of the first quarter 2020 performance of 59,000.  Total Fios Internet net adds of 102,000 was the best first quarter performance in six years. This reflects both the quality of the product as well as the positive sentiment around our Mix & Match phone pricing structure, which provides our customers with unmatched simplicity and optionality.  Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the consumer financial performance. The higher phone activations in the quarter were the major driver of the 4.7% increase in operating revenues to $22.8 billion.  The continued adoption of our unlimited and premium unlimited plans drove over 1.5% increase in consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter of $13.7 billion. This growth comes even as Travel Pass and our international roaming revenues remain at subdued levels. Strong Internet volumes drove the 2.2% increase in consumer Fios revenue to $2.9 billion.  While we continue to experience revenue pressure associated with secular video trends, our broadband subscriber growth combined with a shift up in speed tiers more than offset that pressure and will continue to drive solid revenue performance for us.  Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.8% to $10.4 billion. The EBITDA margin was 45.5% in the quarter, down 90 basis points from the prior year due to higher volumes, which drove increased equipment revenues and associated costs, as well as the Jetpack recall, which had approximately 30 basis points of impact on EBITDA margin for the quarter.  Now, let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Our Business team continues to lead the industry towards next generation B2B applications. Hans referenced some of their accomplishments from the prior 90 days, including announcements on MEC and private 5G.  In addition, we launched Verizon Frontline, our branding for our advanced network and technology we deliver for first responders. Being the wireless market share leader for public safety and in all of our other customer groups puts us in an ideal position with our customers to be their digital transformation partner of choice.  Business wireless trends continued their strong momentum in the first quarter of 2021. Postpaid activations were 2 million, with total net adds of 156,000, including 47,000 phones. Remember that Q1 of last year benefited from the COVID related bulk purchases, providing much of the variance for the year-over-year change in gross to net adds.  Public sector demand remains strong, even as distance learning programs settle into a more normal pattern of buying activity. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, as the team continues to make progress in supporting local businesses as they position for an improving environment. As more stores reopened in early March, not only did consumer volumes see a lift, SMB volumes benefited as well, an encouraging sign for the rebound.  Our enterprise team continues to assist our customers in their digital transformation and unlock the potential of 5G. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, an improvement of 1 basis point over the prior year. Our strong churn performance reflects the strength and reliability of our network, combined with the full suite of services and solutions that we provide.  Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the business financial performance. The high demand for our services and our brand reputation for reliable connectivity has translated into healthy revenue growth with Verizon Business group.  Operating revenues for the Business segment was $7.8 billion, up 1.3% year-over-year, the highest rates of growth since the creation of the Business segment in the Verizon 2.0 structure. This growth highlights the success of our business transformation process as strong wireless service growth of 6.2% offset secular pressure in wireline.  Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, down approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. The Jetpack recall mentioned earlier had a more pronounced impact on the Business segment, reducing EBITDA margins by about 130 basis points.  Now, let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continues to deliver strong performance driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms.  Total revenue for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up approximately 10.4% from a year ago, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends, growing 26%, including 45% growth in DSP revenues. Revenue from our owned and operated brands grew 13% compared to the same period last year.  We saw continued high consumer engagement with strength in sports and finance, as daily active users grew 22% and 8% respectively from the prior year.  Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.7 billion, up approximately $0.9 billion from the prior year, driven by our continued operational discipline and net benefits from our liability management activities, which lowered borrowing rates from last year.  Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $4.5 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. This includes approximately $40 million for C-Band related items.  As a result, free cash flow for the quarter was $5.2 billion, up 46% year-over-year. We made payments of $45 billion in the first quarter to the FCC for C-Band spectrum won at the recently completed Auction 107.  To finance this purchase, we raised over $31 billion in March, in addition to the $12 billion raised in Q4. The weighted average maturity of these C-Band borrowings was 17 years, and we achieved a very attractive average cost of funding of 2.5%, benefiting from record order books for our US dollar offerings.  We are delighted that the credit rating agencies considered the spectrum asset purchases as strategic and critical to our business operations and held their rating levels unchanged. The success in the capital markets is a result of our disciplined capital allocation policy, coupled with our consistent track record of delivering on our commitments made to our investors.  We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $137.4 billion and our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9 times. Based on our current cash flow assumptions, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 2.8 times by the end of the year. We will evaluate the level of our cash balance based on the recovery in the economy and developments with the pandemic.  Now, let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. As Hans mentioned in his opening remarks, we're on track to achieve our guidance for the year, which remains unchanged. Reaffirming our comments from the Investor Day last month, we expect no material impact to our adjusted earnings per share guidance from our C-Band program for this year. We do expect C-Band related capital spending to be between $2 billion to $3 billion for 2021, and we will provide updates on the quarterly earnings calls.  With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2021.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Matt. Let me sum this up in a couple of easy buckets. First of all, our strategy is unchanged. Our focus is clear. We're going to accelerate our multi-purpose network strategy, including the C-Band that were required. We're going to focus on amplify and accelerate the five vectors of growth. And we're going to see with that that we're going to deliver on our 2021 commitments both operationally and financially.  And as I said earlier, I feel really good about our position and the team that I have that they will deliver on that.  With that, I hand it over to Brady. \nBrady Connor : Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, you may go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hans, could we get your thoughts on the competitive landscape now and maybe whether the new pricing from Comcast or any other competitive development sort of affects your view of the return to growth in terms of postpaid phone net adds here in the second quarter. From your - the last slide there, it looks like that you expect some nice acceleration.  And then secondly, there's potentially just a massive amount of federal stimulus money flowing into broadband infrastructure deployment over the next year or two. I realize we're very early in the process and the rules aren't laid out yet. But do you think Verizon is in a position to capture some of those funds as you sort of continue your heavy spending on Ultra Wideband deployment? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, John. On the competitive situation, I mean, as you have seen yourself, it is a competitive market and it's been for quite a while. But with our model, I can see that we are actually winning in any case because with our growth trajectory that we have in all our businesses and a unique model, especially on the consumer side with the Mix & Match, the value proposition, and you saw in the quarter, we continue to do that. And \u2013 but also, as Matt mentioned, it was a little bit light in the beginning of the quarter because of stores that were closed, et cetera. And then we saw a very good sort of strength in our port ratios and our growth in the end of the quarter because we have all the stores open. So, we look forward to the second quarter and the second part of the year. And as Ronan said when we had the Investor Day, we believe we're going to have a good second part of the year. Second quarter is really close to us. And what we've seen so far, we feel good about it. So, again, we have an overall strategy in order to address the market for consumer that is really working with this step up, the migrations and all of that. So, in general, we feel good about it. The team is doing well. You saw we came out with a new promo as well. And we've always had lots of financial discipline. We do this because we know we can actually capture market at the good high-quality customers.  On the infrastructure, as I said, this is in the planning stages. So, it's hard to say if this is true or not. So - but on the other hand, I think that what we are telling the administration is, of course, that accessibility, affordability and usability are the three buckets to address the digital divide.  And when it comes to accessibility, we have to recognize \u2013 and I worked in 180 countries with networks, that the networks during the COVID-19 in the U.S., they were really working well. There were basically no major issues at all. They could deliver even though traffic moved around. So, I think that what we are advocating for, we want that private sector continue to invest in the network and leading that charge and then having government work more with the affordability of it. So, we have plans that meets all needs for all different customer segments in the market. So, that's what we're advocating for. That's the same as BRT is advocating for as well. We don't think that any price regulation would be \u2013 that will be counterproductive to the market. So, in general, again, it's very early on. I mean, it's a plan that has not been approved and submitted, but at least we're advocating together with BRT and with ourselves what we think should be the right.  Matt, any more comments on the competitive landscape?\nMatthew Ellis: No, I think you touched on the key points, Hans. The only other thing I'd add is you mentioned the strong momentum coming out of margin to the quarter. You add that with the promotion that we put in place at the start of the month that we think is an innovative promotion that's addressing a customer pain point that nobody else has addressed in the past. We're seeing good traction on that in the early days of that. So, certainly feel good about the momentum heading into the quarter on the volume side. When you add that in with the financial performance we saw in the first quarter, it was set up nicely for 2Q and the rest of the year.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, John. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. You had another strong quarter with Fios Internet. Perhaps you could just give us a little bit of insight into the sustainability of that. Obviously, 2020 was a great year in terms of broadband demand. But you seem to be sustaining that into this year. Is this share? Is this incremental marketing opportunities? And what's happening with the speed up-tiering there? And maybe related to that on 5G home, you've had a number of announcements here recently. I know we're headed to 15 million households. But what's the latest on the ground today? And what should we expect through the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Simon. Yes, we had good Fios quarter again. I mean, overall, I think the broadband is in demand and our high-quality Fios, of course, a great opportunity for us to expand on them. We \u2013 I think personally, that this will continue. The demand for broadband will continue. We are just starting a total revolution of using technology, which is scalable and sustainable in the post era of the COVID. So - and we are great position. And that also is going to help me tremendously when we come with 5G Home or millimeter wave and C-Band and all that because we know how to deal with home broadband. And that is an advantage we have to any others that is trying to do fixed wireless access and we've been on to it for a long time.  And as we saw as well, now we're up to over 30 markets with 5G Home, I mean, adding some 20 very recently. So, we're on fire on this right now. We have a very big belief in our 5G Home. And then, later the year, when C-Band comes, we're going to add even more coverage on that. And all is embedded in our work with the ecosystem from the from the beginning and how we have developed our own IPRs on how to do self-install, how to do all the sort of grids when it comes to millimeter wave and having a great opportunity to see that our customer gets a fantastic service.  So, all in all, this is a full package that we are bringing to the market in order to have a full scale broadband for the country. I think it's absolutely the right moment. But don't forget, on the business side as well, we now - it's called 5G Internet on the business side. We are using the same methodology. We are doing the scaling on the same platforms and we address another market with it. It goes back to a strategy that we had for all the time. We have a network service and we scale it with different customers. And that scale will help us with growth. But it also means that with the platform thinking we have, that will fall to the bottom line. And if you see in this quarter, all three units are growing and we're bringing it to all to bottom line and we still have more to do. And - but we know how to do it and we'll have the model. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nBrady Connor: Yes, great. Thanks, Simon. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So earlier this week, you announced that you had officially commenced the deployment of your C-Band licenses and that you would expect 100 million POPs to be covered by at least 60 megahertz as we get into March of next year. Equally important to creating that coverage is making sure your customer base is able to use that capacity, which is going to require a fairly significant handset upgrade cycle. You noted that you had just put a new promo into the market this quarter. How are you thinking about stimulating device upgrades over the course of the year? What's embedded in your guidance in terms of maybe doing more of this? And then, just as a follow-up question, you had noted you do expect that the phase one spectrum will be cleared by 3Q, 4Q, but it seems like you don't expect to be fully utilizing it until March. So, there's a bit of a gap. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can do to close out or that's just what the supply chain can deliver right now? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: First of all, I can only say that we are on to a false start on the C-Band. It's only some six weeks ago since we can start to talk to our employees, we could talk to the partners, we can talk to the satellite companies, our suppliers [indiscernible]. We have already ordered half of the equipment. We have made agreement with the tower cos. We have talked to the satellite companies that has reaffirmed that they believe that they can clear this first tranche of the spectrum in third quarter and fourth quarter. And we actually made a press release yesterday that we're now starting deploying C-Band as well, and that's six weeks. So, the technology was on fire to make this happen.  And as said when we had our investor day, we said that we worked with the date we got from the FCC because we hadn't talked to anybody. Right now, this is the best dates we have. And of course, we are pushing as much as possible to see that we get this up for our customers as soon as possible in order to get a great experience.  And then flowing that over to the to the phone question. I think that we have seen a great uptake on 5G phones and unlimited premium. And as Matt said, in the quarter, over 20% of the unlimited new customers took unlimited premium. That tells you there's a lot of value in it and a lot of 5G in it. And with the new promo that Matt talked about, we believe that is going to also drive 5G. So, we believe that what we have in the market right now will continue to grow the 5G base. And as said, this is going faster than what we saw in 4G. So, we will continue to monitor, of course. But we see a good uptake on it.  And we can also add that, when it comes to the iPad that have been just recently launched, it's also another addition of mmWave and how that comes into the whole ecosystem. So, again, we feel good about the uptake and we feel good about the line of products we have. And we have the promo supporting it. So, that's going to also make it go well together with the C-Band deployment coming later this year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan.\nPhil Cusick: I wonder if you can dig into the enterprise and small business results. S&P was up year to year which is great to see. And I'm curious what you see in bookings versus growing revenue this quarter?\nHans Vestberg:\nTami:\nTami:\nPhil Cusick: Is there any impact here from the One Fiber initiative? Is that helping at all on the enterprise or SMB side? Or is it still too early for them?\nHans Vestberg: I think on the enterprise side, of course, we have some opportunities with the fiber. But remember, our priorities was clear. It's getting fiber to our 4G and our 5G network. That's really where we can get the most bang for the buck. And then we do [indiscernible] enterprise when we have them.  On the small and medium, that's going to take some time. That's what I said before. But now, when we have the 5G Internet, we will actually have fixed wireless access, we have a really good product for small and medium businesses. So, some possibility on enterprise, but they are also still to come. As was said, it's more focused on building the network with fiber, right, so we can see that our customer gets the experience that they need to have when it comes to our exceptionally great 5G with mmWave and C-Band.\nMatthew Ellis: Still just to follow-on on that, it is part of, as Hans mentioned previously, about building the network once and then monetizing it different ways. Just as we talk about with wireless and 5G, monetizing it in different ways, with the fiber, we have the same opportunity too. So, once you \u2013 as you're lighting up those cell sites, when you go past an enterprise building, the opportunity to go in there and have more customers or enterprise customers on net rather than paying a third-party access absolutely is an opportunity for us to create incremental return on that investment in fiber. So, again, another example of multi-use network.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. \nDavid Barden: I guess the first one on the Fios revenue. We saw pretty strong pickup. I know that kind of on a year-over-year basis, there's been a mix shift and an uptake on the higher speed of broadband services, but sequentially it was a big number. I'm wondering if you guys did something on price on the broadband or even on the video that would have contributed to that move.  And then the second question, I guess, Matt, you guys threw out a lot of numbers out on Media, 26% advertising growth, 13% owned property growth, 10.4% total revenue growth. Could you kind of break that down what the moving parts are kind of dragging down some of those bigger, higher eye-popping numbers? And is this kind of a one year level set over a depressed 2020 and we're going to return to some kind of more \"normal\" revenue growth pattern in 2022? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: If I start with the Fios revenue, what you're really seeing here is the impact of what the team started in the first quarter last year. We introduced Mix & Match into our Fios offering. It's been great for our consumer business. We introduced it into Fios in first quarter last year. Obviously, the initial benefit we were seeing there got interrupted as the pandemic got underway. But we now have three quarters of very strong volumes, starting in third quarter last year, fourth quarter and now again in the first quarter here, our best first quarter in total Fios' six years.  And so, what that means is you've got an Internet base of customers in Fios that's now more than 5% higher than it was a year ago. And so, that's driving the revenue growth even as you have the secular pressures coming on the video side. It's really volume created as much as step-ups or anything else, although there are obviously step-ups in there and opportunities to move customers to gigabit service and so on. But the strong volumes based off the quality of service, combined with bringing the Mix & Match there, has worked very well for us in consumer mobility, now working well for us in Fios. And as you saw, we brought the Mix & Match construct into our SMB wireless offerings as well. So, very excited about what that's going to do.  On the Media revenue side, as you say, the 10.4%, up double digits for the second consecutive quarter, you remember both fourth quarter and now first quarter aren't really lapping COVID impacted quarters. So, what you're seeing here is the benefit of the hard work the team's been doing over the past couple of years. And that's really showing up on the advertising trends, as we talked about there. Offsetting that, to your question, how do you get from those higher numbers down to the 10%, things like search revenue continue to be a headwind and will likely continue to be so. But we're very encouraged by the advertising and the O&O momentum that we have. And as you say now, that's not a one year thing as we go forward. The team's gaining some good momentum. Hans?\nHans Vestberg: I just want to reiterate on the Verizon Media Group again. If we go back to where we started the strategy in 2018, we reset the business plan and we start to cut costs, then we reshaped all the products all the way from the owned and operated. And all the OO brands, we combined the ad platform. The work has been immense by the Verizon Media Group team. And now we see sort of the fruits of that hard work with growth in two consecutive quarters with double digits. So, I just want to shout out to the team that this was the plan we set and they are actually delivering on the plan. So, I think we have a great future with these guys. They have clearly a good product portfolio. And digital is going to be important in the future. So by that, I think we're in a good position. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. \nMichael Rollins: I was curious if we could go back to one of the comments you made earlier about Verizon reaching the cumulative cost cutting target of $10 billion. And if you could unpack that in terms of how much have that helped the EBITDA versus the CapEx side of the investment process for Verizon? And then, maybe secondly, how should investors think about the pace going forward of what incremental cost cutting can \u2013 like for Verizon over the next three to five years? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Look, I'm incredibly proud of the team's efforts over the past three plus years now as we've really lent in on identifying ways to continue to make us more efficient and maintain our position having the best cost structure in the industry, which we think is going to continue to be important going forward, obviously. In terms of your first question, there is a split between both CapEx and P&L items behind the $10 billion. It's roughly even between those two, where you see that come from. So on the CapEx side, that means we've been able to do more deployments for the same amount of money than we would have done previously. That's allowed us to do some of the things across the network as we continue to transform the network not just in deploying 5G, but also the Intelligent Edge Network transformation going on, the One Fiber that's the backbone in there as well. That's going to give us benefits for years to come as a result of some of the efficiencies. And then, on the P&L side, some of those have helped contribute to the bottom line, but some of them have also allowed us to reinvest in the business, so that we can continue to be competitive in the marketplace, continue to bring new promotions and so on to our consumers and you see the value of us doing that. And in terms of the pace going forward, just because we've hit the target doesn't mean we slow down. We will have continuous improvement going forward here. The team has got good momentum. And the great news is, we didn't coast to the finish line here, we ran through the finish line, we accelerated through the tape. There is a lot more opportunities for us. Obviously, the last year has identified even more items for us. So, as we go forward, we will continue to increase the efficiency of the business both on the income statement and also from a capital side as well. So, a lot more to come.\nHans Vestberg: No. And I just want to agree with Matt. I think the structural changes on the platform thinking and using \u2013 making the network with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, some of those benefits we haven't even seen yet even with those investments are done. But also, the new structure we have in the group, we have the three strong CEOs running their businesses, has also unveiled much more efficiencies than we have seen before and how they run it. So, I agree with Matt. This is part of our governance constantly to see that we find more efficiencies because that means that we can be even stronger in the market and having the best cost structure for us is important.\nMichael Rollins: And is this a target you would expect to continue to give further updates on and compare it relative to what the initial $10 billion goal was? Or now that you've achieved the goal, does the progress just get wrapped into the totality of financial performance and outlooks for Verizon?\nMatthew Ellis: As we go forward here, obviously, over the past three, four years, as we looked at the opportunities ahead of us, this was a major opportunity. So that's how we gave a very specific target. As I mentioned, we will continue to work with this. It will be obviously inherent in our targets. But as I think about the biggest opportunities ahead of us over the next three to four years, they are around growth. Everything we're doing with 5G and all the other parts of our business. So, that's why the targets that we gave at the Investor Day were all about growth, whether that be how quickly we're going to deploy the C-Band that we got, continuing to build out mmWave, the total addressable market for 5G Home, for MEC, and then the revenue growth that we talked about over the next five years. We will obviously continue to drive cost savings and efficiencies throughout the business. But the biggest opportunities for us going forward here when we look at everything in front of us is driving top line growth and we're very excited about pursuing those.\nOperator: The next question is from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Comcast significantly changed its pricing in the MVNO to now offer sort of family plan discounts. Can you just talk about the renegotiation that you and the cable industry just had on the MVNO and what your view is of the kind of the status of that relationship and how you see it evolving going forward? Obviously, the new pricing is considerably more aggressive and now sits on top of your pricing all the way down in family plans up to about four or five lines.\nHans Vestberg: I cannot go into details of any commercial agreements we have. But what I can say is that, we feel good about our network-as-a-service strategy where we have our value \u2013 our own sort of premium brand with Verizon. We have the MVNOs addressing a certain part and then we have the Visible and all of that. That's the whole idea. And for us this is accretive. We have a good relationship with our MVNO partners. We see them as enterprise customers, but we also see that this is accretive to us because we have all these. Nobody in the market has the same opportunity as we have to play all the way from our premium Verizon, which you heard Matt and me talk about, how we migrate and we're doing it in a great job, Ronan and team. And then we also have the MVNO partners bringing in customers and revenue and the best return on investment. And ultimately, we start building new markets with Visible and later on this year with TracFone and then we have an unparalleled position to anyone else in the market to be growing.  So, I feel good about it. I feel good about the relationship with the MVNOs. We treat them as an important enterprise customers and we will continue to do so.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. I would agree with everything that Hans said. Look, the idea of bundled pricing for customers, when we introduced Share Everything Plans back in 2012, so it's something we've been doing for a long time. It makes a lot of sense. As Hans said, we're glad to have the traffic on our network and it just gives us another opportunity to monetize the network in multiple different ways.\nCraig Moffett: And if I could just ask one follow-up. Do you have any update on the timing of the TracFone transaction and the progress through regulatory in Washington?\nHans Vestberg: I think everything we said from the beginning is holding true. The process is continuing as expected. And as I said, this is a second half of 2021 event when this is going to be approved. So, it's progressing as expected. We don't believe it's going to be earlier. We think it's going to be somewhere in the third quarter, which we said also when we announced it. So, we will give an update when we know more about it. Just a couple of different events still there. But again, it's progressing as we expected from the beginning.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.\nTimothy Horan: Two questions. One, AT&T obviously has phone subsidies for all. Do you think this becomes a permanent fixture in the industry again? And then, secondly, business, I think, communications networking probably transformed more in the last year than the last decade with a lot more collaboration and conferencing. And, obviously, you acquired BlueJeans a year ago. Can you talk about how well integrated that is for the rest of your communication strategy and go-to-market strategy? And maybe, are you creating more UCaaS products or other bundles of SD-WAN services to go after the business market? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: On the first comment, you have seen our strategy, how we address the market. I cannot comment on what our competition is doing. We feel good about our positioning with the promos we're coming out right now and it actually resonates with our customers, the migration path we have and all of that. So, I don't think that you're going to see from us anything like that. So, on the BlueJeans and collaboration tools, we are integrating that every day here in new settings, with new partners all the time, because this is a great asset and we are scaling it right now as we acquired it. So, that feels really good and we still have the whole 5G era and the mobile edge compute area which is going to need video conferencing, et cetera, or communication services. So, there is a lot more to be done there. And we build that into the SD-WAN solutions where Tami and her team are continuously working with our customers that want to migrate right now and we have a great offerings in the market. So, we feel good about that, to be part of that transformation in the market, which is offsetting some of the wireline secular declines that we see as well. So, overall, I feel that we have a good position and a good work. Matt, anything more on that?\nMatthew Ellis: No. I think, look, the team has done a great job over the past 12 months. Remember, we closed this transaction during the pandemic. So, the ability to integrate and so on, we've done it all virtually and remotely. And so, a lot of good work going on. And as you mentioned, Tim, we see an opportunity for us to broaden the offerings that we have with our enterprise customers and seeing good traction there. So, I think they've done everything we expected to do at this point.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.\nFrank Louthan: Can you walk us through plans for the balance sheet? And then, in particular, would you consider monetizing any assets like Verizon Media and so forth to delever? And how we should think about the timing for delevering, if that's changed at all since the Analyst Day? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Our capital allocation priorities are the same as we said before. Number one, we invest in our business and I think we've been very clear what we're investing right now and the CapEx and the incremental CapEx for the C-Band.  Then, secondly, we have clearly outlined we're going to put our Board in the position to continue to grow the dividend. Matt and I feel really confident about that.  And then, thirdly is to do as we did after the Vodafone acquisition, to come down again to pre-Vodafone, we call that pre-COVID or pre-C-Band right now, because we want the change here, or a little bit fashionist, so we're doing that. And we see a great moment for that and we have basically a plan for that, given how we're going to generate growth and cash flow over the years. And as Matt outlined when we spoke about this last time, four to five years is what we believe is going to take us to get there. So, that's what we have in play right now and no other things are included or no other new updates neither.  So, we are just happy with the first quarter where we generated very good cash, which means that the first quarter is in there for us to start doing our work to get back to the pre-C-Band sort of financial metrics.\nMatthew Ellis: Hans, building on that, the leverage is \u2013 no change since the Investor Day. Good first quarter results. As you think about the revenue targets we've given for the five years, certainly on track there. The only other balance sheet update I'll give you is just on the cash balance. We've obviously had that elevated level since the start of the pandemic. Given the progress we've seen since the start of the first quarter in terms of the vaccination rates in this country and then also the stimulus getting past, we didn't know if that was going to happen or not. And now having the auction behind us, we do think that there is the opportunity for us to start moving cash to what was closer to something of pre-pandemic level. So, now that we've got all those things done. And as we get into the second quarter here, we'll start work on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. \nColby Synesael: Maybe just a follow-up on that. Free cash flow was pretty strong in the quarter, $5.2 billion. It seems like there were some benefit on the working capital side. Just curious if you talk about how you see that progressing through the remainder of the year and might be implied in terms of free cash flow for the year based on your target of 2.8 turns of leverage by year-end 2021. And then, secondly, I'm not sure if you'll able to give it, but I'm curious if you can give us any color in terms of subscriber numbers for the fixed wireless product at this point. And also just from a housekeeping perspective, what line item are you actually including subs, if it's anywhere at all? And then also, where is the revenue for that being shown? Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Absolutely happy with the free cash flow performance in the first quarter. Obviously, working capital was part of the benefit in there. And as we look at that, there is a couple of things going in different directions. As we saw the increase in equipment volumes, we saw the device payables, the receivables related to that increase. As you would expect, that was a benefit on cash flow last year. We said that would be a headwind this year \u2013 hope to be a headwind this year. Absolutely saw that. Offsetting that a little bit was the volumes that we saw in March helped inventory levels, but also we saw really good customer payments in the month of March too as those stimulus payments hit. So, as I think about cash flow for the rest of the year, I would expect the device receivables to continue to be a little bit of a headwind as those return to a more normal level after the lower volumes last year. And then, obviously, we don't have cash tax payments in the first quarter. Those come through the final three quarters of the year. And as we mentioned, we had a couple of favorable items in there last year. So, still feel good obviously about where cash flow is going to play out. So, no update on our year-end leverage target at this point, but really nice to have a strong first quarter in the bank. In terms of the fixed wireless access subscribers, as those expand, we'll start to disclose them. In terms of where the revenue shows up, you're seeing that show up in service revenue as Fios broadband does today. So, that's where the revenue will show up in the income statement.\nColby Synesael: So it's actually in the Fios segment opposed to in the\u2026\nMatthew Ellis: No, no, no. Not the same. Fios revenue show up in service revenue. So, on the same fixed wireless access will also show up as service revenue. And then\u2026\nColby Synesael: On the wireless side?\nMatthew Ellis: It will be on the wireless service revenue, correct.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar: I guess on the margin front, when you look at the Consumer segment, you have a tailwind from Fios margins as that revenue stabilizes or potentially starts flatlining due to broadband or the mix shifts away from video. And then as volumes pick up and you focus a bit more on volumes over the course of this year, there is a tailwind \u2013 I'm sorry, there is a headwind from that. So if you could just talk about the puts and takes when it comes to margins over the course of the year in the Consumer business, that would be useful? And then, secondly, when you think about the stimulus that was passed in December, it looks like some of that money can flow to wireless consumer, the subsidy. The $3 billion subsidy for broadband, I guess, some of that could flow to wireless consumers as well. Are you guys starting to see some of that impact, how big of a tailwind do you expect that to be in the second quarter? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: On the Consumer margins, I think we've historically produced very good margins across the business there and I'd expect that to continue going forward. As you identified, there is always a number of puts and takes out there as we move forward, and certainly, Fios is performing very well and is contributing nicely to that. But as you also rightly pointed out, equipment volumes were up significantly year-over-year. And obviously, that increases the denominator in the margin calculation without really increasing the numerator. So, you've got a number of different puts and takes. You'll have the ongoing impacts of building out the network in there as well. But we feel very good about the margins that we'll have for the rest of the year within Consumer, very much in line with what you would expect. And then, certainly, the seasonality showing up in the fourth quarter with the seasonal volumes that you would expect to see over the course of the holiday period. So, it's certainly to continue to be on track to give the \u2013 to meet the EPS guidance we have for the year, Consumer margins need to be a strong contributor to that and I expect they'll be. In terms of stimulus benefits, as I think I mentioned in the comment about working capital, we're seeing very good payment patterns from consumers at this point. And that's where I think we'll see the vast majority of any benefit show up. So, those payments were very strong in the first quarter, and I suspect the stimulus bills had something to do with that. But it means that our consumers are in very good shape as compared to where they otherwise might have been given the impacts of the pandemic going into the second quarter and we feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year ahead of us.\nBrady Connor: Everybody, we're done for today. Thank you very much for the participation and we'll see you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. As Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, the first quarter has been a truly exciting and transformative period for our company.  I am pleased to report that we're off to an excellent start for the year based on our strong operational and financial performance. We are seeing continued strength in our core business with traction across all five of our growth vectors, driving higher revenues and increased demand for our products and services.  With the positive momentum exiting the first quarter and the ongoing recovery of business activity, we are highly confident that our actions in the marketplace will deliver strong results throughout the year.  In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $32.9 billion, up year-over-year by 4.0%. High quality sustainable wireless service revenue growth, a recovery in wireless equipment revenues, strong Fios momentum, and excellent digital advertising trends resulted in revenue growth across consumer, business and media.  Total wireless service revenues were up 2.4% year-over-year, an acceleration from the 2.2% year-over-year growth that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Additional details on total wireless performance are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website.  Total Fios revenues were up 2.5% year-over-year, driven by the strong broadband volumes in recent quarters. Our portfolio of mobility and broadband products and services continues to lead the industry, delivering value to our customers. And we are well positioned to maintain and expand our leadership position as we enter new markets and broaden our offerings and network capabilities.  I'm extremely proud of the team's execution of our Business Excellence Program over the past three years. At the end of the first quarter, we achieved our cumulative cash savings goal of $10 billion, well ahead of our year-end 2021 target. We will realize additional benefits moving forward from the ways we've improved our operating systems and procedures. As we've said previously, we will create additional savings opportunities on a continuous basis beyond this program.  The strong revenue performance across our three business segments for the quarter, combined with our best-in-class cost structure and disciplined focus on the business, delivered adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion, which represents growth of 2.0% over the prior year. The Jetpack recall had a 50 basis points impact to adjusted EBITDA margin during the quarter.  Brady highlighted the adjusted EPS for the first quarter at $1.31. The growth of 4.0% reflects the strength in our core business and sets the stage for Verizon to fully capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace, while giving us excellent momentum relative to our full-year year adjusted EPS guidance.  Now, let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. This quarter, we continued to see excitement around our unlimited offerings, 5G capabilities, Mix & Match value proposition and our best-in-class Fios broadband services. All of this is part of our customer differentiation strategy, which drives deeper and broader relationships with our customers.  Starting with wireless, we had total postpaid activations of 6.4 million for the quarter, up approximately 14% compared to the same period last year, made up of approximately 2.3 million gross adds and 4.1 million upgrades.  First quarter seasonality drove phone net losses of 225,000, which included the last major cohort of disconnects of approximately 90,000 phones related to our Keep America Connected program. Early in the quarter, wireless in-store sales were again tempered by our COVID safety protocols as we saw elevated levels of store closures and limited foot traffic. Beginning in March, the improved COVID environment allowed for almost all of our stores to be open. Not surprisingly, we saw our best volume of the quarter in March, producing positive phone net adds in a month. The strong March momentum combined with our new innovative promotional offers positions us well for the second quarter.  We continue to be pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting. Similar to last quarter, over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan and over 50% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter-end, over 65% of our base was on an unlimited plan, with more than 23% of our base taking a premium plan. We have plenty of room to continue to expand these penetration rates and believe that they will grow alongside our 5G adoption rates, which currently resides at 14% of our consumer postpaid phone base.  5G adoption and the customer differentiation associated with our premium and unlimited plans will further benefit our retention efforts, which remains strong in Q1 with phone churn of 0.77% for the quarter. We continue to take a balanced and cost effective approach to customer retention with strong NPS scores, best-in-class network performance and strong value proposition, leading to our excellent levels of customer retention.  Turn into Fios, we posted our third consecutive quarter of strong growth and high take rates for our best-in-class broadband products, with consumer Fios internet net adds of 98,000, well ahead of the first quarter 2020 performance of 59,000.  Total Fios Internet net adds of 102,000 was the best first quarter performance in six years. This reflects both the quality of the product as well as the positive sentiment around our Mix & Match phone pricing structure, which provides our customers with unmatched simplicity and optionality.  Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the consumer financial performance. The higher phone activations in the quarter were the major driver of the 4.7% increase in operating revenues to $22.8 billion.  The continued adoption of our unlimited and premium unlimited plans drove over 1.5% increase in consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter of $13.7 billion. This growth comes even as Travel Pass and our international roaming revenues remain at subdued levels. Strong Internet volumes drove the 2.2% increase in consumer Fios revenue to $2.9 billion.  While we continue to experience revenue pressure associated with secular video trends, our broadband subscriber growth combined with a shift up in speed tiers more than offset that pressure and will continue to drive solid revenue performance for us.  Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.8% to $10.4 billion. The EBITDA margin was 45.5% in the quarter, down 90 basis points from the prior year due to higher volumes, which drove increased equipment revenues and associated costs, as well as the Jetpack recall, which had approximately 30 basis points of impact on EBITDA margin for the quarter.  Now, let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Our Business team continues to lead the industry towards next generation B2B applications. Hans referenced some of their accomplishments from the prior 90 days, including announcements on MEC and private 5G.  In addition, we launched Verizon Frontline, our branding for our advanced network and technology we deliver for first responders. Being the wireless market share leader for public safety and in all of our other customer groups puts us in an ideal position with our customers to be their digital transformation partner of choice.  Business wireless trends continued their strong momentum in the first quarter of 2021. Postpaid activations were 2 million, with total net adds of 156,000, including 47,000 phones. Remember that Q1 of last year benefited from the COVID related bulk purchases, providing much of the variance for the year-over-year change in gross to net adds.  Public sector demand remains strong, even as distance learning programs settle into a more normal pattern of buying activity. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, as the team continues to make progress in supporting local businesses as they position for an improving environment. As more stores reopened in early March, not only did consumer volumes see a lift, SMB volumes benefited as well, an encouraging sign for the rebound.  Our enterprise team continues to assist our customers in their digital transformation and unlock the potential of 5G. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, an improvement of 1 basis point over the prior year. Our strong churn performance reflects the strength and reliability of our network, combined with the full suite of services and solutions that we provide.  Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the business financial performance. The high demand for our services and our brand reputation for reliable connectivity has translated into healthy revenue growth with Verizon Business group.  Operating revenues for the Business segment was $7.8 billion, up 1.3% year-over-year, the highest rates of growth since the creation of the Business segment in the Verizon 2.0 structure. This growth highlights the success of our business transformation process as strong wireless service growth of 6.2% offset secular pressure in wireline.  Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, down approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. The Jetpack recall mentioned earlier had a more pronounced impact on the Business segment, reducing EBITDA margins by about 130 basis points.  Now, let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continues to deliver strong performance driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms.  Total revenue for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up approximately 10.4% from a year ago, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends, growing 26%, including 45% growth in DSP revenues. Revenue from our owned and operated brands grew 13% compared to the same period last year.  We saw continued high consumer engagement with strength in sports and finance, as daily active users grew 22% and 8% respectively from the prior year.  Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.7 billion, up approximately $0.9 billion from the prior year, driven by our continued operational discipline and net benefits from our liability management activities, which lowered borrowing rates from last year.  Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $4.5 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. This includes approximately $40 million for C-Band related items.  As a result, free cash flow for the quarter was $5.2 billion, up 46% year-over-year. We made payments of $45 billion in the first quarter to the FCC for C-Band spectrum won at the recently completed Auction 107.  To finance this purchase, we raised over $31 billion in March, in addition to the $12 billion raised in Q4. The weighted average maturity of these C-Band borrowings was 17 years, and we achieved a very attractive average cost of funding of 2.5%, benefiting from record order books for our US dollar offerings.  We are delighted that the credit rating agencies considered the spectrum asset purchases as strategic and critical to our business operations and held their rating levels unchanged. The success in the capital markets is a result of our disciplined capital allocation policy, coupled with our consistent track record of delivering on our commitments made to our investors.  We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $137.4 billion and our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9 times. Based on our current cash flow assumptions, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 2.8 times by the end of the year. We will evaluate the level of our cash balance based on the recovery in the economy and developments with the pandemic.  Now, let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. As Hans mentioned in his opening remarks, we're on track to achieve our guidance for the year, which remains unchanged. Reaffirming our comments from the Investor Day last month, we expect no material impact to our adjusted earnings per share guidance from our C-Band program for this year. We do expect C-Band related capital spending to be between $2 billion to $3 billion for 2021, and we will provide updates on the quarterly earnings calls.  With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2021. No, I think you touched on the key points, Hans. The only other thing I'd add is you mentioned the strong momentum coming out of margin to the quarter. You add that with the promotion that we put in place at the start of the month that we think is an innovative promotion that's addressing a customer pain point that nobody else has addressed in the past. We're seeing good traction on that in the early days of that. So, certainly feel good about the momentum heading into the quarter on the volume side. When you add that in with the financial performance we saw in the first quarter, it was set up nicely for 2Q and the rest of the year. Still just to follow-on on that, it is part of, as Hans mentioned previously, about building the network once and then monetizing it different ways. Just as we talk about with wireless and 5G, monetizing it in different ways, with the fiber, we have the same opportunity too. So, once you \u2013 as you're lighting up those cell sites, when you go past an enterprise building, the opportunity to go in there and have more customers or enterprise customers on net rather than paying a third-party access absolutely is an opportunity for us to create incremental return on that investment in fiber. So, again, another example of multi-use network. If I start with the Fios revenue, what you're really seeing here is the impact of what the team started in the first quarter last year. We introduced Mix & Match into our Fios offering. It's been great for our consumer business. We introduced it into Fios in first quarter last year. Obviously, the initial benefit we were seeing there got interrupted as the pandemic got underway. But we now have three quarters of very strong volumes, starting in third quarter last year, fourth quarter and now again in the first quarter here, our best first quarter in total Fios' six years.  And so, what that means is you've got an Internet base of customers in Fios that's now more than 5% higher than it was a year ago. And so, that's driving the revenue growth even as you have the secular pressures coming on the video side. It's really volume created as much as step-ups or anything else, although there are obviously step-ups in there and opportunities to move customers to gigabit service and so on. But the strong volumes based off the quality of service, combined with bringing the Mix & Match there, has worked very well for us in consumer mobility, now working well for us in Fios. And as you saw, we brought the Mix & Match construct into our SMB wireless offerings as well. So, very excited about what that's going to do.  On the Media revenue side, as you say, the 10.4%, up double digits for the second consecutive quarter, you remember both fourth quarter and now first quarter aren't really lapping COVID impacted quarters. So, what you're seeing here is the benefit of the hard work the team's been doing over the past couple of years. And that's really showing up on the advertising trends, as we talked about there. Offsetting that, to your question, how do you get from those higher numbers down to the 10%, things like search revenue continue to be a headwind and will likely continue to be so. But we're very encouraged by the advertising and the O&O momentum that we have. And as you say now, that's not a one year thing as we go forward. The team's gaining some good momentum. Hans? Look, I'm incredibly proud of the team's efforts over the past three plus years now as we've really lent in on identifying ways to continue to make us more efficient and maintain our position having the best cost structure in the industry, which we think is going to continue to be important going forward, obviously. In terms of your first question, there is a split between both CapEx and P&L items behind the $10 billion. It's roughly even between those two, where you see that come from. So on the CapEx side, that means we've been able to do more deployments for the same amount of money than we would have done previously. That's allowed us to do some of the things across the network as we continue to transform the network not just in deploying 5G, but also the Intelligent Edge Network transformation going on, the One Fiber that's the backbone in there as well. That's going to give us benefits for years to come as a result of some of the efficiencies. And then, on the P&L side, some of those have helped contribute to the bottom line, but some of them have also allowed us to reinvest in the business, so that we can continue to be competitive in the marketplace, continue to bring new promotions and so on to our consumers and you see the value of us doing that. And in terms of the pace going forward, just because we've hit the target doesn't mean we slow down. We will have continuous improvement going forward here. The team has got good momentum. And the great news is, we didn't coast to the finish line here, we ran through the finish line, we accelerated through the tape. There is a lot more opportunities for us. Obviously, the last year has identified even more items for us. So, as we go forward, we will continue to increase the efficiency of the business both on the income statement and also from a capital side as well. So, a lot more to come. As we go forward here, obviously, over the past three, four years, as we looked at the opportunities ahead of us, this was a major opportunity. So that's how we gave a very specific target. As I mentioned, we will continue to work with this. It will be obviously inherent in our targets. But as I think about the biggest opportunities ahead of us over the next three to four years, they are around growth. Everything we're doing with 5G and all the other parts of our business. So, that's why the targets that we gave at the Investor Day were all about growth, whether that be how quickly we're going to deploy the C-Band that we got, continuing to build out mmWave, the total addressable market for 5G Home, for MEC, and then the revenue growth that we talked about over the next five years. We will obviously continue to drive cost savings and efficiencies throughout the business. But the biggest opportunities for us going forward here when we look at everything in front of us is driving top line growth and we're very excited about pursuing those. Yeah. I would agree with everything that Hans said. Look, the idea of bundled pricing for customers, when we introduced Share Everything Plans back in 2012, so it's something we've been doing for a long time. It makes a lot of sense. As Hans said, we're glad to have the traffic on our network and it just gives us another opportunity to monetize the network in multiple different ways. No. I think, look, the team has done a great job over the past 12 months. Remember, we closed this transaction during the pandemic. So, the ability to integrate and so on, we've done it all virtually and remotely. And so, a lot of good work going on. And as you mentioned, Tim, we see an opportunity for us to broaden the offerings that we have with our enterprise customers and seeing good traction there. So, I think they've done everything we expected to do at this point. Hans, building on that, the leverage is \u2013 no change since the Investor Day. Good first quarter results. As you think about the revenue targets we've given for the five years, certainly on track there. The only other balance sheet update I'll give you is just on the cash balance. We've obviously had that elevated level since the start of the pandemic. Given the progress we've seen since the start of the first quarter in terms of the vaccination rates in this country and then also the stimulus getting past, we didn't know if that was going to happen or not. And now having the auction behind us, we do think that there is the opportunity for us to start moving cash to what was closer to something of pre-pandemic level. So, now that we've got all those things done. And as we get into the second quarter here, we'll start work on that. Absolutely happy with the free cash flow performance in the first quarter. Obviously, working capital was part of the benefit in there. And as we look at that, there is a couple of things going in different directions. As we saw the increase in equipment volumes, we saw the device payables, the receivables related to that increase. As you would expect, that was a benefit on cash flow last year. We said that would be a headwind this year \u2013 hope to be a headwind this year. Absolutely saw that. Offsetting that a little bit was the volumes that we saw in March helped inventory levels, but also we saw really good customer payments in the month of March too as those stimulus payments hit. So, as I think about cash flow for the rest of the year, I would expect the device receivables to continue to be a little bit of a headwind as those return to a more normal level after the lower volumes last year. And then, obviously, we don't have cash tax payments in the first quarter. Those come through the final three quarters of the year. And as we mentioned, we had a couple of favorable items in there last year. So, still feel good obviously about where cash flow is going to play out. So, no update on our year-end leverage target at this point, but really nice to have a strong first quarter in the bank. In terms of the fixed wireless access subscribers, as those expand, we'll start to disclose them. In terms of where the revenue shows up, you're seeing that show up in service revenue as Fios broadband does today. So, that's where the revenue will show up in the income statement. No, no, no. Not the same. Fios revenue show up in service revenue. So, on the same fixed wireless access will also show up as service revenue. And then... It will be on the wireless service revenue, correct. On the Consumer margins, I think we've historically produced very good margins across the business there and I'd expect that to continue going forward. As you identified, there is always a number of puts and takes out there as we move forward, and certainly, Fios is performing very well and is contributing nicely to that. But as you also rightly pointed out, equipment volumes were up significantly year-over-year. And obviously, that increases the denominator in the margin calculation without really increasing the numerator. So, you've got a number of different puts and takes. You'll have the ongoing impacts of building out the network in there as well. But we feel very good about the margins that we'll have for the rest of the year within Consumer, very much in line with what you would expect. And then, certainly, the seasonality showing up in the fourth quarter with the seasonal volumes that you would expect to see over the course of the holiday period. So, it's certainly to continue to be on track to give the \u2013 to meet the EPS guidance we have for the year, Consumer margins need to be a strong contributor to that and I expect they'll be. In terms of stimulus benefits, as I think I mentioned in the comment about working capital, we're seeing very good payment patterns from consumers at this point. And that's where I think we'll see the vast majority of any benefit show up. So, those payments were very strong in the first quarter, and I suspect the stimulus bills had something to do with that. But it means that our consumers are in very good shape as compared to where they otherwise might have been given the impacts of the pandemic going into the second quarter and we feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year ahead of us."

            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thanks, Brady, and welcome to all to this first quarter earnings call. We marked more than one year since the devastating effects of COVID-19. While we see significant progress in vaccination, customer sentiment and recover our economy, there is still a lot to go before we're back to normal.  I'm proud how Verizon has responded during this period for all our stakeholders as we have executed on our balanced stakeholder-driven strategy. And as I said, during the worst period of the pandemic, Verizon will come out stronger as a company when this is over.  During the last 12 months, we have progressed all our positions with customers, employees, and added great assets to an already strong position. And today, we stand stronger than ever to compete in a market and serve our customers.  Looking back on the quarter, we amplified and accelerated our strategy through our average 160 megahertz nationwide position in C-Band. And as we laid out in our Investor Day, the combination of C-Band and our millimeter wave places us in a unique position of strength to execute on all 5G opportunities, 5G Home, 5G mobility and 5G mobile edge compute. On top of that, we have all our five vectors of growth in place, together with our network leadership and a strong network as a service foundation.  And the progress we made in the quarter confirms that our strategy is working. We had growth in all our businesses for the first time since the launch of Verizon 2.0. We had growth in both EPS and cashflow.  With all this work by our great team, we have a head start in the post-COVID era, with a clear and differentiated strategy, diverse go-to-market models, network leadership, industry-leading partner ecosystem and a strong brand, all of which together provides a great platform and foundation to achieve our growth targets for 2021 and beyond. Let me talk about some of the highlights from the first quarter. Our network team continues to do great things by leading the network performance in the market, as well as deploying more assets than ever before \u2013 millimeter wave, C-Band, 4G, 5G and fiber. I have a lot of confidence that this team will accelerate our network leadership.  Our unique Mix & Match model continues to deliver with the migration to unlimited and unlimited premium in the quarter, as well as building on our exclusive offerings like Disney+ and the most recent Discovery+ that was launched earlier in the quarter. And we're pleased with the Discovery+ with the current enrollment rates we've seen so far.  Our brand and responsible business framework, Citizen Verizon, continue to set standards in the industry. Verizon was recognized by Fast Company as the sixth most innovative company in the Corporate Social Responsibility earlier this quarter. Brand Finance recognized us as the most valuable telecom brand. Within ESG, we have ambitious goals, such as our commitment to be net zero in the carbon emission by 2035. Our longstanding focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is evidenced by the fact that we have 100% pay equity by gender globally and by race ethnicity in the United States. And earlier this week, we also launched our 2020 ESG report. We continue with a high level of deployment on millimeter wave and fiber in the quarter and we're on the track to deliver on our operational targets for the year.  We brought 5G service to several additional cities. We currently have 30 5G home and 67 5G mobility cities live and more to come. We recently signed our first European private 5G deal with Associated British Ports. We also expanded our 5G edge partnership with AWS, with private 5G and edge computing to our customers.  We continue to scale our network as a service strategy across new markets and verticals through a diverse set of partnerships. We have partnered with leading brands across diverse verticals, such as Honda to innovate connected and autonomous driving; Deloitte and SAP to create a 5G and edge computing retail digital platform that will provide retailers with real-time operations data; and Dreamscape and Arizona State University to build and commercialize immersive learning and training.  At our Investor Day, we shared with you our plans and commitment for C-Band and Ultra Wideband deployment, which continues to progress well. Our intent is to invest $10 billion of incremental C-Band CapEx to accelerate the integration on this capacity into our network.  We recently signed deals with Crown Castle and SBA to accelerate our C-Band deployment and look forward to providing further updates on the build status throughout the year.  We have already ordered half of the total network equipment needed from our 5G suppliers to support C-Band deployments in 2021. And the satellite operators are on track to clear the spectrum between third and fourth quarter of 2021 for the first tranche of spectrum.  In addition, we continue to expand our Ultra Wideband coverage in Q1. We deployed 3,600 new Ultra Wideband sites. And to date, we have close to 21,000 sites on air and on track to reach 30,000 by the end of this year.  One Fiber formed the strategic backbone of our intelligent edge network, and we continue to expand fiber deployment. And to date, we have deployed more than 42,000 route miles.  We were also pleased with the low rates we achieved for long-term financing of this critical strategic investment. We view the record investor demand as supportive of our strategy and our financial discipline.  Lastly, we were also very proud to offer prominent roles to nine diversity and inclusion financial firms as part of the $25 billion financing.  As I outlined earlier, our investments in our network and customers are generating solid revenue growth across all three of our operating groups. Our success in Mix & Match continue to drive uptake of unlimited plans and higher ARPA, supporting year-over-year growth of 2.4% in wireless service revenue, up from 2.2% in the fourth quarter last year. Ronan and the team closed out Q1 with strong momentum. And I'm excited to see their Q2 performance now that almost all our stores have reopened. In addition, we see solid growth in Fios and with Fios Internet reporting the best first quarter net adds in six years.  Additionally, Verizon Media Group continued to contribute meaningful growth, including the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year on the top line.  With that, let me ask Matt to provide some deeper insight to the financial of the first quarter. Thank you, Matt. Let me sum this up in a couple of easy buckets. First of all, our strategy is unchanged. Our focus is clear. We're going to accelerate our multi-purpose network strategy, including the C-Band that were required. We're going to focus on amplify and accelerate the five vectors of growth. And we're going to see with that that we're going to deliver on our 2021 commitments both operationally and financially.  And as I said earlier, I feel really good about our position and the team that I have that they will deliver on that.  With that, I hand it over to Brady. Thank you, John. On the competitive situation, I mean, as you have seen yourself, it is a competitive market and it's been for quite a while. But with our model, I can see that we are actually winning in any case because with our growth trajectory that we have in all our businesses and a unique model, especially on the consumer side with the Mix & Match, the value proposition, and you saw in the quarter, we continue to do that. And \u2013 but also, as Matt mentioned, it was a little bit light in the beginning of the quarter because of stores that were closed, et cetera. And then we saw a very good sort of strength in our port ratios and our growth in the end of the quarter because we have all the stores open. So, we look forward to the second quarter and the second part of the year. And as Ronan said when we had the Investor Day, we believe we're going to have a good second part of the year. Second quarter is really close to us. And what we've seen so far, we feel good about it. So, again, we have an overall strategy in order to address the market for consumer that is really working with this step up, the migrations and all of that. So, in general, we feel good about it. The team is doing well. You saw we came out with a new promo as well. And we've always had lots of financial discipline. We do this because we know we can actually capture market at the good high-quality customers.  On the infrastructure, as I said, this is in the planning stages. So, it's hard to say if this is true or not. So - but on the other hand, I think that what we are telling the administration is, of course, that accessibility, affordability and usability are the three buckets to address the digital divide.  And when it comes to accessibility, we have to recognize \u2013 and I worked in 180 countries with networks, that the networks during the COVID-19 in the U.S., they were really working well. There were basically no major issues at all. They could deliver even though traffic moved around. So, I think that what we are advocating for, we want that private sector continue to invest in the network and leading that charge and then having government work more with the affordability of it. So, we have plans that meets all needs for all different customer segments in the market. So, that's what we're advocating for. That's the same as BRT is advocating for as well. We don't think that any price regulation would be \u2013 that will be counterproductive to the market. So, in general, again, it's very early on. I mean, it's a plan that has not been approved and submitted, but at least we're advocating together with BRT and with ourselves what we think should be the right.  Matt, any more comments on the competitive landscape? Thank you, Simon. Yes, we had good Fios quarter again. I mean, overall, I think the broadband is in demand and our high-quality Fios, of course, a great opportunity for us to expand on them. We \u2013 I think personally, that this will continue. The demand for broadband will continue. We are just starting a total revolution of using technology, which is scalable and sustainable in the post era of the COVID. So - and we are great position. And that also is going to help me tremendously when we come with 5G Home or millimeter wave and C-Band and all that because we know how to deal with home broadband. And that is an advantage we have to any others that is trying to do fixed wireless access and we've been on to it for a long time.  And as we saw as well, now we're up to over 30 markets with 5G Home, I mean, adding some 20 very recently. So, we're on fire on this right now. We have a very big belief in our 5G Home. And then, later the year, when C-Band comes, we're going to add even more coverage on that. And all is embedded in our work with the ecosystem from the from the beginning and how we have developed our own IPRs on how to do self-install, how to do all the sort of grids when it comes to millimeter wave and having a great opportunity to see that our customer gets a fantastic service.  So, all in all, this is a full package that we are bringing to the market in order to have a full scale broadband for the country. I think it's absolutely the right moment. But don't forget, on the business side as well, we now - it's called 5G Internet on the business side. We are using the same methodology. We are doing the scaling on the same platforms and we address another market with it. It goes back to a strategy that we had for all the time. We have a network service and we scale it with different customers. And that scale will help us with growth. But it also means that with the platform thinking we have, that will fall to the bottom line. And if you see in this quarter, all three units are growing and we're bringing it to all to bottom line and we still have more to do. And - but we know how to do it and we'll have the model. First of all, I can only say that we are on to a false start on the C-Band. It's only some six weeks ago since we can start to talk to our employees, we could talk to the partners, we can talk to the satellite companies, our suppliers [indiscernible]. We have already ordered half of the equipment. We have made agreement with the tower cos. We have talked to the satellite companies that has reaffirmed that they believe that they can clear this first tranche of the spectrum in third quarter and fourth quarter. And we actually made a press release yesterday that we're now starting deploying C-Band as well, and that's six weeks. So, the technology was on fire to make this happen.  And as said when we had our investor day, we said that we worked with the date we got from the FCC because we hadn't talked to anybody. Right now, this is the best dates we have. And of course, we are pushing as much as possible to see that we get this up for our customers as soon as possible in order to get a great experience.  And then flowing that over to the to the phone question. I think that we have seen a great uptake on 5G phones and unlimited premium. And as Matt said, in the quarter, over 20% of the unlimited new customers took unlimited premium. That tells you there's a lot of value in it and a lot of 5G in it. And with the new promo that Matt talked about, we believe that is going to also drive 5G. So, we believe that what we have in the market right now will continue to grow the 5G base. And as said, this is going faster than what we saw in 4G. So, we will continue to monitor, of course. But we see a good uptake on it.  And we can also add that, when it comes to the iPad that have been just recently launched, it's also another addition of mmWave and how that comes into the whole ecosystem. So, again, we feel good about the uptake and we feel good about the line of products we have. And we have the promo supporting it. So, that's going to also make it go well together with the C-Band deployment coming later this year. Tami: I think on the enterprise side, of course, we have some opportunities with the fiber. But remember, our priorities was clear. It's getting fiber to our 4G and our 5G network. That's really where we can get the most bang for the buck. And then we do [indiscernible] enterprise when we have them.  On the small and medium, that's going to take some time. That's what I said before. But now, when we have the 5G Internet, we will actually have fixed wireless access, we have a really good product for small and medium businesses. So, some possibility on enterprise, but they are also still to come. As was said, it's more focused on building the network with fiber, right, so we can see that our customer gets the experience that they need to have when it comes to our exceptionally great 5G with mmWave and C-Band. I just want to reiterate on the Verizon Media Group again. If we go back to where we started the strategy in 2018, we reset the business plan and we start to cut costs, then we reshaped all the products all the way from the owned and operated. And all the OO brands, we combined the ad platform. The work has been immense by the Verizon Media Group team. And now we see sort of the fruits of that hard work with growth in two consecutive quarters with double digits. So, I just want to shout out to the team that this was the plan we set and they are actually delivering on the plan. So, I think we have a great future with these guys. They have clearly a good product portfolio. And digital is going to be important in the future. So by that, I think we're in a good position. No. And I just want to agree with Matt. I think the structural changes on the platform thinking and using \u2013 making the network with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, some of those benefits we haven't even seen yet even with those investments are done. But also, the new structure we have in the group, we have the three strong CEOs running their businesses, has also unveiled much more efficiencies than we have seen before and how they run it. So, I agree with Matt. This is part of our governance constantly to see that we find more efficiencies because that means that we can be even stronger in the market and having the best cost structure for us is important. I cannot go into details of any commercial agreements we have. But what I can say is that, we feel good about our network-as-a-service strategy where we have our value \u2013 our own sort of premium brand with Verizon. We have the MVNOs addressing a certain part and then we have the Visible and all of that. That's the whole idea. And for us this is accretive. We have a good relationship with our MVNO partners. We see them as enterprise customers, but we also see that this is accretive to us because we have all these. Nobody in the market has the same opportunity as we have to play all the way from our premium Verizon, which you heard Matt and me talk about, how we migrate and we're doing it in a great job, Ronan and team. And then we also have the MVNO partners bringing in customers and revenue and the best return on investment. And ultimately, we start building new markets with Visible and later on this year with TracFone and then we have an unparalleled position to anyone else in the market to be growing.  So, I feel good about it. I feel good about the relationship with the MVNOs. We treat them as an important enterprise customers and we will continue to do so. I think everything we said from the beginning is holding true. The process is continuing as expected. And as I said, this is a second half of 2021 event when this is going to be approved. So, it's progressing as expected. We don't believe it's going to be earlier. We think it's going to be somewhere in the third quarter, which we said also when we announced it. So, we will give an update when we know more about it. Just a couple of different events still there. But again, it's progressing as we expected from the beginning. On the first comment, you have seen our strategy, how we address the market. I cannot comment on what our competition is doing. We feel good about our positioning with the promos we're coming out right now and it actually resonates with our customers, the migration path we have and all of that. So, I don't think that you're going to see from us anything like that. So, on the BlueJeans and collaboration tools, we are integrating that every day here in new settings, with new partners all the time, because this is a great asset and we are scaling it right now as we acquired it. So, that feels really good and we still have the whole 5G era and the mobile edge compute area which is going to need video conferencing, et cetera, or communication services. So, there is a lot more to be done there. And we build that into the SD-WAN solutions where Tami and her team are continuously working with our customers that want to migrate right now and we have a great offerings in the market. So, we feel good about that, to be part of that transformation in the market, which is offsetting some of the wireline secular declines that we see as well. So, overall, I feel that we have a good position and a good work. Matt, anything more on that? Our capital allocation priorities are the same as we said before. Number one, we invest in our business and I think we've been very clear what we're investing right now and the CapEx and the incremental CapEx for the C-Band.  Then, secondly, we have clearly outlined we're going to put our Board in the position to continue to grow the dividend. Matt and I feel really confident about that.  And then, thirdly is to do as we did after the Vodafone acquisition, to come down again to pre-Vodafone, we call that pre-COVID or pre-C-Band right now, because we want the change here, or a little bit fashionist, so we're doing that. And we see a great moment for that and we have basically a plan for that, given how we're going to generate growth and cash flow over the years. And as Matt outlined when we spoke about this last time, four to five years is what we believe is going to take us to get there. So, that's what we have in play right now and no other things are included or no other new updates neither.  So, we are just happy with the first quarter where we generated very good cash, which means that the first quarter is in there for us to start doing our work to get back to the pre-C-Band sort of financial metrics."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website, a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results. I hope you all had a chance to read the material. I'm going to briefly discuss the financial highlights before turning the call over to Hans to lead a discussion on our strategy, guidance and forward-looking view of the business. Slide 3 shows a summary of our results. Consolidated total operating revenue was $35.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 3.5% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue grew 5.9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter benefiting from unlimited plan migrations, our best fourth quarter total postpaid net additions in seven years, pricing actions that we began implementing in June of 2022 and a full quarter contribution from TracFone. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $11.7 billion for the fourth quarter, down 0.2% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset by higher promotional expense, declines in our high-margin legacy wireline business and inflationary cost pressures. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $1.19, a decrease of 10.5% compared to the similar period in 2021, driven by higher interest expense, depreciation and lower pension-related income. Finally, we delivered $14.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2022 and exited the year with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone. On today's earnings call, I will focus on our strategy, guidance, expectation for the business and why I'm so excited about the opportunities for the year ahead.  Let me start by saying that we delivered against all of our revised financial targets provided in July, including 8.6% wireless service revenue growth, $47.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $5.18. I'm pleased that the momentum built during the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we set the expectation of a positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter, and we delivered against that expectation. Although we have more work to do, I'm encouraged by the improvement and expect to build on the momentum in 2023. The improvement in the consumer performance was complemented by yet another strong mobility quarter in Verizon Business Group as well as continued success in fixed wireless access with net adds up sequentially in both consumer and business. Together with FiOS result, we added 416,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, our best total broadband performance in over a decade and approximately 1.3 million total broadband net adds for the year. Regarding our guidance, we have positioned ourselves to improve on our performance in 2023 and expect to build a good underlying operational momentum, although that will be offset by the impact of the noncash factors, such as promo amortization in our revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, we're seeing some impact of high interest rates. At the same time, we expect our capital spending to reduce significantly in 2023 as we reach the end of our incremental C-band spending, which will be a tailwind for free cash flow. We're striving to make further improvement and take even more actions that will ultimately lead to better performance than the guidance we have outlined today. Matt will discuss the guidance in more detail later in the call. The industry enters 2023 with continued macroeconomic uncertainty as elevated inflation and interest rates impact the broader economy. Still, demand for our service remains strong, given the growing importance of mobility and broadband to both consumers and businesses. The combination of our network reliability, diverse portfolio of products and services and the industry's strongest customer base provides us the flexibility to meet the changing customer needs even in a difficult economic environment. We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders by our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Taking these three metrics together is how we hold ourselves accountable. We're well positioned to improve our performance and accelerate growth on a go-forward basis with network quality as the foundation for our strategy and growth. We expect the wireless mobility and nationwide broadband will be the most significant contributor to Verizon's growth for the next several years. In 2022, we made important progress in each of these businesses. Our growth in these areas will be driven by extending our network advantage using our C-band spectrum, which we expect will strengthen our network leadership in the coming years. We are taking a balanced approach on how we run our business, adding the right customers and generating ongoing profits from them is how we maximize value. We remain focused on our cost reduction and efficiency actions, while also maximizing our return on invested capital via better monetizing our assets to put us on track to improve free cash flow going forward. We're proud of being the strongest in the industry in terms of generating cash and want to preserve that while also continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We're executing with discipline and will continue driving a strategy which produces sustainable long-term growth and profitability.  As connectivity plays an increasingly important role for consumers and businesses, it is the quality of the connectivity that matters the most. Not all networks are architected and built the same, nor have the same quality. We have seen these differences in the past and expect that 5G will be no different. Our engineers have the best track record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity where needed and filling service gaps where they exist even as capital intensity declines in the coming years. In the shift to 5G, we have been rapidly building out our C-band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our company's history. We are tracking to 200 million POPs this quarter and are well ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POP targeted by year-end 2024. C-band propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale C-band quickly and efficiently, including in the 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-band spectrum later this year. Due to the timing of spectrum availability, our deployment strategy targets the highest usage areas first with the capability to deliver the most distinguished experience in places where the majority of our customers consume mobile services. As additional spectrum is cleared, we will have access to many new markets. As with prior generations of wireless technology, customers in all areas can expect to receive the best network experience. And where we have built out the C-band, we're only getting started. Early deployments have limited to 60 megahertz or 100 megahertz in some early clearance markets. Consumer performance in this market has been encouraging as is evidenced by better retention, more favorable gross add trends and higher premium uptake. In addition, the majority of our consumer fixed wireless net adds are on C-band. With the final tranche of spectrum expected to be available in late 2023, we can deploy an average of 161 megahertz and up to 200 megahertz in certain markets across the entire Continental U.S. When we turn on the full breadth of spectrum, we expect peak download speeds to reach 2.4 gigabits per second, up from the 900 megabits per second we see with 60 megahertz deployed, all while supporting far more users and applications. At the same time, we're also deploying our 5G standalone core. So by the end of the year, you should see a network with incredible speeds, both downlink and uplink and positioned to deliver 5G capabilities such as network slicing, voice over 5G NR among others. We believe our network will allow us to maintain our premium position with our wireless mobility customers and provide reliable fixed wireless access services to consumers and businesses across the country. This is an example of how we can monetize our multipurpose network by scaling several revenue streams on the same infrastructure to enhance our return on investment. We're adding far more capacity to our network than the peak usage increase we\u2019re expected in fixed wireless markets. We continue to expect that we will have 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless subscribers by the end of 2025, and those subscribers will be enabled by our current build and capital plans. Our mobility and broadband plans are supported by our deep fiber position and ongoing fiber investments. Approximately 50% of our sites are now served by our own fiber, up from 45% last year. We believe we are the only provider serving the level of its wireless network with its own fiber. This supports superior quality of services and end-to-end owners' economics. That means better reliability and higher margins and look for us to continue to expand the percentage of sites on our own fiber. We also expanded our FiOS footprint by over 550,000 locations in 2022, extending our FiOS open for sales to more than 17 million locations. You can expect continued fiber expansion in the years ahead. In summary, network quality is the foundation for our strategy and growth. And all of the moves we are making are focused on ensuring we continue our network leadership in the future. As I mentioned earlier, Verizon's success should be measured against three important metrics: service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Let me now cover each of these in detail and tell you why I'm so confident in our ability to deliver against all three of these benchmarks. We expect that our network differentiation will be the cornerstone of our service revenue growth and that it will allow us to continue to attract the highest quality customer base in the industry and maintain our market-leading share of the B2B market. Our fixed wire access is also expected to contribute more meaningfully to service revenue as we enter the year growing rapidly with a base of more than 1.4 million subscribers. 2022 demonstrated to us that we need to be even more agile and responsive in the consumer market. This is one of the reasons I assume leadership of the business late last year. We are moving into 2023 with momentum and expectation for improved performance based on recent actions and planned initiatives. After integrating TracFone over last year, we now have a full complement of offerings from entry-level prepaid all the way up to premium unlimited postpaid plans for the first time in our history. This will enable us to better attract new customers while also retaining customers through their mobile journey. You have already seen us take more segmented approach to the market through the Welcome Unlimited and One Unlimited plans in postpaid and the launch of Total by Verizon in prepaid. We're already seeing the benefit from these actions. In 2023, our plans will continue to evolve as we look for the best ways to cater to our customers, whether through network experience, content or other product offerings. Each new offering gives us an opportunity to engage with the prospective customers and ensure they receive a plan that best fits their needs. We remain disciplined around our core pricing and continue to perform well with our premium customers on retention and step-up activity. As we move into 2023, we're taking a more localized approach with our network and go-to-market strategy, providing greater autonomy to the teams on the front line and speeding up the pace of decision-making. This will allow us to compete more effectively across geographies, particularly where dynamics may differ by individual market. Finally, we continue to revise our sales compensation structure, ensuring we have the right incentives in place to drive sales growth. The customers we have and continue to attract represent the highest quality customer base in the industry. Based on our customer payment patterns, which are at or better than pre-pandemic levels, and the low delinquency rates in our securitized device payment plan portfolios, we continue to see only a limited impact from the macroeconomic environment on our customers. While we are watching this closely, we have a lot of confidence in the resilience of our customer base. Scaling of new business, such as private 5G networks and edge computing will also be a strategic focus in 2023. Our funnel is strong, and we're making the appropriate investment to ensure such services provide a meaningful contribution to future growth in the years ahead, which differentiates us in the industry. You can expect Verizon to compete, but I want to underline again that we will not sacrifice financial for volumes. We continue to focus on improving our cost of acquisition and retention and believe current promotional incentives are not sustainable for the industry in the long run. Although we have participated, to some extent, in this dynamic, expect us to pursue more ways to move away from the aggressive handset subsidies with offers like Welcome Unlimited plan, which offers attractive headline pricing for customers while reducing device subsidies. We manage the business for profitability and such actions drive healthy lifetime value for the business. Moving to Business Wireline. We're taking several actions to reduce the financial impact of the unit and are scaling back on pursuing low margin revenue in order to again drive improved profitability. While this may result in missing out on revenue, it is a right move and one that will lead to higher margin and cash flow over time. At the same time, we are focused on further improving the cost structure through greater efficiencies. You may recall that we embarked on a new cost-cutting initiative late last year. The component of this initiative is the formation of Verizon Global Services. This organization is accelerating efforts to drive cross-functional efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest savings in network superiority and customer growth while contributing to long-term profitability. Additional opportunity exists in sourcing, sales and marketing and corporate system, among others. The heavy lifting is now underway as we execute against our goal to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of run rate savings by 2025. So our EBITDA strategy is clear. Grow profitable volumes in both consumer and business based on our increasingly differentiated network and manage our expenses the way you would expect us to do. By growing service revenue and EBITDA, we believe that we will be able to provide our shareholders with increasingly healthy free cash flow, which will support the strength of our balance sheet and fund our dividend growth. Our current streak of raising the dividend 16 years in a row is unmatched in the industry, and we intend to be able to continue that trend. Because our mobility and fixed wireless access products leverage the same infrastructure, they provide a capital-efficient path to future cash flow growth. We believe that we will become increasingly efficient with our capital, using less capital to generate every dollar of revenue for years to come. That will enable us to produce expanding cash flow that we can both reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders. And as you know, we're doing all of this as our capital spending budget is expected to decline from $23.1 billion in 2022 to under $19 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range this year, a reduction of nearly 20% year-over-year. In 2024, we expect our CapEx to be around $17 billion, which we expect to represent the lowest capital intensity in over a decade and among the lowest in the industry. We expect we will deliver a best-in-class network experience while reducing our 2022 CapEx levels by more than $5 billion over the next couple of years. With that, I turn it over to Matt to discuss guidance.\nMatthew Ellis : Thank you, Hans, and good morning. I want to spend some time walking you through our 2023 guidance while also commenting on our longer-term outlook. Our 2023 guidance reflects momentum we have exiting 2022, which we expect to drive wireless service revenue growth. For 2023, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2.5% and 4.5%, driven by increased penetration of premium unlimited plans, scaling of fixed wireless, continued growth in products and services, such as content and device protection plans and the full year impact of our pricing actions taken in 2022. As noted in our earnings materials, our wireless service revenue growth outlook includes an approximately 190 basis point benefit from a larger allocation of our administrative and telco recover fees, which partially recovered network operating costs to wireless service revenue from other revenue. In addition, we expect promo amortization to be approximately $1 billion higher than last year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within a range of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue offset by wireline and other revenue declines and higher marketing and network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.55 to $4.85. As noted on our third quarter earnings call, high interest rates are expected to result in approximately $0.25 to $0.30 of interest expense pressure in 2023 due to higher floating rate debt costs and higher securitization costs for our growing device payment portfolio. We continue to believe we have the right debt structure for the long term and have managed the balance sheet appropriately by keeping short-term maturities to a minimum in this higher interest rate environment. Higher rates of pension and OPEB, in addition to the lower pension asset base resulting from negative returns in 2022, are also expected to impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.15 compared to 2022. This flows through other income and expense in our income statement. Finally, we expect approximately $0.03 to $0.05 of impact from higher depreciation expense primarily driven by the C-band equipment being put into service across '22 and into '23. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.0% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, including the final approximately $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion of C-band-related capital spending and we continue to expect total capital spending to be approximately $17 billion in 2024. The reduction from the $23.1 billion CapEx in 2022 is expected to drive higher free cash flow in 2023 despite increases in cash interest and cash taxes. As previously discussed, we will complete our accelerated $10 billion C-Band program this year after which all C-band capital expenditures will be part of our business-as-usual capital program. Looking beyond 2023, given our exit rate from 2022 we don't expect to hit the long-range outlook as we projected at the Investor Day last year. However, due to the way we have positioned our network and service offerings coming into 2023, we do expect increasing growth in revenue and cash flow in subsequent years. I will now turn it back over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Matt. Let me summarize the Verizon opportunity in a few key points. We are making the necessary improvements to drive better performance. We have the best network, and it's only getting better even as capital intensity improves. We have the largest EBITDA base in the industry and a clear path to free cash flow expansion. And finally, we have one of the most attractive dividends in the market and we intend to be able to continue the trend of growing the dividend each year. By that, I hand it over to Brady to start the Q&A.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions. .\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery : I had a couple of questions on the guidance. The first one is how are you thinking about your confidence and the visibility of this guide as compared to a year ago. Obviously, we had the war and stuff like that. But I think the reductions in guidance, obviously, were a concern for investors. So as you went through this process was it deliberate conservatism that you were trying to bake in to make sure that you could hit, and I think, Hans, you might have mentioned exceed the guidance with additional steps. So that kind of setup would be great. And then I guess for Matt, you called out some of the pressures on the bottom line, but you had a $0.30 range on your EPS guide. I think it was $0.15 a year ago. And it sounded like on the items you gave, the range wasn't that wide. So perhaps you can just give us some color on what caused you to be as wide this year on the EPS?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Simon. I can start. I mean when it comes to the guidance, I mean, we -- of course, it's a little bit uncertain, as we said, coming into the year, but we're laser focused on the service growth and on the EBITDA expansion and hence, also the cash flow expansion. And that's how we are running our business, and that's how we take decisions. And as I said, I mean, our job is, of course, to see that we are meeting or exceeding the guidance we've given out, and that's how we're going to work all the year. And our teams are set up to work like that. We are in the beginning of the year, so we're going to see how it turns out. But clearly, we have a super laser-focused in the whole company, how we're executing right now and how it hangs together.  And as I said before, we have now all the assets all the way from the network to our -- to the prepaid to the postpaid, all that. And from us, it's a lot of execution in a competitive market, but we definitely believe we can compete very well in that market. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Thanks, Hans. Good morning, Simon. So look, as you think about the guide for the year, obviously, there's a number of items in there, as I think about the range. We can get to the top end of the range there with strong execution, the activity around the cost program scaling, that flywheel moving faster than our base assumption. And just if we see more volumes come through the business there. Obviously, the low end will reflect the promo environment, the overall competitive environment and then we'll see items like inflation and so on. So the range of the EPS guide, I think very similar to the EBITDA guide that we've given. And I think it reflects as we come into this year, when you think about some of the unknowns will play out here in the macro environment and the competitive environment, we feel it's the right range to have for 2023. As Hans said, there's a lot of things for us to stay focused on, and make sure we produce the best result possible.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. \nJohn Hodulik : Can we talk about consumer margins within the guidance. They were down about almost 400 basis points in '22. And Matt and Hans, you guys gave some good color on some puts and takes around promotions around Verizon Global Services and I think, I guess, higher marketing and network operation cost. But I guess any other puts and takes to call out. And as we look into '23 as part of the guidance, should we expect the consumer margins to sort of flatten here? And do you guys have visibility that as you guys -- a lot of these initiatives take hold that we can start to see some improving margins on the consumer side?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. I mean, I can start. I mean, of course, we're doing quite a lot in the consumer segment right now, all the way from addressing areas where we have softness in our portfolio with Welcome, for example, in order to create growth. But also, we are regionalizing our business, both on the network side and the consumer side in order to take quicker decision, but also that the network is so strong in local markets where we're building out the C-band. We want to take advantage of that. And as we said before, we have the chance to -- or we don\u2019t have the chance. We see the correlation between C-band deployment and step-ups and of course, fixed wireless access and the majority of fixed wireless access customers coming on C-band right now. So that's why. And finally, we have also worked with the spending, the consumer investment, I call it, all the way what we're doing above the line on promo, what we're doing below the line on retention and how much we do in media. We're doing that much more agile. I think that will help us to manage and continue our clear path and a clear target of growing our top line and expanding our EBITDA. That's our job. Then there are some headwinds that Matt has talked about, but obviously, the underlying should be improving with the cost cuts and the way we're working in the consumer group. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. So as you think about the year-over-year reduction in '22. Remember, at the start of the year, we said that we expected about a 200 basis point impact because of the inclusion of TracFone in the business for the year. Obviously, accretive in absolute terms. But from a margin standpoint, we did expect to see that. So then obviously, there's some other items in there. We talked a little bit about the inflation impact last year. Obviously, the competitive environment and the promo piece in there as well. So there will be some things that we have the opportunity to improve on this year's synergies from within TracFone as we move more customers over to our own network will be an upside. But then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, obviously, the promo amortization is expected to be up on a year-over-year basis as the delay between being at these higher levels from a cash basis and then that flowing through on an accounting basis. So when you net those things out, expect something initially on a probably a similar type of level in '23 to '22 with some opportunities to push that as we go forward into subsequent years.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : I'm actually going to stick with consumer. And I was hoping we can get a little more insight into two different tools you're using to go to market. The first is Welcome Unlimited, you've been advertising it quite a bit, and you've mentioned it a couple of times during your prepared remarks. I'm wondering to what extent are you finding that Welcome Unlimited is indeed a popular plan with new consumers versus the extent to which it's driving wireless shoppers into your channels where you're actually more frequently converting them into a higher-tiered plans? That's the first question. And then it seems like you have been reluctant to make greater use of device promos. Obviously, you were using them to some extent last year. How are you thinking about the role of device promos as you go to market this year and you look to sort of sustain these positive consumer phone net adds?\nHans Vestberg : The Welcome Unlimited is working exactly as we wanted. I mean it creates the store traffic. We bring our customers in and we see that the customer gets the plans they want. We have not seen any step downs of -- that is coming from that. We are more seeing an opportunity for our customers to have a conversation with them. And of course, remember, that's a bring-your-own-device. It's for 4 lines, and that's the way we've been dealing. And we learned a lot from the first Welcome we started with somewhere in the third quarter, I remember or beginning of -- end of the second when we saw a little bit -- and that was an area where we were soft. That's where we clearly saw that customers were going to others. These we now have diverted and they come to us. And if you then add that, you see our premium unlimited continue to do well. We went up now to 45% actually from 41% in the third quarter, I think. So we added 4% more on unlimited premium. So that is working for us. Just need to be agile, stay close to see which segment and then be aggressive in the segment we need and the segment we're performing well and we let them continue to perform well. And when it comes to device promos, yes, we understand that's part of the competition and in part of the market. We will be in part in that as well. But we will continue to be cautious and see that we actually are using device promos in the right moment for the right customers. And you saw us last year coming in and out. Sometimes we're a little bit more aggressive and others, we were actually the least aggressive. And I think that's how we will continue this year depending on where the market is going. But what you can expect from us in the consumer unit is to be agile, take quick decisions and see if they're working, then we'll continue. If they're not working, we're pulling them. That's why I'm into this basically every day myself nowadays. And I think this has proven that we get the momentum with the team, and the team is actually executing well. We have more to do. I mean I always say that. I mean, it's going to take a long time before I feel that I'm 100% satisfied or happy, but definitely, it's a work to do here, but I've seen the good momentum.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick : Sticking with wireless on service revenue, when I pull out the definition change from other to service revenue, you're guiding to roughly 1% to 2% wireless service revenue growth in '23, which is a big deceleration from almost 6% this quarter. How should we think about this in regards to phone adds and ARPU and the impact of promotions on service revenue? Can you just put the pieces together for us? And do you expect that service revenue will stay positive each quarter this year or actually flips to negative at some point? And just on top of that, typically, we see things much slower in terms of subscribers from 4Q to 1Q, while I don't expect you to guide on subscribers, do you think we'll see sort of typical seasonality this quarter? Or do you anticipate sort of better performance?\nHans Vestberg : I can start, and then Matt can break down the numbers you're talking about. I mean, yes, on the premium segment, there is seasonality in the first quarter, and I don't think that's going to be different this year. However, our work is to keep up the momentum that we had from the fourth quarter into this year, where we had good store traffic quarter-over-quarter and also high conversion rate. But it also means that we need agile and see what's happening in the market. And it's a little bit early to do any guidance or something like that, which we're not doing on net adds. But clearly, there is going to be seasonality, but we have good momentum, and we're going to continue to execute and be very close to the market. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes, Phil, so kind of unpacking some of the piece parts of your question there. So seasonality, absolutely, we expect that to look reasonably as you would expect throughout the year from an overall standpoint.  In terms of the service revenue guide, your math there is correct. When you think about the fourth quarter, you said close to 6%. Remember that included a full quarter of owning Trac in 4Q this year versus only part of 4Q last year. So as we get into '23, finally on a year-over-year basis to talk about stuff on an apples-to-apples basis and not with and without M&A items, which is nice. So once you remove that very similar.  In terms of the piece parts within wireless service revenue guide, think about you got the positive impacts of the price ups. Obviously, we had six months impact last year, approximately, you get a full year impact this year. Also the benefit of the FWA momentum we had and having 1.4 million subscribers in the base at the start of this year that we're billing throughout the year. But that's offset by the promo amortization, which, as I mentioned in the upfront comments will be higher in the income statement year-over-year, with the timing of the recognition of that. And then also the impact of the volumes last year, offsetting some of the ARPA benefit we had. So the task for the team going forward is to continue the momentum that we started to see in the second half of last year, as Hans mentioned, and that will put us in a position to continue to push service revenue in the positive direction going forward.\nOperator: The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden : The first one, maybe, Matt, could we refresh the free cash flow outlook for 2023? I think the midpoint was $21 billion for 2023 from last year's Analyst Day. I think if we look at the EBITDA guidance, which is roughly flat; interest expense guidance, which is up $1 billion; the CapEx, which is down $4 billion, it feels like it should be roughly $17 billion, unless there's other things in taxes and working capital related to some of these promotions. So if you could kind of refresh that a little bit, that would be awesome. And then Hans, you called out three things as it relates to the C-band deployment. And this has been a big success for Verizon is getting this build done. I think that some people have been asking themselves like where the return is from all the money that's been spent. And you highlighted higher retention, better gross adds and higher premium take rate. Are there numbers that you can put around that, that we could grab on to and say, \"Oh, when in 2024, Verizon doubles their footprint in C-band with the new spectrum getting cleared, we can put a number on that and say, \"Oh, this is going to be the return that Verizon gets from this build?\"\nHans Vestberg : Why don't you start, Matt, and I take the second question on the C-band.\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. So on the free cash flow, David, obviously, last year, we said that we expect -- you had the right number expectation of where we said free cash flow might be for \u201823. As I think about where we see the business today versus where it was a year ago, a couple of factors that are different. CapEx very much in line with where we thought it would be at this point. Team did a great job last year deploying C-band. And obviously, we spent most of the $10 billion. So you get a nice year-over-year benefit. Offsetting that cash taxes will be higher this year as we have less benefit from a higher CapEx number and also bonus depreciation dropping down. That was in our expectation last year. Interest rates were obviously very different than we expected last year. You touched on those. And then the jump-off point from the EBITDA in the business at the end of '22 to '23 lower than we hoped to be at the Investor Day a year ago. So you've got the right moving parts there. We're not guiding specifically to a cash flow number. We historically haven't. But you've got the right moving pieces in there. So net-net, the CapEx reduction year-over-year gives us a good tailwind to think about cash flow for this year. So with that, I'll hand you to Hans for the C-band question.\nHans Vestberg : Yes. And it's, of course, a focus for us to continue to grow the cash flow, as I said so many times. So we will continue on that work. When it comes to the C-band, first of all, we have said from the beginning, the C-band acquisition we did is a multi-decade spectrum. It's going to -- it's so much and in so many years. And of course, that was a deliberate decision because we believe we're going to be in wireless business for the eternity of Verizon's history. So that's very important. However, when it comes to C impacts, and I think I mentioned some of them, if you think about fixed wireless access, the majority of all new customers are coming on the C-band right now. That's a clear indication. Without the C-band, we couldn't grow the broadband right now. We did a history high 1.4 billion net adds in the year of broadband subscribers. So of course, a lot of contributor to C-band, and that's a clear metric to have. The other metrics you have is, of course, unlimited premium, where we say that actually, we're performing very well where we have deployed a C-band in order to get customers to step up. And the step-up is very important. We are in a multi-subscription business or we are in a subscription business. And the more you can see that you're upgrading the price, the P on that quantity, it's enormously important for a long-term value for our customers, important. The third one that is coming, and I mentioned also when I opened is, of course, private 5G networks, mobile edge compute, all that is, of course, going to be very much supported by the C-band as well. There we will come back and start reporting on that when we feel that, that is coming into the play from a more significant portion. But mobility -- and remember also that we had the wireless business side, the business side actually growing because of the reliability of our network and the resilience of our network, which is how our enterprise customers are buying from us when it comes to wireless business. So I think there are many metrics that you can see already now that is really connected to the C-band. Then I just want to remind you it's almost less -- I think it's one year since we got -- since we launched the C-band. It's only one year, and we're going to cross 200 million POPs. We have never built so fast in the entire history of the company, and we're well ahead of the plan to hit the 250 million POPs that we said at Investor Day by end of '24. So I think that this is really a game changer in the market. And we see performance-wise, we're outperforming. We have the most resilient 5G network in the nation and we are just starting, just starting with 60 and 100 megahertz. And as you heard me talking, we have 160 in average, it's going to be 200 later on. It is a game changer, and we can already see it right now, and we see already metrics right now that is proving it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. I'm sorry, Michael Rollins of Citibank, your lines is open.\nMichael Rollins : Two questions, if I could. The first one, as you mentioned earlier in the discussion that you pulled back from some of those longer-term targets that you had previously you added the 3-plus percent service revenue and other growth for this year and 4-plus percent for next year. Can you unpack the categories that are at or above the plan from a few years ago? And then the areas of shortfall and if those areas, do you view those as temporary or more permanent changes in the opportunity for Verizon?\nHans Vestberg : I can start. I mean, first of all, we're more confident than ever that we have the right strategy and we have the five vectors of growth. All of them are going along. Some are actually exceeding our expectations, some are a little bit slower and some have a little bit different jump-off points. That's where we are. But there's no difference how we see the market and how we believe we can compete in all the five vectors of growth that we outlined in the last time. It's more a push in time than something else because of this year or this year, in '22, I guess, I should say, had some jump off that is not really helping us. But all in all, the whole strategy, where we're going, I have a lot of confidence in our team. The team has a lot of confidence that we're executing. We're eliminating the things that have been distracting us, all the ways from Verizon Media Group, et cetera. Then we have some headwinds that we constantly work with as well that we don't talk so much about. On the wireline side, I talked about that today. I mean everything from the cost out. But not only that, we're going to be even more prudent, what type of business we're taking, which will reduce our top line probably, but it will improve our profitability and cash flow. So you're going to see us taking many actions to see that we are delivering on the long-term plans, but there are some shifts in it. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Mike, as you think about the conversation we had last year and we talked about the long-term outlook, we provided the piece parts. Maybe if I go through some of those and where we are. Some of them were absolutely where we expected to be. Think about nationwide broadband with the year we had on FWA, but also FiOS and the expectation to continue to see very good progress there. That's very much in line with the expectations we outlined a year ago. Also, our business segment mobility results with six consecutive quarters above 150,000 net adds, very much in line with the expectations that we had at the Investor Day.  A couple of areas where we are behind versus our expectation at that point in time. Firstly, you need to think one of them, the mobile edge compute and 5G private networks. You're talking about the technology adoption there on a new technology, that adoption curve. A little slower than maybe we would have liked, but as you heard from Hans in the prepared remarks, feel enough we're starting to see some momentum there. So I still feel good about the opportunity there, but the pace of the adoption curve a little different than we hoped it might be. But the upside there still looks very good. And then, of course, the other one, consumer mobility at this time a year ago, we had higher expectations for '22 than where we ended up. Obviously, a lot of that variance occurred in the first part of the year, and you saw the actions taken, but as you think about the piece parts of the long-term outlook that we described a year ago and then how those have played out in the past 12 months. Hopefully, that gives you a little more color in terms of where things are moving along very much in line and where we also saw some areas where we had to -- we have opportunity to see further improvement as we go forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.\nCraig Moffett : Sorry, I hope you can hear me. So Hans, I wonder if you could just talk a bit about your bundling strategy, particularly on the consumer side, with both the strength now in fixed wireless, but also FiOS. Is it your view that going forward, the consumer is going to buy wireless and wireline or fixed access together? Or is that more of a sort of a financial bundling strategy rather than a real product bundling strategy?\nHans Vestberg : Craig. No, I think it's a really good question. Of course, we have seen this has a very strong consumer movement in Europe that is, to a high degree, have convergence in the U.S. where, I would say, much lower. But clearly, it is something that our customers are asking for. So it's actually a consumer feedback. And I spent a lot of time in the stores, meeting a lot of our consumers. And they see a clear advantage to have the same provider on the broadband as on the wireless. I don't think we will get into any European levels. But clearly, this is a movement and Verizon is super good positioned here. We have owner's economics on our broadband and on our wireless nationwide, both of them. And that's, of course -- we're going to meet the customers here. If the customer thinks that is what they need, we're going to offer it, and that's why we have these bundles in the market. If they want to have them separate, we can do that as well. We have owners economics on both of them. But I think that trend will continue given the consumer research we're doing and the consumers we\u2019re talking to. That's something that is actually -- and it's not only consumers, you need to think about small and medium business as well, make it convenient for them, both having the wireless and the broadband. Because any SMB today -- and you know we spend -- we probably serve half of the SMBs in the country. Any SMB today need a digital front door and then being mobile first. So this is really good for us. And if you look at our numbers this year on both on fixed wireless access and mobility in the business segment, SMB has been very important for us. So yes, I think there's something in there definitely, and it's a consumer desire, and we're going to meet that desire as we continue.\nCraig Moffett : And are there big differences between the way you think about it in FiOS versus non-FiOS markets?\nHans Vestberg : No, it's not different. We see it in the same way if the customer, of course, we're much more mature historically in the FiOS footprint. On the other side, when we do fixed wireless access, it's a much more natural discussion with the customer as we have it from the beginning. So I would say that we probably have a big opportunity on the FiOS segment to have customers, both on the fixed and the mobile. On the fixed wireless access, I think that there, you start actually on a strong position when you start offering fixed wireless access with many of the customers sort of coming in either or cable provider and have our wireless, and that's how they move over to us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar : Hans, when we think about the balance between unit growth versus pricing, and obviously, there you have made a deliberate choice not to chase unit growth in near term. But could you help us think through how you think about this longer term? Because once you cede market share, obviously, it can be pretty expensive to get it back. And so when we think about this balance between pricing and unit growth, how important is unit growth, not just for short term, as you look at 2023, but also longer term, especially when it comes to postpaid phone growth.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. No, good question. I think that as you heard us at least, I mean, we think that the profitable growth is the most important, both to have the right customers retained with us and the ones we're getting. So that's an overarching measurement we need to have. Then, of course, it's always going to be new customers that are important for our base. But remember also, this market right now, if you talk about the premium segment, there are, of course, a certain amount of switchers in the market, and then there are a certain amount of people going from pre to postpaid. That is no infusion of new customers in the system. So they're coming from two sources. And you need to think about how you do that. And I think we have great opportunities right now with the TracFone brands we have to see and total wireless to see that we are taking care of that pre to post migration, which we've not been part of before. We still have some work with the IT stacks and all of that. But clearly, today, we're running on both sides. And on the switcher pool, yes, there we're going to be seeing that we're prudent and disciplined, but we will go for the units we think are the right. It's a subscription model long term that is even more important to increase the P sometimes than increasing the Q because this is long term that you stay with the customers to get the long-term value from them. But it's a balance of it all the time and that we will continue to have.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson : You talked about amortization being up $1 billion for phone subsidies to catch up with cash spending. Embedded in all your guidance is cash spending at peak levels? Is there a scope for it still to go higher? I know it depends on the competitive environment that it could eventually improve. But are we at peak levels, and it's just a question of amortization catching up. And I'm curious, when you think about the service revenue guide for wireless, are there any price increases anticipated in that guide? And kind of what level of price increase? I know it's a sensitive topic, but just curious how we should think about that revenue growth.\nHans Vestberg : Now if we talk about the price increases, I just want to come back to what I said before. I mean we will be surgical and segmented in our approach. There are certain segments we need to be more aggressive on. There might be areas where we see opportunities for price increases. There are no major price increases included at this moment. We need to see where the market is going and also where the cost levels are going. But we will always look at that, but it's nothing right now that we have in our plans. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. On the promotion piece, you've got the understanding of the accounting treatment versus the cash there, Doug, and certainly, our assumption is that the marketplace will continue to be competitive, but we're not going to go into the 100% details of what's in the guide there. But we do assume that we'll continue to see competitive level in line with the past couple of years. And then as Hans said, we'll continue to look for ways to put plans in the marketplace to reduce the level of subsidy out there as well, and we'll continue to push those opportunities.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. \nTim Horan : Matt, can you talk about your goals for free cash flow? And specifically, how much do you think you can reduce the debt buy per year kind of going forward at this point? And then secondly, can you talk about the gating factor for fixed wireless growth it seems like you're implying with your '25 guidance that this is kind of a good run rate, but yet your speeds are going to be increasing threefold and coverage, you're going to basically get a massive amount of capacity kind of going out there. But do you think this is a good run rate for fixed wireless or can accelerate?\nHans Vestberg : I can start with fixed wireless access. First of all, we just reiterated what we said in Investor Day, 4 million to 5 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. Our job is always to try to beat that, but that was -- we just reiterated that, and we are well ahead on that plan.  Then the second is, of course, when it comes to our capacity, we have definitely capacity for that and much more. And again, we have a multi-usage of our network that has been sort of the basis for this, meaning the same radio base stations are serving mobility, fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute, and we are not doing separate. In the distant future way above the 4 and 5, we can always come into sort of decisions of splitting cells in order to get more fixed wireless access but that\u2019s very far away from now. We have ample capacity for the guide and much more than that. So -- and of course, our team is doing everything to see that we can continue to exceed our targets.\nMatthew Ellis : Hey, Tim, on the free cash flow question. So absolutely, one of our goals is to continue to grow cash flow. Hans mentioned that you should measure us on revenue growth, EBITDA growth and cash flow growth and that cash flow growth is something we expect to be able to continue to generate going forward. Obviously, the capital reduction from the high point in '22 to the guide we gave for this year and then an even lower amount next year will be a positive towards that as we continue to obviously make progress on the income statement as well. You should see that contribute there as well. So that puts us in a position where we can start to see accelerated levels of debt reduction versus what you've seen in the past year or so. So that's the targets we have ahead of us and look forward to discussing progress against as we go forward here.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Great. Thanks, Tim. Brad, we've got time for on3 more question.\nOperator: The final question for today will come from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft : I wanted to ask you about business postpaid phone net adds. They seem to be a bit lighter this quarter than they've been in the past four or five quarters. And I'm just wondering if you're seeing trends there soften due to macroeconomic factors such as corporate staff reductions or if it's competitive reasons? Or is it any slowdown in the secular trend toward company-issued devices? And then related to that, can you talk about what you're assuming in the guidance at a high level for the macroeconomic environment. For example, are you assuming soft landing scenario with small macro impact? Or are you baking in a more protracted downturn in the guidance?\nHans Vestberg : Yes. So it's a multifaceted question on the fourth quarter. Of course, on the business-to-business side, SMBs continue very strong. And as I said, they need store digital storefront and a mobile-first strategy in today's world after COVID. So I think that we have been performing very well. On the enterprise side, it's a little bit different, but we see that bring your own device is going down, and we see more companies saying that they want the company phone, which is of course, helping us here. And that we -- that trend we have seen for a couple of quarters. So I think both of them are pretty solid. On the consumer side, as I said, we had positive net adds. We had also, as I said before, a little bit spill over from the churn from the price increase at the beginning of the quarter. And then there was actually fewer days of sales in the fourth quarter than a normal quarter. So I don't think there are any new things more than what I said. Customers were a little bit later in the holiday season to do. They had higher intent when it comes to consumers, but it was nothing macroeconomical different than I talked about. Matt and I talked about the bad debt and the delinquency being like pre-COVID or equal or better than pre-COVID. So no, there's nothing there. We are, of course, watching it. But so far, we continue to progress well.\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Just to add on a couple of points. As you think about the VBG net adds, you're always going to see a little bit of volatility up and down from 1 quarter to the next just because of the size of some of the transactions there. So all in all, though, jobs numbers continue to be good; business numbers, good. Obviously, there's been some high-profile layoff announcements, but overall job numbers are good, and you see that show up in the overall numbers that we produced throughout the year and look forward to continuing to have best-in-class market share within the Verizon Business Group space as we go forward. In terms of the macroeconomic assumptions in the guide, I wouldn't say we have anything too dissimilar to what you've heard from a number of other people during earnings season. But one of the things I come back to is the resiliency of our customer base. We've been through different types of economic environments in the past. We know customers pay their phone bills before they pay other bills and other outgoings. We fully expect that to continue. And so we're obviously watching the macroeconomic environment. But as Hans said, the payment patterns continue to be very strong, and we'll stay close to that, but so far, so good.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Bryan. Brad, that's all the time we have today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

            "name": "Matthew Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans, and good morning. I want to spend some time walking you through our 2023 guidance while also commenting on our longer-term outlook. Our 2023 guidance reflects momentum we have exiting 2022, which we expect to drive wireless service revenue growth. For 2023, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2.5% and 4.5%, driven by increased penetration of premium unlimited plans, scaling of fixed wireless, continued growth in products and services, such as content and device protection plans and the full year impact of our pricing actions taken in 2022. As noted in our earnings materials, our wireless service revenue growth outlook includes an approximately 190 basis point benefit from a larger allocation of our administrative and telco recover fees, which partially recovered network operating costs to wireless service revenue from other revenue. In addition, we expect promo amortization to be approximately $1 billion higher than last year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within a range of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue offset by wireline and other revenue declines and higher marketing and network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.55 to $4.85. As noted on our third quarter earnings call, high interest rates are expected to result in approximately $0.25 to $0.30 of interest expense pressure in 2023 due to higher floating rate debt costs and higher securitization costs for our growing device payment portfolio. We continue to believe we have the right debt structure for the long term and have managed the balance sheet appropriately by keeping short-term maturities to a minimum in this higher interest rate environment. Higher rates of pension and OPEB, in addition to the lower pension asset base resulting from negative returns in 2022, are also expected to impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.15 compared to 2022. This flows through other income and expense in our income statement. Finally, we expect approximately $0.03 to $0.05 of impact from higher depreciation expense primarily driven by the C-band equipment being put into service across '22 and into '23. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.0% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, including the final approximately $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion of C-band-related capital spending and we continue to expect total capital spending to be approximately $17 billion in 2024. The reduction from the $23.1 billion CapEx in 2022 is expected to drive higher free cash flow in 2023 despite increases in cash interest and cash taxes. As previously discussed, we will complete our accelerated $10 billion C-Band program this year after which all C-band capital expenditures will be part of our business-as-usual capital program. Looking beyond 2023, given our exit rate from 2022 we don't expect to hit the long-range outlook as we projected at the Investor Day last year. However, due to the way we have positioned our network and service offerings coming into 2023, we do expect increasing growth in revenue and cash flow in subsequent years. I will now turn it back over to Hans. Thanks, Hans. Good morning, Simon. So look, as you think about the guide for the year, obviously, there's a number of items in there, as I think about the range. We can get to the top end of the range there with strong execution, the activity around the cost program scaling, that flywheel moving faster than our base assumption. And just if we see more volumes come through the business there. Obviously, the low end will reflect the promo environment, the overall competitive environment and then we'll see items like inflation and so on. So the range of the EPS guide, I think very similar to the EBITDA guide that we've given. And I think it reflects as we come into this year, when you think about some of the unknowns will play out here in the macro environment and the competitive environment, we feel it's the right range to have for 2023. As Hans said, there's a lot of things for us to stay focused on, and make sure we produce the best result possible. Yes. Thanks, Hans. So as you think about the year-over-year reduction in '22. Remember, at the start of the year, we said that we expected about a 200 basis point impact because of the inclusion of TracFone in the business for the year. Obviously, accretive in absolute terms. But from a margin standpoint, we did expect to see that. So then obviously, there's some other items in there. We talked a little bit about the inflation impact last year. Obviously, the competitive environment and the promo piece in there as well. So there will be some things that we have the opportunity to improve on this year's synergies from within TracFone as we move more customers over to our own network will be an upside. But then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, obviously, the promo amortization is expected to be up on a year-over-year basis as the delay between being at these higher levels from a cash basis and then that flowing through on an accounting basis. So when you net those things out, expect something initially on a probably a similar type of level in '23 to '22 with some opportunities to push that as we go forward into subsequent years. Yes, Phil, so kind of unpacking some of the piece parts of your question there. So seasonality, absolutely, we expect that to look reasonably as you would expect throughout the year from an overall standpoint.  In terms of the service revenue guide, your math there is correct. When you think about the fourth quarter, you said close to 6%. Remember that included a full quarter of owning Trac in 4Q this year versus only part of 4Q last year. So as we get into '23, finally on a year-over-year basis to talk about stuff on an apples-to-apples basis and not with and without M&A items, which is nice. So once you remove that very similar.  In terms of the piece parts within wireless service revenue guide, think about you got the positive impacts of the price ups. Obviously, we had six months impact last year, approximately, you get a full year impact this year. Also the benefit of the FWA momentum we had and having 1.4 million subscribers in the base at the start of this year that we're billing throughout the year. But that's offset by the promo amortization, which, as I mentioned in the upfront comments will be higher in the income statement year-over-year, with the timing of the recognition of that. And then also the impact of the volumes last year, offsetting some of the ARPA benefit we had. So the task for the team going forward is to continue the momentum that we started to see in the second half of last year, as Hans mentioned, and that will put us in a position to continue to push service revenue in the positive direction going forward. Yes. So on the free cash flow, David, obviously, last year, we said that we expect -- you had the right number expectation of where we said free cash flow might be for \u201823. As I think about where we see the business today versus where it was a year ago, a couple of factors that are different. CapEx very much in line with where we thought it would be at this point. Team did a great job last year deploying C-band. And obviously, we spent most of the $10 billion. So you get a nice year-over-year benefit. Offsetting that cash taxes will be higher this year as we have less benefit from a higher CapEx number and also bonus depreciation dropping down. That was in our expectation last year. Interest rates were obviously very different than we expected last year. You touched on those. And then the jump-off point from the EBITDA in the business at the end of '22 to '23 lower than we hoped to be at the Investor Day a year ago. So you've got the right moving parts there. We're not guiding specifically to a cash flow number. We historically haven't. But you've got the right moving pieces in there. So net-net, the CapEx reduction year-over-year gives us a good tailwind to think about cash flow for this year. So with that, I'll hand you to Hans for the C-band question. Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Mike, as you think about the conversation we had last year and we talked about the long-term outlook, we provided the piece parts. Maybe if I go through some of those and where we are. Some of them were absolutely where we expected to be. Think about nationwide broadband with the year we had on FWA, but also FiOS and the expectation to continue to see very good progress there. That's very much in line with the expectations we outlined a year ago. Also, our business segment mobility results with six consecutive quarters above 150,000 net adds, very much in line with the expectations that we had at the Investor Day.  A couple of areas where we are behind versus our expectation at that point in time. Firstly, you need to think one of them, the mobile edge compute and 5G private networks. You're talking about the technology adoption there on a new technology, that adoption curve. A little slower than maybe we would have liked, but as you heard from Hans in the prepared remarks, feel enough we're starting to see some momentum there. So I still feel good about the opportunity there, but the pace of the adoption curve a little different than we hoped it might be. But the upside there still looks very good. And then, of course, the other one, consumer mobility at this time a year ago, we had higher expectations for '22 than where we ended up. Obviously, a lot of that variance occurred in the first part of the year, and you saw the actions taken, but as you think about the piece parts of the long-term outlook that we described a year ago and then how those have played out in the past 12 months. Hopefully, that gives you a little more color in terms of where things are moving along very much in line and where we also saw some areas where we had to -- we have opportunity to see further improvement as we go forward. Yes. On the promotion piece, you've got the understanding of the accounting treatment versus the cash there, Doug, and certainly, our assumption is that the marketplace will continue to be competitive, but we're not going to go into the 100% details of what's in the guide there. But we do assume that we'll continue to see competitive level in line with the past couple of years. And then as Hans said, we'll continue to look for ways to put plans in the marketplace to reduce the level of subsidy out there as well, and we'll continue to push those opportunities. Hey, Tim, on the free cash flow question. So absolutely, one of our goals is to continue to grow cash flow. Hans mentioned that you should measure us on revenue growth, EBITDA growth and cash flow growth and that cash flow growth is something we expect to be able to continue to generate going forward. Obviously, the capital reduction from the high point in '22 to the guide we gave for this year and then an even lower amount next year will be a positive towards that as we continue to obviously make progress on the income statement as well. You should see that contribute there as well. So that puts us in a position where we can start to see accelerated levels of debt reduction versus what you've seen in the past year or so. So that's the targets we have ahead of us and look forward to discussing progress against as we go forward here. Yes. Just to add on a couple of points. As you think about the VBG net adds, you're always going to see a little bit of volatility up and down from 1 quarter to the next just because of the size of some of the transactions there. So all in all, though, jobs numbers continue to be good; business numbers, good. Obviously, there's been some high-profile layoff announcements, but overall job numbers are good, and you see that show up in the overall numbers that we produced throughout the year and look forward to continuing to have best-in-class market share within the Verizon Business Group space as we go forward. In terms of the macroeconomic assumptions in the guide, I wouldn't say we have anything too dissimilar to what you've heard from a number of other people during earnings season. But one of the things I come back to is the resiliency of our customer base. We've been through different types of economic environments in the past. We know customers pay their phone bills before they pay other bills and other outgoings. We fully expect that to continue. And so we're obviously watching the macroeconomic environment. But as Hans said, the payment patterns continue to be very strong, and we'll stay close to that, but so far, so good."

            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone. On today's earnings call, I will focus on our strategy, guidance, expectation for the business and why I'm so excited about the opportunities for the year ahead.  Let me start by saying that we delivered against all of our revised financial targets provided in July, including 8.6% wireless service revenue growth, $47.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $5.18. I'm pleased that the momentum built during the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we set the expectation of a positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter, and we delivered against that expectation. Although we have more work to do, I'm encouraged by the improvement and expect to build on the momentum in 2023. The improvement in the consumer performance was complemented by yet another strong mobility quarter in Verizon Business Group as well as continued success in fixed wireless access with net adds up sequentially in both consumer and business. Together with FiOS result, we added 416,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, our best total broadband performance in over a decade and approximately 1.3 million total broadband net adds for the year. Regarding our guidance, we have positioned ourselves to improve on our performance in 2023 and expect to build a good underlying operational momentum, although that will be offset by the impact of the noncash factors, such as promo amortization in our revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, we're seeing some impact of high interest rates. At the same time, we expect our capital spending to reduce significantly in 2023 as we reach the end of our incremental C-band spending, which will be a tailwind for free cash flow. We're striving to make further improvement and take even more actions that will ultimately lead to better performance than the guidance we have outlined today. Matt will discuss the guidance in more detail later in the call. The industry enters 2023 with continued macroeconomic uncertainty as elevated inflation and interest rates impact the broader economy. Still, demand for our service remains strong, given the growing importance of mobility and broadband to both consumers and businesses. The combination of our network reliability, diverse portfolio of products and services and the industry's strongest customer base provides us the flexibility to meet the changing customer needs even in a difficult economic environment. We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders by our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Taking these three metrics together is how we hold ourselves accountable. We're well positioned to improve our performance and accelerate growth on a go-forward basis with network quality as the foundation for our strategy and growth. We expect the wireless mobility and nationwide broadband will be the most significant contributor to Verizon's growth for the next several years. In 2022, we made important progress in each of these businesses. Our growth in these areas will be driven by extending our network advantage using our C-band spectrum, which we expect will strengthen our network leadership in the coming years. We are taking a balanced approach on how we run our business, adding the right customers and generating ongoing profits from them is how we maximize value. We remain focused on our cost reduction and efficiency actions, while also maximizing our return on invested capital via better monetizing our assets to put us on track to improve free cash flow going forward. We're proud of being the strongest in the industry in terms of generating cash and want to preserve that while also continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We're executing with discipline and will continue driving a strategy which produces sustainable long-term growth and profitability.  As connectivity plays an increasingly important role for consumers and businesses, it is the quality of the connectivity that matters the most. Not all networks are architected and built the same, nor have the same quality. We have seen these differences in the past and expect that 5G will be no different. Our engineers have the best track record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity where needed and filling service gaps where they exist even as capital intensity declines in the coming years. In the shift to 5G, we have been rapidly building out our C-band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our company's history. We are tracking to 200 million POPs this quarter and are well ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POP targeted by year-end 2024. C-band propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale C-band quickly and efficiently, including in the 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-band spectrum later this year. Due to the timing of spectrum availability, our deployment strategy targets the highest usage areas first with the capability to deliver the most distinguished experience in places where the majority of our customers consume mobile services. As additional spectrum is cleared, we will have access to many new markets. As with prior generations of wireless technology, customers in all areas can expect to receive the best network experience. And where we have built out the C-band, we're only getting started. Early deployments have limited to 60 megahertz or 100 megahertz in some early clearance markets. Consumer performance in this market has been encouraging as is evidenced by better retention, more favorable gross add trends and higher premium uptake. In addition, the majority of our consumer fixed wireless net adds are on C-band. With the final tranche of spectrum expected to be available in late 2023, we can deploy an average of 161 megahertz and up to 200 megahertz in certain markets across the entire Continental U.S. When we turn on the full breadth of spectrum, we expect peak download speeds to reach 2.4 gigabits per second, up from the 900 megabits per second we see with 60 megahertz deployed, all while supporting far more users and applications. At the same time, we're also deploying our 5G standalone core. So by the end of the year, you should see a network with incredible speeds, both downlink and uplink and positioned to deliver 5G capabilities such as network slicing, voice over 5G NR among others. We believe our network will allow us to maintain our premium position with our wireless mobility customers and provide reliable fixed wireless access services to consumers and businesses across the country. This is an example of how we can monetize our multipurpose network by scaling several revenue streams on the same infrastructure to enhance our return on investment. We're adding far more capacity to our network than the peak usage increase we're expected in fixed wireless markets. We continue to expect that we will have 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless subscribers by the end of 2025, and those subscribers will be enabled by our current build and capital plans. Our mobility and broadband plans are supported by our deep fiber position and ongoing fiber investments. Approximately 50% of our sites are now served by our own fiber, up from 45% last year. We believe we are the only provider serving the level of its wireless network with its own fiber. This supports superior quality of services and end-to-end owners' economics. That means better reliability and higher margins and look for us to continue to expand the percentage of sites on our own fiber. We also expanded our FiOS footprint by over 550,000 locations in 2022, extending our FiOS open for sales to more than 17 million locations. You can expect continued fiber expansion in the years ahead. In summary, network quality is the foundation for our strategy and growth. And all of the moves we are making are focused on ensuring we continue our network leadership in the future. As I mentioned earlier, Verizon's success should be measured against three important metrics: service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Let me now cover each of these in detail and tell you why I'm so confident in our ability to deliver against all three of these benchmarks. We expect that our network differentiation will be the cornerstone of our service revenue growth and that it will allow us to continue to attract the highest quality customer base in the industry and maintain our market-leading share of the B2B market. Our fixed wire access is also expected to contribute more meaningfully to service revenue as we enter the year growing rapidly with a base of more than 1.4 million subscribers. 2022 demonstrated to us that we need to be even more agile and responsive in the consumer market. This is one of the reasons I assume leadership of the business late last year. We are moving into 2023 with momentum and expectation for improved performance based on recent actions and planned initiatives. After integrating TracFone over last year, we now have a full complement of offerings from entry-level prepaid all the way up to premium unlimited postpaid plans for the first time in our history. This will enable us to better attract new customers while also retaining customers through their mobile journey. You have already seen us take more segmented approach to the market through the Welcome Unlimited and One Unlimited plans in postpaid and the launch of Total by Verizon in prepaid. We're already seeing the benefit from these actions. In 2023, our plans will continue to evolve as we look for the best ways to cater to our customers, whether through network experience, content or other product offerings. Each new offering gives us an opportunity to engage with the prospective customers and ensure they receive a plan that best fits their needs. We remain disciplined around our core pricing and continue to perform well with our premium customers on retention and step-up activity. As we move into 2023, we're taking a more localized approach with our network and go-to-market strategy, providing greater autonomy to the teams on the front line and speeding up the pace of decision-making. This will allow us to compete more effectively across geographies, particularly where dynamics may differ by individual market. Finally, we continue to revise our sales compensation structure, ensuring we have the right incentives in place to drive sales growth. The customers we have and continue to attract represent the highest quality customer base in the industry. Based on our customer payment patterns, which are at or better than pre-pandemic levels, and the low delinquency rates in our securitized device payment plan portfolios, we continue to see only a limited impact from the macroeconomic environment on our customers. While we are watching this closely, we have a lot of confidence in the resilience of our customer base. Scaling of new business, such as private 5G networks and edge computing will also be a strategic focus in 2023. Our funnel is strong, and we're making the appropriate investment to ensure such services provide a meaningful contribution to future growth in the years ahead, which differentiates us in the industry. You can expect Verizon to compete, but I want to underline again that we will not sacrifice financial for volumes. We continue to focus on improving our cost of acquisition and retention and believe current promotional incentives are not sustainable for the industry in the long run. Although we have participated, to some extent, in this dynamic, expect us to pursue more ways to move away from the aggressive handset subsidies with offers like Welcome Unlimited plan, which offers attractive headline pricing for customers while reducing device subsidies. We manage the business for profitability and such actions drive healthy lifetime value for the business. Moving to Business Wireline. We're taking several actions to reduce the financial impact of the unit and are scaling back on pursuing low margin revenue in order to again drive improved profitability. While this may result in missing out on revenue, it is a right move and one that will lead to higher margin and cash flow over time. At the same time, we are focused on further improving the cost structure through greater efficiencies. You may recall that we embarked on a new cost-cutting initiative late last year. The component of this initiative is the formation of Verizon Global Services. This organization is accelerating efforts to drive cross-functional efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest savings in network superiority and customer growth while contributing to long-term profitability. Additional opportunity exists in sourcing, sales and marketing and corporate system, among others. The heavy lifting is now underway as we execute against our goal to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of run rate savings by 2025. So our EBITDA strategy is clear. Grow profitable volumes in both consumer and business based on our increasingly differentiated network and manage our expenses the way you would expect us to do. By growing service revenue and EBITDA, we believe that we will be able to provide our shareholders with increasingly healthy free cash flow, which will support the strength of our balance sheet and fund our dividend growth. Our current streak of raising the dividend 16 years in a row is unmatched in the industry, and we intend to be able to continue that trend. Because our mobility and fixed wireless access products leverage the same infrastructure, they provide a capital-efficient path to future cash flow growth. We believe that we will become increasingly efficient with our capital, using less capital to generate every dollar of revenue for years to come. That will enable us to produce expanding cash flow that we can both reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders. And as you know, we're doing all of this as our capital spending budget is expected to decline from $23.1 billion in 2022 to under $19 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range this year, a reduction of nearly 20% year-over-year. In 2024, we expect our CapEx to be around $17 billion, which we expect to represent the lowest capital intensity in over a decade and among the lowest in the industry. We expect we will deliver a best-in-class network experience while reducing our 2022 CapEx levels by more than $5 billion over the next couple of years. With that, I turn it over to Matt to discuss guidance. Thank you, Matt. Let me summarize the Verizon opportunity in a few key points. We are making the necessary improvements to drive better performance. We have the best network, and it's only getting better even as capital intensity improves. We have the largest EBITDA base in the industry and a clear path to free cash flow expansion. And finally, we have one of the most attractive dividends in the market and we intend to be able to continue the trend of growing the dividend each year. By that, I hand it over to Brady to start the Q&A. Thank you, Simon. I can start. I mean when it comes to the guidance, I mean, we -- of course, it's a little bit uncertain, as we said, coming into the year, but we're laser focused on the service growth and on the EBITDA expansion and hence, also the cash flow expansion. And that's how we are running our business, and that's how we take decisions. And as I said, I mean, our job is, of course, to see that we are meeting or exceeding the guidance we've given out, and that's how we're going to work all the year. And our teams are set up to work like that. We are in the beginning of the year, so we're going to see how it turns out. But clearly, we have a super laser-focused in the whole company, how we're executing right now and how it hangs together.  And as I said before, we have now all the assets all the way from the network to our -- to the prepaid to the postpaid, all that. And from us, it's a lot of execution in a competitive market, but we definitely believe we can compete very well in that market. Matt? Thank you. I mean, I can start. I mean, of course, we're doing quite a lot in the consumer segment right now, all the way from addressing areas where we have softness in our portfolio with Welcome, for example, in order to create growth. But also, we are regionalizing our business, both on the network side and the consumer side in order to take quicker decision, but also that the network is so strong in local markets where we're building out the C-band. We want to take advantage of that. And as we said before, we have the chance to -- or we don't have the chance. We see the correlation between C-band deployment and step-ups and of course, fixed wireless access and the majority of fixed wireless access customers coming on C-band right now. So that's why. And finally, we have also worked with the spending, the consumer investment, I call it, all the way what we're doing above the line on promo, what we're doing below the line on retention and how much we do in media. We're doing that much more agile. I think that will help us to manage and continue our clear path and a clear target of growing our top line and expanding our EBITDA. That's our job. Then there are some headwinds that Matt has talked about, but obviously, the underlying should be improving with the cost cuts and the way we're working in the consumer group. Matt? The Welcome Unlimited is working exactly as we wanted. I mean it creates the store traffic. We bring our customers in and we see that the customer gets the plans they want. We have not seen any step downs of -- that is coming from that. We are more seeing an opportunity for our customers to have a conversation with them. And of course, remember, that's a bring-your-own-device. It's for 4 lines, and that's the way we've been dealing. And we learned a lot from the first Welcome we started with somewhere in the third quarter, I remember or beginning of -- end of the second when we saw a little bit -- and that was an area where we were soft. That's where we clearly saw that customers were going to others. These we now have diverted and they come to us. And if you then add that, you see our premium unlimited continue to do well. We went up now to 45% actually from 41% in the third quarter, I think. So we added 4% more on unlimited premium. So that is working for us. Just need to be agile, stay close to see which segment and then be aggressive in the segment we need and the segment we're performing well and we let them continue to perform well. And when it comes to device promos, yes, we understand that's part of the competition and in part of the market. We will be in part in that as well. But we will continue to be cautious and see that we actually are using device promos in the right moment for the right customers. And you saw us last year coming in and out. Sometimes we're a little bit more aggressive and others, we were actually the least aggressive. And I think that's how we will continue this year depending on where the market is going. But what you can expect from us in the consumer unit is to be agile, take quick decisions and see if they're working, then we'll continue. If they're not working, we're pulling them. That's why I'm into this basically every day myself nowadays. And I think this has proven that we get the momentum with the team, and the team is actually executing well. We have more to do. I mean I always say that. I mean, it's going to take a long time before I feel that I'm 100% satisfied or happy, but definitely, it's a work to do here, but I've seen the good momentum. I can start, and then Matt can break down the numbers you're talking about. I mean, yes, on the premium segment, there is seasonality in the first quarter, and I don't think that's going to be different this year. However, our work is to keep up the momentum that we had from the fourth quarter into this year, where we had good store traffic quarter-over-quarter and also high conversion rate. But it also means that we need agile and see what's happening in the market. And it's a little bit early to do any guidance or something like that, which we're not doing on net adds. But clearly, there is going to be seasonality, but we have good momentum, and we're going to continue to execute and be very close to the market. Matt? Why don't you start, Matt, and I take the second question on the C-band. Yes. And it's, of course, a focus for us to continue to grow the cash flow, as I said so many times. So we will continue on that work. When it comes to the C-band, first of all, we have said from the beginning, the C-band acquisition we did is a multi-decade spectrum. It's going to -- it's so much and in so many years. And of course, that was a deliberate decision because we believe we're going to be in wireless business for the eternity of Verizon's history. So that's very important. However, when it comes to C impacts, and I think I mentioned some of them, if you think about fixed wireless access, the majority of all new customers are coming on the C-band right now. That's a clear indication. Without the C-band, we couldn't grow the broadband right now. We did a history high 1.4 billion net adds in the year of broadband subscribers. So of course, a lot of contributor to C-band, and that's a clear metric to have. The other metrics you have is, of course, unlimited premium, where we say that actually, we're performing very well where we have deployed a C-band in order to get customers to step up. And the step-up is very important. We are in a multi-subscription business or we are in a subscription business. And the more you can see that you're upgrading the price, the P on that quantity, it's enormously important for a long-term value for our customers, important. The third one that is coming, and I mentioned also when I opened is, of course, private 5G networks, mobile edge compute, all that is, of course, going to be very much supported by the C-band as well. There we will come back and start reporting on that when we feel that, that is coming into the play from a more significant portion. But mobility -- and remember also that we had the wireless business side, the business side actually growing because of the reliability of our network and the resilience of our network, which is how our enterprise customers are buying from us when it comes to wireless business. So I think there are many metrics that you can see already now that is really connected to the C-band. Then I just want to remind you it's almost less -- I think it's one year since we got -- since we launched the C-band. It's only one year, and we're going to cross 200 million POPs. We have never built so fast in the entire history of the company, and we're well ahead of the plan to hit the 250 million POPs that we said at Investor Day by end of '24. So I think that this is really a game changer in the market. And we see performance-wise, we're outperforming. We have the most resilient 5G network in the nation and we are just starting, just starting with 60 and 100 megahertz. And as you heard me talking, we have 160 in average, it's going to be 200 later on. It is a game changer, and we can already see it right now, and we see already metrics right now that is proving it. I can start. I mean, first of all, we're more confident than ever that we have the right strategy and we have the five vectors of growth. All of them are going along. Some are actually exceeding our expectations, some are a little bit slower and some have a little bit different jump-off points. That's where we are. But there's no difference how we see the market and how we believe we can compete in all the five vectors of growth that we outlined in the last time. It's more a push in time than something else because of this year or this year, in '22, I guess, I should say, had some jump off that is not really helping us. But all in all, the whole strategy, where we're going, I have a lot of confidence in our team. The team has a lot of confidence that we're executing. We're eliminating the things that have been distracting us, all the ways from Verizon Media Group, et cetera. Then we have some headwinds that we constantly work with as well that we don't talk so much about. On the wireline side, I talked about that today. I mean everything from the cost out. But not only that, we're going to be even more prudent, what type of business we're taking, which will reduce our top line probably, but it will improve our profitability and cash flow. So you're going to see us taking many actions to see that we are delivering on the long-term plans, but there are some shifts in it. Matt? Craig. No, I think it's a really good question. Of course, we have seen this has a very strong consumer movement in Europe that is, to a high degree, have convergence in the U.S. where, I would say, much lower. But clearly, it is something that our customers are asking for. So it's actually a consumer feedback. And I spent a lot of time in the stores, meeting a lot of our consumers. And they see a clear advantage to have the same provider on the broadband as on the wireless. I don't think we will get into any European levels. But clearly, this is a movement and Verizon is super good positioned here. We have owner's economics on our broadband and on our wireless nationwide, both of them. And that's, of course -- we're going to meet the customers here. If the customer thinks that is what they need, we're going to offer it, and that's why we have these bundles in the market. If they want to have them separate, we can do that as well. We have owners economics on both of them. But I think that trend will continue given the consumer research we're doing and the consumers we're talking to. That's something that is actually -- and it's not only consumers, you need to think about small and medium business as well, make it convenient for them, both having the wireless and the broadband. Because any SMB today -- and you know we spend -- we probably serve half of the SMBs in the country. Any SMB today need a digital front door and then being mobile first. So this is really good for us. And if you look at our numbers this year on both on fixed wireless access and mobility in the business segment, SMB has been very important for us. So yes, I think there's something in there definitely, and it's a consumer desire, and we're going to meet that desire as we continue. No, it's not different. We see it in the same way if the customer, of course, we're much more mature historically in the FiOS footprint. On the other side, when we do fixed wireless access, it's a much more natural discussion with the customer as we have it from the beginning. So I would say that we probably have a big opportunity on the FiOS segment to have customers, both on the fixed and the mobile. On the fixed wireless access, I think that there, you start actually on a strong position when you start offering fixed wireless access with many of the customers sort of coming in either or cable provider and have our wireless, and that's how they move over to us. Thank you. No, good question. I think that as you heard us at least, I mean, we think that the profitable growth is the most important, both to have the right customers retained with us and the ones we're getting. So that's an overarching measurement we need to have. Then, of course, it's always going to be new customers that are important for our base. But remember also, this market right now, if you talk about the premium segment, there are, of course, a certain amount of switchers in the market, and then there are a certain amount of people going from pre to postpaid. That is no infusion of new customers in the system. So they're coming from two sources. And you need to think about how you do that. And I think we have great opportunities right now with the TracFone brands we have to see and total wireless to see that we are taking care of that pre to post migration, which we've not been part of before. We still have some work with the IT stacks and all of that. But clearly, today, we're running on both sides. And on the switcher pool, yes, there we're going to be seeing that we're prudent and disciplined, but we will go for the units we think are the right. It's a subscription model long term that is even more important to increase the P sometimes than increasing the Q because this is long term that you stay with the customers to get the long-term value from them. But it's a balance of it all the time and that we will continue to have. Now if we talk about the price increases, I just want to come back to what I said before. I mean we will be surgical and segmented in our approach. There are certain segments we need to be more aggressive on. There might be areas where we see opportunities for price increases. There are no major price increases included at this moment. We need to see where the market is going and also where the cost levels are going. But we will always look at that, but it's nothing right now that we have in our plans. Matt? I can start with fixed wireless access. First of all, we just reiterated what we said in Investor Day, 4 million to 5 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. Our job is always to try to beat that, but that was -- we just reiterated that, and we are well ahead on that plan.  Then the second is, of course, when it comes to our capacity, we have definitely capacity for that and much more. And again, we have a multi-usage of our network that has been sort of the basis for this, meaning the same radio base stations are serving mobility, fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute, and we are not doing separate. In the distant future way above the 4 and 5, we can always come into sort of decisions of splitting cells in order to get more fixed wireless access but that's very far away from now. We have ample capacity for the guide and much more than that. So -- and of course, our team is doing everything to see that we can continue to exceed our targets. Yes. So it's a multifaceted question on the fourth quarter. Of course, on the business-to-business side, SMBs continue very strong. And as I said, they need store digital storefront and a mobile-first strategy in today's world after COVID. So I think that we have been performing very well. On the enterprise side, it's a little bit different, but we see that bring your own device is going down, and we see more companies saying that they want the company phone, which is of course, helping us here. And that we -- that trend we have seen for a couple of quarters. So I think both of them are pretty solid. On the consumer side, as I said, we had positive net adds. We had also, as I said before, a little bit spill over from the churn from the price increase at the beginning of the quarter. And then there was actually fewer days of sales in the fourth quarter than a normal quarter. So I don't think there are any new things more than what I said. Customers were a little bit later in the holiday season to do. They had higher intent when it comes to consumers, but it was nothing macroeconomical different than I talked about. Matt and I talked about the bad debt and the delinquency being like pre-COVID or equal or better than pre-COVID. So no, there's nothing there. We are, of course, watching it. But so far, we continue to progress well."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now, let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.17 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported third quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $881 million. This includes a net pre-tax charge of approximately $645 million, primarily related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities and the impacts of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions of $236 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.32 in the third quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the third quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Last quarter, we told you we would take actions. Today, I am here to share the results those actions have delivered. We ended the third quarter with wireless service revenue growth up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially and adjusted EBITDA grew sequentially by almost 3% to $12.2 billion. We had total phone gross adds of nearly 2.6 million and about 5% year-over-year increase. This includes an increase in consumer of 1.3%, a significant improvement from minus 11% in the second quarter. These results are early indicators that the actions we are taking across our businesses to build momentum are gaining traction. Of course, we are not done yet. I continue to work with my team to take actions to grow revenue and to take cost out of our business to unlock the full potential of Verizon. I am glad to see sequential improvements based on our efforts, but there is more to do. Based on our momentum and plans, our financial guidance for 2022 remains unchanged. Throughout the call, you will hear the actions we took and the impact they have had on our business to position Verizon for growth. Our pricing actions in the second quarter in both our consumer and business groups helped increase our wireless service revenue. Postpaid phone net adds came in 8,000 for the quarter, with a loss from consumer offset by gains in Verizon Business. Matt will share more details with you later in the call. Let me turn to some of our group results. In Consumer, we have started to gain traction with customers reacting positively to our new offerings and as a result, increased store traffic. Our Welcome plan improved customers\u2019 pricing perception and contributed to consumer phone gross adds being up year-over-year. With the launch of the iPhone 14, we delivered a first-of-its-kind Apple 1 Unlimited bundle. Verizon customers now have access to Apple services all under one subscription. Apple remains a unique and trusted partner of Verizon, because they recognize our network quality and high-value customers. In the value segment, we launched Total By Verizon, redefining no contract wireless service, a key step in our continued integration of TracFone. And just this week, we introduced a prepaid wireless home Internet service on our Straight Talk brand. We continue to expand our offerings in the value segment and customers are taking notice. This helped also generate positive prepaid net adds for the quarter, our first positive quarter since second quarter 2021. For postpaid, we are focused on attracting and retaining high-quality consumers in a disciplined and measured approach. As we see areas of opportunity, we will address them in a surgical manner just like we have done with some of our recent actions. There is more progress to make. Our premium strategy is working. We ended the third quarter with 53% of our customers having a 5G phone and 81% of our base is on Unlimited plans. With a 42% uptake on Premium Unlimited, there is a great opportunity for step-ups. And we see that demand with approximately 60% of our new customers choosing Premium Unlimited right from the start. It is clear we have a high-quality customer base, so we will continue to focus on retention and winning these customers. Moving to Verizon Business, we see a continued very good momentum in both fixed wireless access and mobility. And I am encouraged also by the large 5G infrastructure deals we made in the quarter. These include digital transformation projects with Astellas Pharmaceuticals, Fujifilm and our continued work with the Department of Defense. And this is just a start. We recently announced an important agreement with the U.S. Department of State to modernize its communications infrastructure across embassies and other locations around the world. I am proud that we are partner of choice for these global enterprises and public sector clients. In broadband, our fixed wireless access and fire service continued to see strong demand. Total broadband net adds were 377,000, a sequential growth of over 40%. All of these services are built to deliver on top of our world-class network. We have a premium network and experience that our customers value and that demands premium pricing. Our network is a core value proposition. America relies on us and we deliver. This was evident before, during and in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. Our team did what we always do. We ran to the crisis, quickly restoring our network as needed and using our technology solution to protect impacted areas. Bottom line, our network infrastructure was resilient and our people delivered in the way that you have come to expect from us. Our mission has always been to build and operate the best, most reliable, highest performing network. Our use of advanced technologies, our spectrum portfolio and our expansive own fiber footprint, are critical to achieving that goal. Where we deploy our C-band, we see direct correlation to customer growth on both mobility and fixed wireless access. We are currently covering over 160 million POPs with C-band and on track to deliver 200 million within the first quarter of 2023. C-band usage is up 170% quarter-over-quarter and fixed wireless access now covers more than 40 million households. Right now, more than 48% of our cell sites are connected by Verizon\u2019s own fiber. We are expecting to be about 50% by year-end with the majority of our 5G sites already on our own fiber. This not only improves network performance, but also improves our owners\u2019 economics. At the same time, we are making efforts to take cost out of our business. We are constantly thinking about how we run our enterprise everyday to enhance our performance while delivering on our strategy. In this period, we have designed a company-wide cost savings program that we expect will save between $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2025. A first step in these efforts is the creation of a global service organization under the leadership of Craig Silliman. This is one part of our larger program to leverage cross-functional opportunities across the business. Over the past 2 years, under unprecedented circumstances, we have learned a lot about how we deliver our services to customers. Verizon global services will help unlock significant efficiencies and reduce cost across the business. Keeping in line with our company values and strategy, we continue to practice financial discipline even in a competitive market and delivered solid financial performance quarter-over-quarter. Verizon is in a strong position, no matter economical environment with our high-quality customer base, diversified go-to-market options, including our value offering, that benefits from strengthening our organization through our cost savings program and the best network that just keeps getting better. I will now hand it over to Matt to go deeper into our results.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans and good morning everyone. Our results from the third quarter were not yet where we would like them to be. But as you heard from Hans, the actions we have taken in the past two quarters are gaining traction in the marketplace. As a result, we saw positive developments in store traffic and consumer phone gross adds further gains in broadband and a sequential improvement in our financial results. We anticipate that we will be able to build on this momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s now walk through results from the third quarter, beginning with an overview of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our strategy for mobility growth is to drive revenue growth by attracting and retaining high-quality customers and migrating them into premium tiers. Premium penetration in the consumer segment increased to approximately 42% at quarter end, a sequential increase in line with prior quarters even with the introduction of the Welcome plan and the current economic backdrop. As a result of the continued increase in Premium plan penetration, combined with the benefit from our admin fee increase and the impact from metered price-ups, consumer postpaid ARPA increased 3.8% year-over-year. Overall, phone gross adds were up approximately 5% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in business as well as the improvement in consumer gross adds. With the impact of 3Q churn, which increased as expected as a result of our recent pricing actions, phone net adds were 8,000 for the quarter. Business delivered 197,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter, their fifth consecutive quarter exceeding 150,000. The results were again balanced across the three customer groups, with enterprise delivering their best-ever phone net add performance and SMB and public sector both seeing double-digit phone gross add growth. On the Consumer side, postpaid phone gross adds were up 1.3% year-over-year, a notable sequential improvement from an 11% decline in Q2. The launch of the Welcome plan and the Apple One Unlimited plan helped to generate more store traffic while providing another avenue to compete outside of promotional spend. We have now seen year-over-year improvement in phone gross add performance for four consecutive months through September and anticipate another low single-digit year-over-year growth performance in the fourth quarter. As expected, the pricing actions we took around administrative fees and metered plans led to an increase in disconnects. With certain price-ups being phased in throughout the third quarter, we would anticipate some disconnect pressure to carryover into Q4. Taken together, we currently expect the gross add and disconnect performance to result in positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. Total broadband net adds were 377,000 in the quarter, reflecting a strong demand for reliable and high-value broadband offerings. Fixed wireless access momentum continued throughout the third quarter. We added 342,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in 2Q, reflecting increased demand across business and consumers. More than 75% of our consumer net adds are coming from urban and suburban locations with data usage that continues to mirror our Fios customers. We anticipate further share gains in this space as we continue to expand our household coverage and begin to realize benefits from our offering in the prepaid segment. We also added 61,000 Fios Internet net adds during the third quarter, reflecting improved gross outperformance from Q2 as well as continued strong retention levels. Our ability to grow Fios in spite of some secular headwinds due to lower move activity shows that the quality, value and reliability that Fios offers, continues to resonate strongly with customers. We further expanded our nationwide broadband opportunity by adding more fixed wireless households and businesses covered as well as growing our Fios open-for-sale within our ILEC footprint. Total fixed wireless household coverage surpassed 40 million in the quarter, including over 30 million covered by 5G Ultra Wideband. Fios open for sale is now at 16.9 million, a year-to-date increase of 410,000 and we remain on track to hit our full year target of 550,000. Now, let\u2019s talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our work to integrate TracFone continues, highlighted by the launch of our new prepaid brand, Total By Verizon, late in the quarter as well as the launch of fixed wireless for our prepaid customers earlier this month. For the quarter, we delivered positive prepaid net adds of 39,000, which excludes a base adjustment of 102,000 primarily relating to a competitor\u2019s 3G network shutdown. We saw significant improvement in TracFone\u2019s performance, which had positive net adds for the first time since Q1 2021. With our current momentum, combined with the launch of our new brand and fixed wireless, we are excited about our positioning and ability to further grow in the value market, bringing more connectivity and benefits to customers in this space. Now, let\u2019s move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was up 4.0% year-over-year as wireless service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue more than offset wireline declines and the net impact of last year\u2019s M&A activity. As a reminder, the third quarter last year only had 2 months of Verizon Media activity before its divestiture. Total wireless service revenue growth was up 10.0% from the prior year primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, continued effectiveness of our Premium Unlimited strategy and business volumes. The core business is strong as wireless service revenue, excluding all TracFone activities, grew above 3%. Additionally, we saw a benefit from the pricing actions taken earlier in the year, which we previously said would generate roughly $1 billion across Q3 and Q4. These actions helped to generate a sequential increase of $494 million in wireless service and other revenue and an increase of $345 million of adjusted EBITDA as total adjusted EBITDA came in at $12.2 billion for the quarter. We continue to feel the pressures of higher device subsidies and promotional spending despite taking steps throughout Q3 to be disciplined, including the launch of the Welcome plan, which comes with our device subsidy. Inflationary pressures remain elevated both from a year-over-year and sequential point of view with the increase from Q2 primarily coming from higher electricity rates. Expectations for full year 2022 impacts of inflation remain consistent with comments during our Q2 earnings call. To further mitigate inflation impacts, we have started a new cost savings program that we expect will provide a reduction in annual cost of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2025. This program will be focused on several areas within the business, including digitalization efforts to enhance the customer experience and streamlining internal operations through automation and process enhancements. While part of this will benefit the bottom line, a portion of these savings will be reinvested into the business to help accelerate opportunities. As Brady noted, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.32. In addition to the impact from EBITDA, this reflects sequential pressures in interest expense due to rate increases and a reduction in other income associated with non-cash changes to pension and OPEB. Based on year-to-date interest rate increases and market expectations for additional Federal Reserve actions this year, we now estimate cash interest expense for 2022 to be about $400 million higher than our expectation coming into the year. We anticipate this pressure will continue into next year given the full year impact from interest rate increases, providing an EPS headwind in 2023. Likewise, the impact from non-cash pension cost due to higher interest rates and lower return on assets this year is expected to put additional pressure on below-the-line items for 2023. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our third quarter consumer financial results. Total consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.8% year-over-year driven by wireless service revenue growth of 11.0% as well as higher equipment revenue. Wireless service revenue increases were the result of the inclusion of TracFone, core wireless service revenue growth and the impact of the pricing actions. Total Fios revenue was up versus the same period a year ago by 0.3% as growth from our Internet base offset the revenue impact of a 9% year-over-year decline in video subscribers. Fios content costs have also dropped resulting in an improved margin profile that we expect will continue to benefit from further shifts away from video. Consumer EBITDA was $10.6 billion, up 0.7% compared to the same period last year. The pricing actions as well as the full inclusion of TracFone results more than offset the pressures from higher promotional activity and the impact of inflation. Next, let\u2019s take a closer look at the Business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment\u2019s wireless results remained strong in 3Q, though wireline service revenue declines continued due to ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 5.7% was up from 3.0% last quarter, aided by pricing actions as well as continued growth in our customer base. Wireline revenue declined by 6.7% versus prior year. Operating trends are consistent with prior quarters. Though in Q3, we saw a sequential increase in USF revenue due to higher rates. Business EBITDA was $1.8 billion for the quarter, down 6.7% from the prior year. In addition to pressure from wireline, we experienced higher growth related costs as wireless sales volumes were up by 15% from the prior year. Now let\u2019s move on to Slide 13 and the cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three quarters of 2022 totaled $28.2 billion compared with $31.2 billion in the prior year period as working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased inventory levels continue, as we expected. Capital spending for the first three quarters of the year totaled $15.8 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to last year. C-band spending was $4.5 billion for the first 9 months of the year. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $12.4 billion for the first three quarters of the year. We exited the quarter with $129.3 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement of $1.3 billion, resulting in a net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. As Hans mentioned earlier, our low unsecured bond maturities over the remainder of this year and next and strong operational cash flow generation puts our balance sheet in a strong position. Payment trends remain at or better than pre-COVID levels, and the quality of our postpaid base has never been better as evidenced by recent asset-backed securities prospectus filings. As we look at Q3 results, we delivered the sequential revenue and EBITDA growth that we had anticipated from the actions taken in 2Q. Our guidance for 2022 remains unchanged. We are building momentum and remain confident that our strategy will deliver strong cash flow growth into the future. It is this confidence, combined with the health of our balance sheet, that enabled us to recently increase our dividend for the 16th consecutive year. We recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders, and we intend to continue to put the Board in a position to approve annual increases. I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to questions. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. The actions we have taken are showing progress, but there is more work to be done. Our priorities through the end of the year and into 2023 are straightforward: continue our traction in Consumer wireless through the holiday season and into 2023; maintain and grow our momentum in fixed wireless access and Business wireless; implement the initial framework of a cross-functional efficiency program and improve our working capital efficiencies; and finally, continue our measured and strategic approach to the market with financial discipline and increased momentum for the quarters to come. While there is work to be done, I\u2019m confident that we are well positioned to deliver. So thank you. Now we\u2019re ready for your questions. Brady, back to you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we\u2019re ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. Two quick ones, if I can. First, I know you guys don\u2019t \u2013 you often hold off on giving guidance until the fourth quarter call, but it sounds like you got a number of sort of below-the-line headwinds to growth next year. But what\u2019s the prognosis for EBITDA growth in \u201823 given all the moving parts and all the cost savings you have coming through? And then secondly, on postpaid phone churn, it ticked up. And just looking for clarifications on Matt\u2019s comments that it\u2019s going to stay elevated. How do you expect that to progress as we move through \u201823? And what do you think is really driving? It sounds like you obviously you had the price increase. But just fundamentally, are the prices at Verizon just too high at this point given what we\u2019re seeing from a macro environment and given the \u2013 something approaching network parity that we have in the market today? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, John. I can start and Matt will fill in. I mean when it comes to the quarter and the gross adds and the churn, I think what happened is that we came out from the second quarter where the soft quarter on the Consumer side when it comes to gross adds. We added a couple of new products all the way from the Welcome plan to the price adjustments. And of course, the outcome we were expecting was that we continue to grow both ARPA, but also our wireless service revenue. And as you heard, we grew the service revenue with 3.5% if we exclude TracFone, but then with TracFone. So that clearly is working for us, and we will continue to do that. But we will do it in certain segments where we see weakness. I mean we also saw a very strong continuation in our premium segments, where we continue to have now more than 81% of consumers on unlimited and 42% on Unlimited Premium. So we \u2013 that area is going well. So we just need to find those areas, and we will continue to do that. But I think that we have a very competitive pricing in the market. We add that with values like the one plan with Apple right now at Apple One Unlimited, et cetera, and we have more to come. So it\u2019s \u2013 for us it\u2019s a grind it to see that we do the right in the segment. And of course, we have the largest consumer base in the market. So we just need to see that we\u2019re doing this in the right way. And ultimately, our goal is to continue to grow our EBITDA. And you saw this quarter, we grew our EBITDA ;with almost 3%. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and we keep our guidance for the full year. So we \u2013 that\u2019s our job. And then on top of that, we take out costs. So I think all in all, that\u2019s what we\u2019re working with constantly here. And it\u2019s a big ship we\u2019re moving. I think that this quarter, we saw all the actions we took in the second quarter having impact \u2013 positive impact. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re done. We think we can do more and we have more to do. So that\u2019s sort of the summary of where I think we are and how we\u2019re executing, and we will continue to execute in this quarter and the quarters to come.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. And John, so maybe the second part of your question first around churn and is our pricing in the right place, I\u2019d point you to the fact that our gross adds were up almost 5% on a year-over-year basis in 3Q. So obviously, our offerings continue to resonate with customers, obviously, built on having the best network, and consumers continue to see the value of that. So continue to believe that the gross add traffic will be there, and we will get our fair share. On the churn side, just to put it in perspective, the pricing actions we took across both the metered plans and the fees touch more than 75 million phone customers. And so the uptick in churn that we saw in the quarter was highly expected. We kind of mentioned that 90 days ago that we expected it to happen. But the financial benefits came through as well, which was exactly as we expected and was the right approach to take. So obviously, the impact of those changes will mitigate as we go forward here, and we will continue to make sure that our churn is where it needs to be to ensure the right results. In terms of the first part of your question, you\u2019re right, we will speak to you more specifically about 2023 on the next call. We\u2019re obviously in the middle of our planning cycle right now. But you should certainly expect us to build on the momentum that you saw us deliver in the third quarter. You saw that wireless service revenue up sequentially 2%. As Hans mentioned, EBITDA up sequentially about 3%, that gives us a good platform to build on here in 4Q and then as we head into \u201823. And then you mentioned below the line, there will be some pressures next year. I\u2019m not going to quantify those now. But as you think about the specifics of those, some of those we\u2019ve spoken to all of you about before. When we came out of the C-band auction, we said that we would expect depreciation to increase and capitalized interest to reduce as we\u2019ve deployed C-band sites and put them on there and really having kind of significant year-over-year impacts in \u201823 and \u201824. So that\u2019s in line with what we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. And then you layer on top of that, obviously, interest rates are higher, and we will have a full year impact of that next year. And that impacts both the interest expense line, but also other non-cash below-the-line items around pension and OPEB, where the imputed interest cost will be higher with the higher macro rates and then also starting the year with lower assets because of the performance this year. So we will obviously quantify those things. But as we think about \u201823, we had good momentum coming out of 3Q on a sequential basis, look to build on that in 4Q, continue to generate significant amounts of cash flow that puts us in a position to be successful going forward.\nJohn Hodulik: All right. Thanks for all the detail, guys.\nHans Vestberg: Yes.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, John. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. It\u2019s about your sort of emerging nationwide broadband strategy. So I think you mentioned that you can now offer the fixed wireless product to over 40 million potential customers. I think from your Analyst Day last year, the ultimate target is 64 million with 50 million of that being residential and the rest being business. You\u2019re also \u2013 and you made a point about this, you\u2019re deploying a lot of fiber, primarily just to put your mobile network on a national basis. And so the real question is, now that you have seen the fixed wireless product perform and what it does on the network side of things, how are you thinking about that target of eventually reaching 64 million homes? You think it could potentially be greater? And then yesterday, AT&T talked about evaluating opportunities to do more of a fiber-to-the-home strategy out of region. I imagine leveraging some of the fiber they are deploying in their wireless network. Considering how expansive your national fiber footprint is becoming, is that something you\u2019re evaluating as well? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brett. When it comes to our national broadband strategy, first of all, I think it\u2019s working really good for us. You saw in the quarter adding 377,000. The Fios footprint continue to be extremely high-quality customers and continue to grow. We will continue to expand that footprint. Outside that, we, of course, have a very high focus on fixed wireless access because the speed to market, because the demand in the market right now is high for broadband. And of course, we have a very disruptive model where it takes low single digits minutes to actually get broadband at home. It\u2019s a total different product when it comes to fixed wireless access. So we capture the market as soon as we can right now, and you see on our growth rates that is happening both for Consumer as for Business. But as you rightfully said, we are deploying the network as we speak, and we are just into certain markets given on the C-band, we will have more and more markets. And as we stated in the remarks, I mean, we are now covering 40 million households with our fixed wireless access. So we will continue to expand that, and we have plans and execution. It\u2019s working well. The quality is improving. The customer satisfaction is really high on fixed wireless access and of course, there are the competition in these areas are of course not equally good customer satisfaction. So no, I think \u2013 we think \u2013 we are confident that this is a good strategy for us. Then when it comes to our fiber, you\u2019re absolutely right. We have done enormous investment in fiber. We want owners\u2019 economics on our network, and we are getting that because with the majority of all the 5G sites have our own fiber, and we\u2019re now passing 50% by year-end on all our sites. Some sites will never need fiber. So it\u2019s not like 100% is the end goal. But in order to have a good experience for our customers, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Then we want to see opportunities, especially for the Business side to use that fiber footprint outside. I\u2019d like to see that some customers can get a better or we can substitute third-party fiber that we are getting from others. But clearly, focus on fiber in the Fios footprint, fixed wireless access going as fast as we can outside that. So yes, we are confident about the strategy, and it\u2019s working. We have talked about for several years. We come out with new products, that\u2019s going to be multi-spectrum. That\u2019s going to handle everything from 4G, C-band, 10-millimeter wave. So the resilience and the performance and quality of the products is even getting better. So yes, that\u2019s where we are.\nMatt Ellis: Brad, I\u2019ll just add one thing. You mentioned fiber to the home. Of course, our Fios team had another good quarter here, 61,000 net adds despite a low-mover environment. So as Hans said, we\u2019re very focused on doing broadband through fixed wireless access, but our Fios business continues to perform very strongly and add customers to that network. And we continue to build more open for sale in our Fios footprint. And just as a point to note, 3Q was a milestone for Fios in terms of going over 7 million connections with \u2013 for that business. So it continues to perform very strongly. And then we supplement it with fixed wireless access around the rest of the country.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Matt, a quick one for you. Any changes to the 2023 CapEx guidance you gave out for that significant drop from this year? And then more broadly, back in March, you talked about a clear path to 4% plus revenue growth in 2024 and beyond. Could you maybe update us on how that looks, how the kind of things like mobile edge compute, B2B applications are scaling and what you can do to get there and give us more visibility around that?\nHans Vestberg: Yes. I can start on the enterprise side with the mobile edge compute, which we \u2013 and the private 5G networks. As I said a couple of times before \u2013 right now, we had three different sort of use cases on the edge computing: one was private networks, another was public mobile edge compute, and the third was the private 5G mobile edge compute. We see clearly a very strong demand on the private 5G networks, which is the prelude to go into all others, and the funnel is strong. And we talked about a couple of examples this quarter which we have gained. And it\u2019s a normal typical enterprise or B2B cycle, where you start with one proof of concept, then you start deploying it, and then you roll it out. So that\u2019s going to continue to happen over the years is, of course, not going to be any significant revenues in the short-term. But over time, we\u2019re building a totally new opportunity for Sapa and his team to be with customers in larger sort of turnkey projects to reform and transform their digital asset for enterprises. So we are still really confident this is a good strategy for us. And it\u2019s \u2013 again, we\u2019re building on the same network. We built a network once, and we have several different use cases where the mobility and now the fixed wireless access both are going in a high speed. And now we\u2019re adding the mobile edge compute that\u2019s starting to get off to a good start, especially with private 5G networks, and then we move into mobile edge compute. So that\u2019s how I see that market continue for us.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Simon, so your first question around CapEx, obviously, we will be more specific on \u201823 guidance in January, but nothing has changed around our view of CapEx. So very much in line and that\u2019s because of the great work the team has done this year. I mean we said we\u2019d be at 175 million POPs covered by the end of the year. As you heard Hans say earlier, already at more than 160 million through 3Q. Not only will we be ahead of the 175 million, but we will be at 200 million at some point during the first quarter, so phenomenal speed that the team has built the network there. That means a significant chunk of the $10 billion CapEx for C-band will have been covered between last year and this year. So it will just be a small stub piece of that left next year and then we will be at those BAU levels that we\u2019ve spoken to all of you about numerous times. In terms of the longer term revenue growth, I mean, obviously, we will come back to that, but certainly encouraged by what we saw in the third quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, wireless service revenue growth when you \u2013 obviously, the year-over-year 10% number has the noise in there from closing on the TracFone acquisition November last year. But I mentioned, even if you ignore all of the Trac revenues, up more than 3% year-over-year. So we\u2019re building the right momentum there. Obviously, we will have significantly more customers on FWA that we will be billing next year than we did this year. Hans mentioned the positive momentum around 5G private networks and MEC. So we will get \u201823 plan locked down here, and then we will be in a position to talk about longer-term where we see things as well, but certainly continuing to build on the momentum that we\u2019ve seen in the last quarter.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks a lot.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. First, a follow-up, please, on John\u2019s question. You\u2019re still losing accounts in Consumer despite pushing pretty hard this quarter. What did you see an impact from the introduction Unlimited plan? And how did that contribute to your gross adds improvement this quarter? And then second, can you give us any idea of what\u2019s going on in Business? You\u2019re seeing really strong adds. AT&T as well and T-Mobile is saying the same thing. Is this second lines being bought by businesses for their employees? What type of usage do you see in those lines? Just give us an idea of what\u2019s going on in the industry? Thanks very much.\nHans Vestberg: I can start on the Business side. We have seen strong business growth on the wireless side for five consecutive quarters. So clearly, what we see is that both from the government, from large enterprises, small and medium businesses, they rely on the \u2013 on high-performing networks is extremely important, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re giving them. And that\u2019s why we are growing. I mean we have had a really good run on it, and the team is doing a great job. I mean this quarter was 197,000 net \u2013 phone net adds in the Business segment. And as Matt said, it\u2019s across over all the three segments: government, enterprise and small and medium businesses. So clearly, we have a good transformation there with our customers. And of course, adding to that, we have a great sales force out there every day with all these accounts because it\u2019s about the network, and it\u2019s about the go to market. And we are the strongest in both, so we feel really good about that.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. And just building on that maybe a little bit...\nPhil Cusick: I\u2019m sorry, Hans, if I can just...\nMatt Ellis: Go ahead. Go ahead, Phil.\nPhil Cusick: I just wanted to follow up on Hans, the question was more what are people using this for, right? So industry penetration is very high. Everybody is looking at around trying to figure out where we\u2019re going. Are these \u2013 do you think these are second lines being bought for maybe sort of high security measures? What\u2019s the usage look on the growing lines in Business versus maybe the new lines in Consumer? We\u2019re just trying to get an idea of what\u2019s driving this strength. And it\u2019s not just you, it\u2019s across the board.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. No, it\u2019s the same \u2013 it\u2019s normal. We see more, of course, as any company will go in more mobile. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re seeing secondary lines or something like that. And remember, we \u2013 if it\u2019s sort of an IoT line, etcetera, that\u2019s outside this. We\u2019re talking about phone net adds here. So this is normal lines that is coming into our customers for normal usage. We haven\u2019t seen any difference in that compared to previous quarter that is something strange there. No, it\u2019s actually normal lines coming in that customers are transforming more to mobility.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. And Phil, just maybe building on that a little bit. Certainly, the continued strong employment position feeds into this. That\u2019s very much the positive. But look, I think the other thing as you think about Business to think about is the depth of the relationships we have with Business customers over many years from both wireless and our legacy wireline relationships and the quality of the network continues to matter to our Business customers and our team have been very effective at selling into those customers. But if you are \u2013 if the suggestion from anything that you have been hearing is these are secondary lines with low usage on it, that couldn\u2019t be more further from the truth. These are absolutely primary lines. We see it in the usage. Certainly, as businesses continue more and more people in mobile, and we see that. But these are absolutely primary use lines, and we know that from the usage we see on that. In terms of on the consumer side, on accounts, certainly, that trend is something that continued into 3Q. And \u2013 but you also saw the positive momentum from a gross add standpoint, and that feeds through into the account trend also moving in a better line than it was. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect 4Q to have positive phone net adds and that should show up in the trend on the accounts side as well. So, look, overall gross adds are up 5%, and they were up on a year-over-year base in consumer. So, there is a lot of good things going on. And then within our base, we just have to keep reminding people of the value. The team is doing an outstanding job there, and they have got more to bring to the market here as we go forward.\nPhil Cusick: Any idea of what the contribution from Welcome Unlimited was Matt? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. It\u2019s mix. You have got to think about the contribution from Welcome in two ways. One, obviously, in terms of the number of adds that people signed up for, but more importantly, the number of additional visits to the stores that it drove. Because certainly, some people who came in to Welcome, but it also gave us the opportunity to talk to more customers coming into the stores about all of our plans. So, we would have a good number of customers that came in because they seem to Welcome pricing, but then actually purchased one of our Mix & Match price plans as well. So, we don\u2019t really have a specific breakout there for you, but definitely a contributor to the increase in store traffic and the increase in gross adds.\nPhil Cusick: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Phil. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open sir.\nDavid Barden: Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess two, if I could. I would like to ask a corollary to Phil\u2019s question there, which is \u2013 obviously, we had like negative 11% gross adds last quarter, positive 1% in consumer this quarter. Where are those gross adds coming from? I think you highlighted that you felt there was a hole in the portfolio with respect to BYOD. I would suggest that the BYOD concentrated players, maybe the cable players, are maybe ones that are giving you market share or maybe you have seen something else in the porting ratios that have changed the game. I would be interested in where you think this SoGA shift is coming from? And then the second piece, Matt, your exposure on the balance sheet to variable rates, rising rates is not because you have floating rate debt per se but because you took actions in terms of swaps and hedges to create that variable rate exposure. Theoretically, you could buy your way out of that if you felt that was an economic way to go. Arguably, you could maybe take those losses through to your adjusted EPS, and then it could affect your earnings per share trajectory. Is there any part of you that thinks that there is an economic opportunity that might present itself to reverse gear in some of that variable rate exposure? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. A couple of things, what drove the gross adds. I mean first of all, I think as Matt said, the Welcome plan drove \u2013 because that was a segment we were softer in the first quarter and the second quarter, and that\u2019s why we addressed it. And that was probably the quickest turnaround we have done ever to bring out a new plan dedicated and nationwide. And that should be a reflection of how we plan to work. I mean we will be very agile. We will quickly move into segments where we see softness in our consumer base. And I am happy with what I have seen so far. But also the marketing work because if you think about the growth we had both in gross adds, but also, as Matt said, when it comes to store visits, that was up more than double digit in the quarter compared to second quarter. So, all that together work, and that\u2019s what we need to continue to work and see if there are other weaknesses in the consumer portfolio. Remember, now we are going all the way from the premium down to the lowest and most cost-efficient plans on our prepaid. And the work we are doing, we have integrated that in our consumer group right now. And we look into that we are doing the right things for every segment and see that we have the right offerings for our customers. That might be that we are aggressive in certain segments and not in others. And that\u2019s sort of where we come with our size right now, we can do that. And I was happy with seeing what happened in the second quarter \u2013 or in the third quarter with some of the actions we have taken. But we are not finished yet. We need to do more of this. We need to be more surgical. We need to attack the areas where we see weakness. But that was what\u2019s growing the gross adds in the quarter, clearly.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Hi. On the question around interest rates, so we have absolutely had a targeted rate of effective variable to fix, and that served us very well, continues to serve us very well over the course of the economic cycle. And we think that creates value over the course of the cycle for the company, and obviously, shareholders as well. As you mentioned, Dave, obviously, this year has seen significant increase there. And so some of those hedges have obviously moved around in value. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the work the treasury team has done, not just this year, but over many years now to not just manage the overall debt profile, but also the interest rate expense. You see that in the income statement over the past few years, where even as our debt has gone up to pay for the C-Band acquisition and so on, our total interest expense cost has actually remained relatively flat. So, we will continue to manage the balance sheet there. And as you mentioned, if there is opportunities to create incremental value, I think our track record would tell you very strongly that you should expect us to be doing everything taking full advantage of those.\nDavid Barden: Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you and good morning. When you look across the strategic products, postpaid phones for consumer and business and Fios broadband, what\u2019s the risk that customers trade-down in rate plan tiers if the U.S. goes into recession? And then pivoting over to the value segment, has Verizon begun to migrate any prepaid customers to the postpaid base? And can you size the future opportunity and timing for this possible migration? And then just one more, if I could, on prepaid. Is there an update on the size and timing of savings, especially for roaming when you think about the TracFone integration?\nHans Vestberg: Okay. Let me start with the first one. As we said earlier, man, the Welcome plan worked very well for us, and we didn\u2019t see many of our customers trading down. And actually, it was more about softness in the marketplace there, and that\u2019s where we actually gained success. And then \u2013 but on the other hand, we saw many of our customers coming into the store. And then we \u2013 after a conversation, of course, we saw them actually doing a step-up and then going for another plan. So, it actually worked. We didn\u2019t see that step-downs we see in the market has happened so far, where I think we are segmenting it up with the values we have in each and every segment. So \u2013 but if they would do it over time, given the economic situation, we will be better prepared than anybody else. And when we are actually addressing all the segments of the market, so we can work with that. When it comes to the prepaid \u2013 to the postpaid migration, that is, of course, one of the pillars in our strategy to see that our customers can do that and part of our acquisition strategy to see that we can offer the customers. That will take some IT work. And as I said before, that will technically, meaning that you cannot eat more easily work in between prepaid and postpaid. That will take some time before it\u2019s finished. But already today, of course, we have a collaboration in between our groups as this sort of under one roof, the whole value and premium segments. So, I think that\u2019s what we are going to do. But that\u2019s, of course, an opportunity for us over time to have more of that. But already right now, we are seeing good sign on our value segment as we start growing in the third quarter. And we just added new products, including Total Wireless, which is a higher end of the value market as well as adding now fixed wireless access to the \u2013 to some of the brands. So, there is much more to do. And we are encouraged what we have seen so far about the potential, and that was the reason we acquired TracFone, because we saw this potential to play in all the Consumer segment and adding products in different ways and scaling sort of our platforms. The more we can scale the platforms, the network and the products, the more efficient we are going to be on the return on capital invested.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. A couple of follow-ups there, Mike. So, the risk of trading down, we have obviously seen a number of different economic cycles during the life of the wireless business. And we don\u2019t historically see significant amounts of trade-down during a macro downturn. So, I don\u2019t expect anything different, again, because the value that people place on their connectivity products, whether that\u2019s broadband or wireless, is higher than ever. So, we will obviously monitor it closely, but history would suggest the risk of that is not that high. And then your last question around integration on roaming, we should largely have the roaming integration, all of the customers, over onto the Verizon network during 2023. We haven\u2019t quantified the benefit there, but obviously significant. But that will be \u2013 that should be in the financials by the end of next year.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks very much.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Mike. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open sir.\nTim Horan: Thank you. So, C-Band build-outs going faster and it sounds like better than expected. So, Matt, can you talk about when you think you will largely be done with that spending and maybe just the ultimate \u2013 thinking on the ultimate POPs covered and capacity that you are adding? Any color there would be great?\nHans Vestberg: Yes. I can start and Matt will come in there as well. But when it comes to the C-Band spending, you remember, we said we are going to do an additional $10 billion on CapEx. The year has not ended, but you have seen more or less where we are guiding. So, it\u2019s going to be some portion left for the next year on CapEx, but that\u2019s a smaller part. And then it\u2019s going to be BAU because then we have done all our initial. What has happened after that is, of course, we are getting a much more spectrum to the sites and we get some more markets. But then we are down to BAU as we have always been building capacity and network on 4G, 3G. Now, we will do it on 5G with the spectrum we have. So, feel good about that situation and how we have been doing it. And this was part of the strategy we laid out for the network already 2017 in order to draw the benefit of a unified network with a strong sort of edge capability with different type of access technologies. And now, of course, with C-Band, we are adding that strength. So, we are going to pass the 200 million POPs in the first quarter 2023, and then we will just continue to deploy as we are getting more spectrum. I mean still today, we are using mainly 60 megahertz. There are some places where we have started to trial out 100 megahertz. But as you know, we have 161 megahertz nationwide. And in some places, we are 200 megahertz. So, we have so much more spectrum and capacity. But the guys have been building smart. So, when the spectrum comes, we turn it up. It\u2019s not going out to the site again. So, we are ready for that.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So, Tim, just on the \u2013 exactly what Hans said on the timing. If you think about it, we are still spending on the LTE network today, and that\u2019s obviously 10-plus years from when we launched. So, that\u2019s because the usage on the network continues to grow, the utility people get from it continues to grow. And that\u2019s why you see our customer base expanding as a result. But as you think about connecting the dots here, as we said, we will be close to 200 million \u2013 well, we will cross 200 million POPs in the first quarter of next year. The $10 billion will largely be spent \u2013 we said there would be a stub left over to next year, so that kind of overlaps there. So, think about it from the standpoint, the $10 billion took care of covering the first roughly 200 million POPs. Then the rest of it goes into BAU. And you create space in BAU because those 200 million POPs have now got C-Band coverage. We said over half of our base has a 5G compatible device in their hands. And so the usage growth in those areas is going on C-Band. That means we don\u2019t have to continue spending on LTE in those markets. And then combined with other programs that are coming to an end on the peak spend, such as OneFiber, Intelligent Edge Network, that\u2019s the space for the C-Band continued build, both from a coverage and a capacity standpoint, to be in the BAU-level spend, just like as we continue to expand the LTE network for many years. It was part of the BAU-level spend. So, absolutely peak level this year. CapEx comes down next year. And then I would expect even further in \u201824 as the $10 billion is completely gone, as we spoke about earlier this year. And that obviously has a positive impact on free cash flow and the decisions we will be able to have in front of us as a result of that going forward. So, couldn\u2019t be happier with the pace at which the team has built it out and spent that money, unbelievable work the team has done there. And it puts us in a great place to reduce CapEx going forward.\nTim Horan: So, any updates on the ultimate amount of coverage that you will have or POPs covered and rough timing on that?\nMatt Ellis: I think Kyle has said pretty clearly that you should expect \u2013 where you get 4G today, you should be expecting to get 5G in the future as we continue to build out.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Our C-Band spectrum is nationwide, every market, every state. So, we are just going to complete that and see that we have a similar as the 4G network, as Matt says.\nTim Horan: Good. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Tim. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. Hans, I wonder if you could talk about convergence a little bit, particularly on the consumer side of your business. There is certainly a broad sense that the industry is moving towards converged offerings of wireless and home Internet. How do you think about that? And how do you think about it differently in areas where you have Fios and where you have fixed wireless broadband? Is that, in some ways, what\u2019s driving the fixed wireless broadband deployment, or do you see them as still somewhat two separate services that are trying to fill two separate needs?\nHans Vestberg: Hey Craig. I think first of all, we have seen some early steps of convergence in a market where mobility and home is going together. Of course, ultimately, the customers will define is that the best model. I think we are in a great position for obvious reasons, where we deploy our fixed \u2013 remember, when we deploy our network on the C-Band, we start in urban and suburban. And that\u2019s of course, also where the fixed wireless access opportunity arises. So, then the combination of fixed and home and mobile is emerging there. So, we are going to play on that. And you have seen we have offerings on that in the market and also working with our Fios footprint equally much. We have the optionality. And the customers will decide if that is a good way forward. I think we are in a very strong position. We have owners\u2019 economics on all our home broadband and all our mobility and being able to see that we can follow the market. And it goes back a little bit to what I have said before. We need to be agile and be surgical in different segments. If we see that, for example, convergence is happening in certain segments, we quickly come out with offerings and do that. And that\u2019s what the team is working with constantly right now. And if that is a trend going there and it\u2019s just accentuated, we are going to be super well positioned for that. If it\u2019s not, we are also super positioned for keeping it separate. We are going to see that the market. We are going to drive the market. We think it\u2019s strength for us that we have owners\u2019 economics on both mobility and broadband. So, we will drive it where we see a good traction on it. And as you have seen already, we have already offerings out there, and we will continue to do so.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks Craig. Operator or Brad, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. What are the largest factors impacting your churn in your base right now? And kind of after we get through this bump from the pricing action, what do you need to address to get the churn back down? And how soon can we see those tactics begin to work?\nHans Vestberg: I think when it comes to the consumer churn, as Matt explained, the vast majority in the third quarter was coming from the price adjustments we did, which was a deliberate decision we took in the second quarter, and it was as expected. That was the larger piece of it in the churn. And as Matt said before, our job right now is to continue to drive this downwards and see that, that is evaporating out there. We have some leakage into the \u2013 into October from it because \u2013 given how the price adjustments come out in the market.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Just, Frank, to build on that a little bit. So, absolutely, we expected to see that increase, but it was certainly a good a good trade for us because it drove the gross add increase that we spoke about earlier, also drove a 2% sequential increase in service revenue and 3% in EBITDA. So, we will work through the bubble from that as we go forward. But obviously, the actions produce the type of results that we wanted. We will expect to get back to more normal levels going forward. We constantly have to communicate to our base of customers the value of being on the Verizon network, and that\u2019s something that we have got many years of doing. As we have just spoke about a couple of questions ago, the quality of that network with the C-Band build-out is expanding rapidly. And we have the opportunity to continue to demonstrate to customers the premium service they get on Verizon. And as we do that, I am very confident that churn will get back to the levels we would expect it to be. And combined with the improved gross add performance, we will see that show up in the financials, and more importantly, in strong cash flow from the business. So, really happy with the sequential trajectory we have. We need to keep building on that as we go forward here. That\u2019s what the team is focused on.\nFrank Louthan: Alright. Great. Thank you very much.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thanks Frank. Brad, that\u2019s all the time we have today.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Last quarter, we told you we would take actions. Today, I am here to share the results those actions have delivered. We ended the third quarter with wireless service revenue growth up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially and adjusted EBITDA grew sequentially by almost 3% to $12.2 billion. We had total phone gross adds of nearly 2.6 million and about 5% year-over-year increase. This includes an increase in consumer of 1.3%, a significant improvement from minus 11% in the second quarter. These results are early indicators that the actions we are taking across our businesses to build momentum are gaining traction. Of course, we are not done yet. I continue to work with my team to take actions to grow revenue and to take cost out of our business to unlock the full potential of Verizon. I am glad to see sequential improvements based on our efforts, but there is more to do. Based on our momentum and plans, our financial guidance for 2022 remains unchanged. Throughout the call, you will hear the actions we took and the impact they have had on our business to position Verizon for growth. Our pricing actions in the second quarter in both our consumer and business groups helped increase our wireless service revenue. Postpaid phone net adds came in 8,000 for the quarter, with a loss from consumer offset by gains in Verizon Business. Matt will share more details with you later in the call. Let me turn to some of our group results. In Consumer, we have started to gain traction with customers reacting positively to our new offerings and as a result, increased store traffic. Our Welcome plan improved customers' pricing perception and contributed to consumer phone gross adds being up year-over-year. With the launch of the iPhone 14, we delivered a first-of-its-kind Apple 1 Unlimited bundle. Verizon customers now have access to Apple services all under one subscription. Apple remains a unique and trusted partner of Verizon, because they recognize our network quality and high-value customers. In the value segment, we launched Total By Verizon, redefining no contract wireless service, a key step in our continued integration of TracFone. And just this week, we introduced a prepaid wireless home Internet service on our Straight Talk brand. We continue to expand our offerings in the value segment and customers are taking notice. This helped also generate positive prepaid net adds for the quarter, our first positive quarter since second quarter 2021. For postpaid, we are focused on attracting and retaining high-quality consumers in a disciplined and measured approach. As we see areas of opportunity, we will address them in a surgical manner just like we have done with some of our recent actions. There is more progress to make. Our premium strategy is working. We ended the third quarter with 53% of our customers having a 5G phone and 81% of our base is on Unlimited plans. With a 42% uptake on Premium Unlimited, there is a great opportunity for step-ups. And we see that demand with approximately 60% of our new customers choosing Premium Unlimited right from the start. It is clear we have a high-quality customer base, so we will continue to focus on retention and winning these customers. Moving to Verizon Business, we see a continued very good momentum in both fixed wireless access and mobility. And I am encouraged also by the large 5G infrastructure deals we made in the quarter. These include digital transformation projects with Astellas Pharmaceuticals, Fujifilm and our continued work with the Department of Defense. And this is just a start. We recently announced an important agreement with the U.S. Department of State to modernize its communications infrastructure across embassies and other locations around the world. I am proud that we are partner of choice for these global enterprises and public sector clients. In broadband, our fixed wireless access and fire service continued to see strong demand. Total broadband net adds were 377,000, a sequential growth of over 40%. All of these services are built to deliver on top of our world-class network. We have a premium network and experience that our customers value and that demands premium pricing. Our network is a core value proposition. America relies on us and we deliver. This was evident before, during and in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. Our team did what we always do. We ran to the crisis, quickly restoring our network as needed and using our technology solution to protect impacted areas. Bottom line, our network infrastructure was resilient and our people delivered in the way that you have come to expect from us. Our mission has always been to build and operate the best, most reliable, highest performing network. Our use of advanced technologies, our spectrum portfolio and our expansive own fiber footprint, are critical to achieving that goal. Where we deploy our C-band, we see direct correlation to customer growth on both mobility and fixed wireless access. We are currently covering over 160 million POPs with C-band and on track to deliver 200 million within the first quarter of 2023. C-band usage is up 170% quarter-over-quarter and fixed wireless access now covers more than 40 million households. Right now, more than 48% of our cell sites are connected by Verizon's own fiber. We are expecting to be about 50% by year-end with the majority of our 5G sites already on our own fiber. This not only improves network performance, but also improves our owners' economics. At the same time, we are making efforts to take cost out of our business. We are constantly thinking about how we run our enterprise everyday to enhance our performance while delivering on our strategy. In this period, we have designed a company-wide cost savings program that we expect will save between $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2025. A first step in these efforts is the creation of a global service organization under the leadership of Craig Silliman. This is one part of our larger program to leverage cross-functional opportunities across the business. Over the past 2 years, under unprecedented circumstances, we have learned a lot about how we deliver our services to customers. Verizon global services will help unlock significant efficiencies and reduce cost across the business. Keeping in line with our company values and strategy, we continue to practice financial discipline even in a competitive market and delivered solid financial performance quarter-over-quarter. Verizon is in a strong position, no matter economical environment with our high-quality customer base, diversified go-to-market options, including our value offering, that benefits from strengthening our organization through our cost savings program and the best network that just keeps getting better. I will now hand it over to Matt to go deeper into our results. Thank you, Matt. The actions we have taken are showing progress, but there is more work to be done. Our priorities through the end of the year and into 2023 are straightforward: continue our traction in Consumer wireless through the holiday season and into 2023; maintain and grow our momentum in fixed wireless access and Business wireless; implement the initial framework of a cross-functional efficiency program and improve our working capital efficiencies; and finally, continue our measured and strategic approach to the market with financial discipline and increased momentum for the quarters to come. While there is work to be done, I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver. So thank you. Now we're ready for your questions. Brady, back to you. Thank you, John. I can start and Matt will fill in. I mean when it comes to the quarter and the gross adds and the churn, I think what happened is that we came out from the second quarter where the soft quarter on the Consumer side when it comes to gross adds. We added a couple of new products all the way from the Welcome plan to the price adjustments. And of course, the outcome we were expecting was that we continue to grow both ARPA, but also our wireless service revenue. And as you heard, we grew the service revenue with 3.5% if we exclude TracFone, but then with TracFone. So that clearly is working for us, and we will continue to do that. But we will do it in certain segments where we see weakness. I mean we also saw a very strong continuation in our premium segments, where we continue to have now more than 81% of consumers on unlimited and 42% on Unlimited Premium. So we \u2013 that area is going well. So we just need to find those areas, and we will continue to do that. But I think that we have a very competitive pricing in the market. We add that with values like the one plan with Apple right now at Apple One Unlimited, et cetera, and we have more to come. So it's \u2013 for us it's a grind it to see that we do the right in the segment. And of course, we have the largest consumer base in the market. So we just need to see that we're doing this in the right way. And ultimately, our goal is to continue to grow our EBITDA. And you saw this quarter, we grew our EBITDA ;with almost 3%. And that's what we're doing, and we keep our guidance for the full year. So we \u2013 that's our job. And then on top of that, we take out costs. So I think all in all, that's what we're working with constantly here. And it's a big ship we're moving. I think that this quarter, we saw all the actions we took in the second quarter having impact \u2013 positive impact. That doesn't mean we're done. We think we can do more and we have more to do. So that's sort of the summary of where I think we are and how we're executing, and we will continue to execute in this quarter and the quarters to come. Yes. Thank you, Brett. When it comes to our national broadband strategy, first of all, I think it's working really good for us. You saw in the quarter adding 377,000. The Fios footprint continue to be extremely high-quality customers and continue to grow. We will continue to expand that footprint. Outside that, we, of course, have a very high focus on fixed wireless access because the speed to market, because the demand in the market right now is high for broadband. And of course, we have a very disruptive model where it takes low single digits minutes to actually get broadband at home. It's a total different product when it comes to fixed wireless access. So we capture the market as soon as we can right now, and you see on our growth rates that is happening both for Consumer as for Business. But as you rightfully said, we are deploying the network as we speak, and we are just into certain markets given on the C-band, we will have more and more markets. And as we stated in the remarks, I mean, we are now covering 40 million households with our fixed wireless access. So we will continue to expand that, and we have plans and execution. It's working well. The quality is improving. The customer satisfaction is really high on fixed wireless access and of course, there are the competition in these areas are of course not equally good customer satisfaction. So no, I think \u2013 we think \u2013 we are confident that this is a good strategy for us. Then when it comes to our fiber, you're absolutely right. We have done enormous investment in fiber. We want owners' economics on our network, and we are getting that because with the majority of all the 5G sites have our own fiber, and we're now passing 50% by year-end on all our sites. Some sites will never need fiber. So it's not like 100% is the end goal. But in order to have a good experience for our customers, that's what we're doing. Then we want to see opportunities, especially for the Business side to use that fiber footprint outside. I'd like to see that some customers can get a better or we can substitute third-party fiber that we are getting from others. But clearly, focus on fiber in the Fios footprint, fixed wireless access going as fast as we can outside that. So yes, we are confident about the strategy, and it's working. We have talked about for several years. We come out with new products, that's going to be multi-spectrum. That's going to handle everything from 4G, C-band, 10-millimeter wave. So the resilience and the performance and quality of the products is even getting better. So yes, that's where we are. Yes. I can start on the enterprise side with the mobile edge compute, which we \u2013 and the private 5G networks. As I said a couple of times before \u2013 right now, we had three different sort of use cases on the edge computing: one was private networks, another was public mobile edge compute, and the third was the private 5G mobile edge compute. We see clearly a very strong demand on the private 5G networks, which is the prelude to go into all others, and the funnel is strong. And we talked about a couple of examples this quarter which we have gained. And it's a normal typical enterprise or B2B cycle, where you start with one proof of concept, then you start deploying it, and then you roll it out. So that's going to continue to happen over the years is, of course, not going to be any significant revenues in the short-term. But over time, we're building a totally new opportunity for Sapa and his team to be with customers in larger sort of turnkey projects to reform and transform their digital asset for enterprises. So we are still really confident this is a good strategy for us. And it's \u2013 again, we're building on the same network. We built a network once, and we have several different use cases where the mobility and now the fixed wireless access both are going in a high speed. And now we're adding the mobile edge compute that's starting to get off to a good start, especially with private 5G networks, and then we move into mobile edge compute. So that's how I see that market continue for us. I can start on the Business side. We have seen strong business growth on the wireless side for five consecutive quarters. So clearly, what we see is that both from the government, from large enterprises, small and medium businesses, they rely on the \u2013 on high-performing networks is extremely important, and that's what we're giving them. And that's why we are growing. I mean we have had a really good run on it, and the team is doing a great job. I mean this quarter was 197,000 net \u2013 phone net adds in the Business segment. And as Matt said, it's across over all the three segments: government, enterprise and small and medium businesses. So clearly, we have a good transformation there with our customers. And of course, adding to that, we have a great sales force out there every day with all these accounts because it's about the network, and it's about the go to market. And we are the strongest in both, so we feel really good about that. Okay. No, it's the same \u2013 it's normal. We see more, of course, as any company will go in more mobile. It's not like we're seeing secondary lines or something like that. And remember, we \u2013 if it's sort of an IoT line, etcetera, that's outside this. We're talking about phone net adds here. So this is normal lines that is coming into our customers for normal usage. We haven't seen any difference in that compared to previous quarter that is something strange there. No, it's actually normal lines coming in that customers are transforming more to mobility. Thank you. A couple of things, what drove the gross adds. I mean first of all, I think as Matt said, the Welcome plan drove \u2013 because that was a segment we were softer in the first quarter and the second quarter, and that's why we addressed it. And that was probably the quickest turnaround we have done ever to bring out a new plan dedicated and nationwide. And that should be a reflection of how we plan to work. I mean we will be very agile. We will quickly move into segments where we see softness in our consumer base. And I am happy with what I have seen so far. But also the marketing work because if you think about the growth we had both in gross adds, but also, as Matt said, when it comes to store visits, that was up more than double digit in the quarter compared to second quarter. So, all that together work, and that's what we need to continue to work and see if there are other weaknesses in the consumer portfolio. Remember, now we are going all the way from the premium down to the lowest and most cost-efficient plans on our prepaid. And the work we are doing, we have integrated that in our consumer group right now. And we look into that we are doing the right things for every segment and see that we have the right offerings for our customers. That might be that we are aggressive in certain segments and not in others. And that's sort of where we come with our size right now, we can do that. And I was happy with seeing what happened in the second quarter \u2013 or in the third quarter with some of the actions we have taken. But we are not finished yet. We need to do more of this. We need to be more surgical. We need to attack the areas where we see weakness. But that was what's growing the gross adds in the quarter, clearly. Okay. Let me start with the first one. As we said earlier, man, the Welcome plan worked very well for us, and we didn't see many of our customers trading down. And actually, it was more about softness in the marketplace there, and that's where we actually gained success. And then \u2013 but on the other hand, we saw many of our customers coming into the store. And then we \u2013 after a conversation, of course, we saw them actually doing a step-up and then going for another plan. So, it actually worked. We didn't see that step-downs we see in the market has happened so far, where I think we are segmenting it up with the values we have in each and every segment. So \u2013 but if they would do it over time, given the economic situation, we will be better prepared than anybody else. And when we are actually addressing all the segments of the market, so we can work with that. When it comes to the prepaid \u2013 to the postpaid migration, that is, of course, one of the pillars in our strategy to see that our customers can do that and part of our acquisition strategy to see that we can offer the customers. That will take some IT work. And as I said before, that will technically, meaning that you cannot eat more easily work in between prepaid and postpaid. That will take some time before it's finished. But already today, of course, we have a collaboration in between our groups as this sort of under one roof, the whole value and premium segments. So, I think that's what we are going to do. But that's, of course, an opportunity for us over time to have more of that. But already right now, we are seeing good sign on our value segment as we start growing in the third quarter. And we just added new products, including Total Wireless, which is a higher end of the value market as well as adding now fixed wireless access to the \u2013 to some of the brands. So, there is much more to do. And we are encouraged what we have seen so far about the potential, and that was the reason we acquired TracFone, because we saw this potential to play in all the Consumer segment and adding products in different ways and scaling sort of our platforms. The more we can scale the platforms, the network and the products, the more efficient we are going to be on the return on capital invested. Yes. I can start and Matt will come in there as well. But when it comes to the C-Band spending, you remember, we said we are going to do an additional $10 billion on CapEx. The year has not ended, but you have seen more or less where we are guiding. So, it's going to be some portion left for the next year on CapEx, but that's a smaller part. And then it's going to be BAU because then we have done all our initial. What has happened after that is, of course, we are getting a much more spectrum to the sites and we get some more markets. But then we are down to BAU as we have always been building capacity and network on 4G, 3G. Now, we will do it on 5G with the spectrum we have. So, feel good about that situation and how we have been doing it. And this was part of the strategy we laid out for the network already 2017 in order to draw the benefit of a unified network with a strong sort of edge capability with different type of access technologies. And now, of course, with C-Band, we are adding that strength. So, we are going to pass the 200 million POPs in the first quarter 2023, and then we will just continue to deploy as we are getting more spectrum. I mean still today, we are using mainly 60 megahertz. There are some places where we have started to trial out 100 megahertz. But as you know, we have 161 megahertz nationwide. And in some places, we are 200 megahertz. So, we have so much more spectrum and capacity. But the guys have been building smart. So, when the spectrum comes, we turn it up. It's not going out to the site again. So, we are ready for that. Yes. Our C-Band spectrum is nationwide, every market, every state. So, we are just going to complete that and see that we have a similar as the 4G network, as Matt says. Hey Craig. I think first of all, we have seen some early steps of convergence in a market where mobility and home is going together. Of course, ultimately, the customers will define is that the best model. I think we are in a great position for obvious reasons, where we deploy our fixed \u2013 remember, when we deploy our network on the C-Band, we start in urban and suburban. And that's of course, also where the fixed wireless access opportunity arises. So, then the combination of fixed and home and mobile is emerging there. So, we are going to play on that. And you have seen we have offerings on that in the market and also working with our Fios footprint equally much. We have the optionality. And the customers will decide if that is a good way forward. I think we are in a very strong position. We have owners' economics on all our home broadband and all our mobility and being able to see that we can follow the market. And it goes back a little bit to what I have said before. We need to be agile and be surgical in different segments. If we see that, for example, convergence is happening in certain segments, we quickly come out with offerings and do that. And that's what the team is working with constantly right now. And if that is a trend going there and it's just accentuated, we are going to be super well positioned for that. If it's not, we are also super positioned for keeping it separate. We are going to see that the market. We are going to drive the market. We think it's strength for us that we have owners' economics on both mobility and broadband. So, we will drive it where we see a good traction on it. And as you have seen already, we have already offerings out there, and we will continue to do so. Thanks Craig. Operator or Brad, we have time for one last question. I think when it comes to the consumer churn, as Matt explained, the vast majority in the third quarter was coming from the price adjustments we did, which was a deliberate decision we took in the second quarter, and it was as expected. That was the larger piece of it in the churn. And as Matt said before, our job right now is to continue to drive this downwards and see that, that is evaporating out there. We have some leakage into the \u2013 into October from it because \u2013 given how the price adjustments come out in the market. Yes. Thanks Frank. Brad, that's all the time we have today."

            "name": "Matt Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans and good morning everyone. Our results from the third quarter were not yet where we would like them to be. But as you heard from Hans, the actions we have taken in the past two quarters are gaining traction in the marketplace. As a result, we saw positive developments in store traffic and consumer phone gross adds further gains in broadband and a sequential improvement in our financial results. We anticipate that we will be able to build on this momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Let's now walk through results from the third quarter, beginning with an overview of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our strategy for mobility growth is to drive revenue growth by attracting and retaining high-quality customers and migrating them into premium tiers. Premium penetration in the consumer segment increased to approximately 42% at quarter end, a sequential increase in line with prior quarters even with the introduction of the Welcome plan and the current economic backdrop. As a result of the continued increase in Premium plan penetration, combined with the benefit from our admin fee increase and the impact from metered price-ups, consumer postpaid ARPA increased 3.8% year-over-year. Overall, phone gross adds were up approximately 5% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in business as well as the improvement in consumer gross adds. With the impact of 3Q churn, which increased as expected as a result of our recent pricing actions, phone net adds were 8,000 for the quarter. Business delivered 197,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter, their fifth consecutive quarter exceeding 150,000. The results were again balanced across the three customer groups, with enterprise delivering their best-ever phone net add performance and SMB and public sector both seeing double-digit phone gross add growth. On the Consumer side, postpaid phone gross adds were up 1.3% year-over-year, a notable sequential improvement from an 11% decline in Q2. The launch of the Welcome plan and the Apple One Unlimited plan helped to generate more store traffic while providing another avenue to compete outside of promotional spend. We have now seen year-over-year improvement in phone gross add performance for four consecutive months through September and anticipate another low single-digit year-over-year growth performance in the fourth quarter. As expected, the pricing actions we took around administrative fees and metered plans led to an increase in disconnects. With certain price-ups being phased in throughout the third quarter, we would anticipate some disconnect pressure to carryover into Q4. Taken together, we currently expect the gross add and disconnect performance to result in positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter. Let's now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. Total broadband net adds were 377,000 in the quarter, reflecting a strong demand for reliable and high-value broadband offerings. Fixed wireless access momentum continued throughout the third quarter. We added 342,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in 2Q, reflecting increased demand across business and consumers. More than 75% of our consumer net adds are coming from urban and suburban locations with data usage that continues to mirror our Fios customers. We anticipate further share gains in this space as we continue to expand our household coverage and begin to realize benefits from our offering in the prepaid segment. We also added 61,000 Fios Internet net adds during the third quarter, reflecting improved gross outperformance from Q2 as well as continued strong retention levels. Our ability to grow Fios in spite of some secular headwinds due to lower move activity shows that the quality, value and reliability that Fios offers, continues to resonate strongly with customers. We further expanded our nationwide broadband opportunity by adding more fixed wireless households and businesses covered as well as growing our Fios open-for-sale within our ILEC footprint. Total fixed wireless household coverage surpassed 40 million in the quarter, including over 30 million covered by 5G Ultra Wideband. Fios open for sale is now at 16.9 million, a year-to-date increase of 410,000 and we remain on track to hit our full year target of 550,000. Now, let's talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our work to integrate TracFone continues, highlighted by the launch of our new prepaid brand, Total By Verizon, late in the quarter as well as the launch of fixed wireless for our prepaid customers earlier this month. For the quarter, we delivered positive prepaid net adds of 39,000, which excludes a base adjustment of 102,000 primarily relating to a competitor's 3G network shutdown. We saw significant improvement in TracFone's performance, which had positive net adds for the first time since Q1 2021. With our current momentum, combined with the launch of our new brand and fixed wireless, we are excited about our positioning and ability to further grow in the value market, bringing more connectivity and benefits to customers in this space. Now, let's move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was up 4.0% year-over-year as wireless service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue more than offset wireline declines and the net impact of last year's M&A activity. As a reminder, the third quarter last year only had 2 months of Verizon Media activity before its divestiture. Total wireless service revenue growth was up 10.0% from the prior year primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, continued effectiveness of our Premium Unlimited strategy and business volumes. The core business is strong as wireless service revenue, excluding all TracFone activities, grew above 3%. Additionally, we saw a benefit from the pricing actions taken earlier in the year, which we previously said would generate roughly $1 billion across Q3 and Q4. These actions helped to generate a sequential increase of $494 million in wireless service and other revenue and an increase of $345 million of adjusted EBITDA as total adjusted EBITDA came in at $12.2 billion for the quarter. We continue to feel the pressures of higher device subsidies and promotional spending despite taking steps throughout Q3 to be disciplined, including the launch of the Welcome plan, which comes with our device subsidy. Inflationary pressures remain elevated both from a year-over-year and sequential point of view with the increase from Q2 primarily coming from higher electricity rates. Expectations for full year 2022 impacts of inflation remain consistent with comments during our Q2 earnings call. To further mitigate inflation impacts, we have started a new cost savings program that we expect will provide a reduction in annual cost of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2025. This program will be focused on several areas within the business, including digitalization efforts to enhance the customer experience and streamlining internal operations through automation and process enhancements. While part of this will benefit the bottom line, a portion of these savings will be reinvested into the business to help accelerate opportunities. As Brady noted, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.32. In addition to the impact from EBITDA, this reflects sequential pressures in interest expense due to rate increases and a reduction in other income associated with non-cash changes to pension and OPEB. Based on year-to-date interest rate increases and market expectations for additional Federal Reserve actions this year, we now estimate cash interest expense for 2022 to be about $400 million higher than our expectation coming into the year. We anticipate this pressure will continue into next year given the full year impact from interest rate increases, providing an EPS headwind in 2023. Likewise, the impact from non-cash pension cost due to higher interest rates and lower return on assets this year is expected to put additional pressure on below-the-line items for 2023. Now, let's take a look at our third quarter consumer financial results. Total consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.8% year-over-year driven by wireless service revenue growth of 11.0% as well as higher equipment revenue. Wireless service revenue increases were the result of the inclusion of TracFone, core wireless service revenue growth and the impact of the pricing actions. Total Fios revenue was up versus the same period a year ago by 0.3% as growth from our Internet base offset the revenue impact of a 9% year-over-year decline in video subscribers. Fios content costs have also dropped resulting in an improved margin profile that we expect will continue to benefit from further shifts away from video. Consumer EBITDA was $10.6 billion, up 0.7% compared to the same period last year. The pricing actions as well as the full inclusion of TracFone results more than offset the pressures from higher promotional activity and the impact of inflation. Next, let's take a closer look at the Business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment's wireless results remained strong in 3Q, though wireline service revenue declines continued due to ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 5.7% was up from 3.0% last quarter, aided by pricing actions as well as continued growth in our customer base. Wireline revenue declined by 6.7% versus prior year. Operating trends are consistent with prior quarters. Though in Q3, we saw a sequential increase in USF revenue due to higher rates. Business EBITDA was $1.8 billion for the quarter, down 6.7% from the prior year. In addition to pressure from wireline, we experienced higher growth related costs as wireless sales volumes were up by 15% from the prior year. Now let's move on to Slide 13 and the cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three quarters of 2022 totaled $28.2 billion compared with $31.2 billion in the prior year period as working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased inventory levels continue, as we expected. Capital spending for the first three quarters of the year totaled $15.8 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to last year. C-band spending was $4.5 billion for the first 9 months of the year. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $12.4 billion for the first three quarters of the year. We exited the quarter with $129.3 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement of $1.3 billion, resulting in a net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. As Hans mentioned earlier, our low unsecured bond maturities over the remainder of this year and next and strong operational cash flow generation puts our balance sheet in a strong position. Payment trends remain at or better than pre-COVID levels, and the quality of our postpaid base has never been better as evidenced by recent asset-backed securities prospectus filings. As we look at Q3 results, we delivered the sequential revenue and EBITDA growth that we had anticipated from the actions taken in 2Q. Our guidance for 2022 remains unchanged. We are building momentum and remain confident that our strategy will deliver strong cash flow growth into the future. It is this confidence, combined with the health of our balance sheet, that enabled us to recently increase our dividend for the 16th consecutive year. We recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders, and we intend to continue to put the Board in a position to approve annual increases. I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to questions. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Hans. And John, so maybe the second part of your question first around churn and is our pricing in the right place, I'd point you to the fact that our gross adds were up almost 5% on a year-over-year basis in 3Q. So obviously, our offerings continue to resonate with customers, obviously, built on having the best network, and consumers continue to see the value of that. So continue to believe that the gross add traffic will be there, and we will get our fair share. On the churn side, just to put it in perspective, the pricing actions we took across both the metered plans and the fees touch more than 75 million phone customers. And so the uptick in churn that we saw in the quarter was highly expected. We kind of mentioned that 90 days ago that we expected it to happen. But the financial benefits came through as well, which was exactly as we expected and was the right approach to take. So obviously, the impact of those changes will mitigate as we go forward here, and we will continue to make sure that our churn is where it needs to be to ensure the right results. In terms of the first part of your question, you're right, we will speak to you more specifically about 2023 on the next call. We're obviously in the middle of our planning cycle right now. But you should certainly expect us to build on the momentum that you saw us deliver in the third quarter. You saw that wireless service revenue up sequentially 2%. As Hans mentioned, EBITDA up sequentially about 3%, that gives us a good platform to build on here in 4Q and then as we head into \u201823. And then you mentioned below the line, there will be some pressures next year. I'm not going to quantify those now. But as you think about the specifics of those, some of those we've spoken to all of you about before. When we came out of the C-band auction, we said that we would expect depreciation to increase and capitalized interest to reduce as we've deployed C-band sites and put them on there and really having kind of significant year-over-year impacts in \u201823 and \u201824. So that's in line with what we've been talking about for a while. And then you layer on top of that, obviously, interest rates are higher, and we will have a full year impact of that next year. And that impacts both the interest expense line, but also other non-cash below-the-line items around pension and OPEB, where the imputed interest cost will be higher with the higher macro rates and then also starting the year with lower assets because of the performance this year. So we will obviously quantify those things. But as we think about \u201823, we had good momentum coming out of 3Q on a sequential basis, look to build on that in 4Q, continue to generate significant amounts of cash flow that puts us in a position to be successful going forward. Brad, I'll just add one thing. You mentioned fiber to the home. Of course, our Fios team had another good quarter here, 61,000 net adds despite a low-mover environment. So as Hans said, we're very focused on doing broadband through fixed wireless access, but our Fios business continues to perform very strongly and add customers to that network. And we continue to build more open for sale in our Fios footprint. And just as a point to note, 3Q was a milestone for Fios in terms of going over 7 million connections with \u2013 for that business. So it continues to perform very strongly. And then we supplement it with fixed wireless access around the rest of the country. Yes. Simon, so your first question around CapEx, obviously, we will be more specific on \u201823 guidance in January, but nothing has changed around our view of CapEx. So very much in line and that's because of the great work the team has done this year. I mean we said we'd be at 175 million POPs covered by the end of the year. As you heard Hans say earlier, already at more than 160 million through 3Q. Not only will we be ahead of the 175 million, but we will be at 200 million at some point during the first quarter, so phenomenal speed that the team has built the network there. That means a significant chunk of the $10 billion CapEx for C-band will have been covered between last year and this year. So it will just be a small stub piece of that left next year and then we will be at those BAU levels that we've spoken to all of you about numerous times. In terms of the longer term revenue growth, I mean, obviously, we will come back to that, but certainly encouraged by what we saw in the third quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, wireless service revenue growth when you \u2013 obviously, the year-over-year 10% number has the noise in there from closing on the TracFone acquisition November last year. But I mentioned, even if you ignore all of the Trac revenues, up more than 3% year-over-year. So we're building the right momentum there. Obviously, we will have significantly more customers on FWA that we will be billing next year than we did this year. Hans mentioned the positive momentum around 5G private networks and MEC. So we will get \u201823 plan locked down here, and then we will be in a position to talk about longer-term where we see things as well, but certainly continuing to build on the momentum that we've seen in the last quarter. Yes. And just building on that maybe a little bit... Go ahead. Go ahead, Phil. Yes. And Phil, just maybe building on that a little bit. Certainly, the continued strong employment position feeds into this. That's very much the positive. But look, I think the other thing as you think about Business to think about is the depth of the relationships we have with Business customers over many years from both wireless and our legacy wireline relationships and the quality of the network continues to matter to our Business customers and our team have been very effective at selling into those customers. But if you are \u2013 if the suggestion from anything that you have been hearing is these are secondary lines with low usage on it, that couldn't be more further from the truth. These are absolutely primary lines. We see it in the usage. Certainly, as businesses continue more and more people in mobile, and we see that. But these are absolutely primary use lines, and we know that from the usage we see on that. In terms of on the consumer side, on accounts, certainly, that trend is something that continued into 3Q. And \u2013 but you also saw the positive momentum from a gross add standpoint, and that feeds through into the account trend also moving in a better line than it was. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect 4Q to have positive phone net adds and that should show up in the trend on the accounts side as well. So, look, overall gross adds are up 5%, and they were up on a year-over-year base in consumer. So, there is a lot of good things going on. And then within our base, we just have to keep reminding people of the value. The team is doing an outstanding job there, and they have got more to bring to the market here as we go forward. Yes. It's mix. You have got to think about the contribution from Welcome in two ways. One, obviously, in terms of the number of adds that people signed up for, but more importantly, the number of additional visits to the stores that it drove. Because certainly, some people who came in to Welcome, but it also gave us the opportunity to talk to more customers coming into the stores about all of our plans. So, we would have a good number of customers that came in because they seem to Welcome pricing, but then actually purchased one of our Mix & Match price plans as well. So, we don't really have a specific breakout there for you, but definitely a contributor to the increase in store traffic and the increase in gross adds. Yes. Hi. On the question around interest rates, so we have absolutely had a targeted rate of effective variable to fix, and that served us very well, continues to serve us very well over the course of the economic cycle. And we think that creates value over the course of the cycle for the company, and obviously, shareholders as well. As you mentioned, Dave, obviously, this year has seen significant increase there. And so some of those hedges have obviously moved around in value. I couldn't be happier with the work the treasury team has done, not just this year, but over many years now to not just manage the overall debt profile, but also the interest rate expense. You see that in the income statement over the past few years, where even as our debt has gone up to pay for the C-Band acquisition and so on, our total interest expense cost has actually remained relatively flat. So, we will continue to manage the balance sheet there. And as you mentioned, if there is opportunities to create incremental value, I think our track record would tell you very strongly that you should expect us to be doing everything taking full advantage of those. Yes. A couple of follow-ups there, Mike. So, the risk of trading down, we have obviously seen a number of different economic cycles during the life of the wireless business. And we don't historically see significant amounts of trade-down during a macro downturn. So, I don't expect anything different, again, because the value that people place on their connectivity products, whether that's broadband or wireless, is higher than ever. So, we will obviously monitor it closely, but history would suggest the risk of that is not that high. And then your last question around integration on roaming, we should largely have the roaming integration, all of the customers, over onto the Verizon network during 2023. We haven't quantified the benefit there, but obviously significant. But that will be \u2013 that should be in the financials by the end of next year. Yes. So, Tim, just on the \u2013 exactly what Hans said on the timing. If you think about it, we are still spending on the LTE network today, and that's obviously 10-plus years from when we launched. So, that's because the usage on the network continues to grow, the utility people get from it continues to grow. And that's why you see our customer base expanding as a result. But as you think about connecting the dots here, as we said, we will be close to 200 million \u2013 well, we will cross 200 million POPs in the first quarter of next year. The $10 billion will largely be spent \u2013 we said there would be a stub left over to next year, so that kind of overlaps there. So, think about it from the standpoint, the $10 billion took care of covering the first roughly 200 million POPs. Then the rest of it goes into BAU. And you create space in BAU because those 200 million POPs have now got C-Band coverage. We said over half of our base has a 5G compatible device in their hands. And so the usage growth in those areas is going on C-Band. That means we don't have to continue spending on LTE in those markets. And then combined with other programs that are coming to an end on the peak spend, such as OneFiber, Intelligent Edge Network, that's the space for the C-Band continued build, both from a coverage and a capacity standpoint, to be in the BAU-level spend, just like as we continue to expand the LTE network for many years. It was part of the BAU-level spend. So, absolutely peak level this year. CapEx comes down next year. And then I would expect even further in \u201824 as the $10 billion is completely gone, as we spoke about earlier this year. And that obviously has a positive impact on free cash flow and the decisions we will be able to have in front of us as a result of that going forward. So, couldn't be happier with the pace at which the team has built it out and spent that money, unbelievable work the team has done there. And it puts us in a great place to reduce CapEx going forward. I think Kyle has said pretty clearly that you should expect \u2013 where you get 4G today, you should be expecting to get 5G in the future as we continue to build out. Yes. Just, Frank, to build on that a little bit. So, absolutely, we expected to see that increase, but it was certainly a good a good trade for us because it drove the gross add increase that we spoke about earlier, also drove a 2% sequential increase in service revenue and 3% in EBITDA. So, we will work through the bubble from that as we go forward. But obviously, the actions produce the type of results that we wanted. We will expect to get back to more normal levels going forward. We constantly have to communicate to our base of customers the value of being on the Verizon network, and that's something that we have got many years of doing. As we have just spoke about a couple of questions ago, the quality of that network with the C-Band build-out is expanding rapidly. And we have the opportunity to continue to demonstrate to customers the premium service they get on Verizon. And as we do that, I am very confident that churn will get back to the levels we would expect it to be. And combined with the improved gross add performance, we will see that show up in the financials, and more importantly, in strong cash flow from the business. So, really happy with the sequential trajectory we have. We need to keep building on that as we go forward here. That's what the team is focused on."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Brad. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor. And I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now, let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.24 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported second quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $435 million, including a net pre-tax charge of approximately $198 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities. In addition, the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $237 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the second quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter was not a good barometer for where Verizon has been or where it\u2019s going. While we are not satisfied with our performance, we know what the issues are. And we are already executing to reaccelerate in the second half of the year. As I said in our first quarter earnings call and reiterated since, we are seeing weaker consumer wireless volumes. The inflationary environment is clearly impacting consumer behavior. And we also saw intensified competition for consumer attention. The result was a significant impact on our gross adds. Based on our performance this quarter and [Indiscernible] of the landscape, we are updating our financial guidance by lowering our expectation for service and other revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Matt will provide more detail in a few minutes. As you know, we have already responded. Last week, we launched our Welcome Unlimited plan for consumer wireless that will meet the needs of budget-conscious consumers without providing device subsidies. In addition to these new plans, we took pricing actions in both of our business units to mitigate inflationary pressures. In consumer, we also adjusted prices for some legacy metered plans, increasing revenue per plan while motivating step-ups to our Unlimited offerings. All of these actions position us for improved performance in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. More than ever, our leadership team is focused on executing our strategy through operational and customer-focused solutions. While I am confident that we have the right strategy in place, we will continue to refine our approach as the consumer market evolves. Looking further into our business, we continue to see momentum that gives us confidence in our ability to improve performance over the long-term. In our Consumer Group, we have consistently pursued a disciplined strategy of offering high-quality services at the competitive prices. We know the economic pressures that our customers are facing and are carefully bringing new offers to meet their needs. I am personally working with the Consumer Group to define our disciplined approach to the market, while also looking closely at how we operate and do business. This is reflected in the plans and promotions we introduced in May, June and July. Mix & Match continues to drive premium plan adoption, with 78% of our consumer base on unlimited plans and 39% on premium unlimited. We have seen healthy step-ups for five consecutive quarters, which continues to drive ARPA growth. And there is room for more. While consumer budgets are becoming strained, we continue to find ways of delivering new valuable services while recognizing that the handset subsidies we are seeing in our industry are not sustainable long-term. Our new Welcome Unlimited plan is a great example of this. We have tailored offers for the full range of Consumer segment from premium to value across postpaid and prepaid to meet all consumer needs in this challenging market condition. In the prepaid value segment, our integration of TracFone is on schedule and provides us with another suite of offerings to bring consumers onto our network. Our fixed wireless access solution continues to bring us new connections. Across consumer and business, we increased fixed wireless net adds by 32% over the first quarter, driven by a 50% increase from our Consumer Group. In our Business Group, we again delivered excellent wireless volumes, with 430,000 net adds, including 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. This marks our third consecutive quarter exceeding 200,000 wireless phone net adds. In the Global Enterprise market, businesses, government agencies and other institutions continue to recognize the power of Verizon\u2019s network and the importance of digitalization. This week, we announced an over $400 million project with FBI to help the Bureau meet its global bandwidth demands, we will provide direct access to our development team and will advise our system enhancements like cloud computing, video and imaging transmission and data applications. We also offer private 5G solutions to optimize complex organizations. We recently partnered with the Virginia International Terminals to build a private 5G network across its Seaports campus. This network is scalable to replace WiFi with more secure connectivity. We are seeing new opportunities and increased demand for these network solutions from enterprises and other organizations. Verizon is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the moment and provide the highest quality private networks to these customers. Private networks are the gateway to mobile edge compute, which can deliver game-changing customer outcomes, including revenue growth, new customer experience and cost savings. During the second quarter, we expanded our MEC ecosystem by bringing AWS Wavelength zones to Nashville and Tampa and now reached 19 metro areas. This means that 75% of the U.S. population is now within 150 miles of Verizon\u2019s 5G Edge. In partnership with Truist, we supported the launch of the 10,000 square foot innovation technology center in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a founding member of the innovators in residence program, we will help create a global hub for the development of 5G and MEC application in the Financial Service segment. This trend will continue to create growth opportunity for us across a range of industries as we are market leader in 5G private networks and in mobile edge compute. The momentum in Verizon Business is a fitting send-off for Group CEO, Tami Erwin, who is ending her amazing 35-year career at Verizon. We promoted Sampath as the Verizon\u2019s Business CEO on July 1. Sampath brings over two decades of experience in digital networks, critical infrastructure protection and a deep understanding on how networks play a role in enterprise growth and global security. He has been part of the Verizon team for more than 8 years. And I know that he is the right leader to take Verizon Business forward. The power of our network gives us the flexibility to meet the needs of our customers across consumer and business. The continued and speedy expansion of our network and capabilities creates agility and optionality within our larger strategy. We ended the quarter with 135 million POPs covered by C-Band and remain on track to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of the year. With the early clearance that we announced in March, we are expanding service into an additional 30 markets and have started deploying 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in many markets across the U.S., almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G. We are seeing the phenomenal performance we expected. Network usage is growing quickly, with C-Band usage up 233% since the end of the first quarter and millimeter wave traffic up 49% year-to-date. Where C-Band is deployed, it accounts for more than a third of our wireless traffic on average. Consumers are also equipped with the devices they need to use 5G. Currently, 47% of our consumer base has a 5G phone and we expect that number to reach nearly 60% by year end. Our already-best wireless network continues to earn recognition for its performance and dependability. This month, J.D. Power gave us the highest number of awards for network quality for the 29th time in a row. And RootMetrics recognized us for having the best overall network performance in the country for the 18th time in 9 years. Turning to the second half of the year, we will continue to listen to our customers and give them reason to sign up, stay and upgrade with us. This month, we also added, on top of our yearly business transformation, a multiyear program to enhance our efficiency measures and actuate the cost benefits delivered. This will ensure that our balance sheet remains strong for the market ahead. We are on the horizon with the goal of growing our business and controlling costs. We will never shy away from investing a portion of our cost savings in our growth initiatives. We are confident in our ability to deliver both efficiency and growth, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Before I turn it over to Matt to give you more details on our results and our outlook for the second half of the year, I want to mention that we reached a tentative deal with our unions to extend our collective bargaining agreement. This extension will provide us with labor stability focused on our customers and opportunities to grow our business over the next 4 years. By that, I hand it over to Matt.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans and good morning everyone. As Hans said, this was a challenging quarter and our results did not meet the expectations we have set for ourselves. We have implemented multiple actions to better position Verizon for the future. At the same time, we expect the market environment to continue to be very competitive for the remainder of 2022. Before discussing our expectations for the remainder of the year, let\u2019s walk through results from the second quarter, beginning with an overview of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our runway for mobility growth is predicated on driving our customer base into higher value data plans and we continue to make good progress in the second quarter. Premium penetration within our consumer base increased to 39% at quarter end and 57% of new accounts in the quarter selected Premium Unlimited and step-ups within our existing base remained healthy. This activity helped drive a 2.4% year-over-year increase in consumer postpaid ARPA. Our recent administrative fee increase and economic adjustment charge began to show up on customers\u2019 bills in the last few days of the second quarter and we expect close to a full quarter\u2019s benefit to revenue and ARPA trends in the third quarter, while our metered price changes will be phased in throughout the third quarter, which will provide an additional uplift. We reported postpaid phone net adds of 12,000 in the second quarter as strong business results more than offset softer consumer performance. Business delivered 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand across all lines of the business group, as phone gross adds were up nearly 30% from the same period a year ago and we expect this strong performance to continue. On the consumer side, postpaid phone net losses were 215,000 in the quarter and stemmed from two main drivers. First, churn increased by 10 basis points compared to the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn contributed roughly half of the increase due to the expiration of state consumer protection policies and less stimulus funding. This was coupled with an 11% decline in phone gross adds from the prior year, driven by the competitive offerings in the marketplace. As Hans indicated, we recently introduced a Welcome plan in order to drive demand for more price-conscious consumers, particularly as they make spending adjustments due to the effects of higher inflation. This new plan is well positioned to attract new customers, especially for those who bring their own device. It is our most basic Unlimited offering with no device promotions or many of the other features available in Mix & Match Unlimited to plans. We reserve our most generous acquisition and retention offers for consumers willing to select our Premium Unlimited plans and we believe that opportunities exist to better serve these high-value customers. Upgrade activity remained elevated throughout the quarter, reflecting loyalty within our core customer base, while also serving to drive greater premium adoption. As a result, total postpaid phone activations across consumer and business were up 8% from the same period last year. Let\u2019s now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. During the second quarter, we continued to scale and grow our nationwide broadband opportunity with additional expansion of fixed wireless households and businesses covered. In addition, we expanded Fios availability to add additional 150,000 homes during the quarter and are on track to achieve our target of 550,000 incremental homes open for sale in 2022. Total broadband net adds were 268,000 in the quarter, an increase of 39,000 sequentially in what is traditionally a seasonally softer quarter. Fixed wireless momentum accelerated as we added 256,000 subscribers in the quarter, up from 194,000 in 1Q. Fixed wireless net adds have increased every month throughout 2022 and we expect to continue that trend in the third quarter. We also added 36,000 Fios Internet net adds during the second quarter. While Fios Internet churn remains well below pre-pandemic levels, we are seeing softer gross adds due to lower-than-expected switching activity from moves and fewer new home purchases. We recently introduced Fios Mix & Match 3.0 that aligns our Fios and fixed wireless pricing and better positions us to grow joint account penetration. Now, let\u2019s talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our integration of TracFone is on track and the team remains focused on enhancing the customer value proposition and delivering cost synergies through migrating off-net customers onto the Verizon network. Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of 227,000 in the second quarter and total Verizon prepaid net losses were 229,000. These results exclude a base adjustment of 402,000 related to a competitor\u2019s 3G shutdown. Our prepaid volumes were impacted by aggressive postpaid promotions. As we made progress on our TracFone integration initiatives, we will be better positioned to serve those customers wanting to migrate to postpaid offerings. Our business case had anticipated subscriber losses during the early phase of the integration period, which we expect to continue into the second half of the year. However, should customer preferences shift to the value market and make recessionary concerns we would expect to see some benefits. Prepaid ARPU was $31.26 in the quarter, up modestly on a sequential basis and we expect it to remain stable going forward. Now, let\u2019s move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was relatively flat year-over-year, as wireless service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue were offset primarily by wireline declines and the net impact of last year\u2019s M&A activity. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.1%, primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, further progress on our Premium Unlimited strategy and strong business volumes. Service and other revenue was down 3.9% for the quarter as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 billion for the quarter, down 2.6% year-over-year due to the divestiture of Verizon Media, higher device subsidies and promotional spending associated with the increased wireless activations, wireline revenue declines and inflationary cost pressures. Regarding inflation, we are seeing the pressures within our cost structure, most notably on labor costs, utilities and transportation and logistics expenses. We expect these pressures to accelerate in the second half of the year and have an impact on profitability and earnings. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.31, down 5.8% from the prior year. This primarily reflects the impact of our adjusted EBITDA results and higher D&A related to our C-Band rollout. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our second quarter consumer financial results. Total consumer revenue for the quarter grew 9.1% year-over-year, driven by the inclusion of TracFone, higher equipment revenue, and core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 10.5% year-over-year, also driven by the inclusion of TracFone and postpaid ARPU growth. Total Fios revenue was flat versus the same period a year ago, as internet growth was offset by video and voice declines. Consumer EBITDA was $10.4 billion, down 0.3% compared to the same period last year. Our higher contribution from TracFone was more than offset primarily by higher promotional activity. Consumer EBITDA margin was 40.5% in the quarter. Now, let\u2019s take a close look at the business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment\u2019s wireless results remained strong in 2Q, while wireline service declines continued amid a softening economy and ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 3.0% was up from 2.1% last quarter. Small and medium business continued its strong momentum, accelerating growth for the second consecutive quarter, while Global Enterprise had its best performance since the first quarter of 2020. Business wireline declines were elevated this quarter, in part due to foreign currency and federal USF, which together impacted growth by more than 300 basis points year-over-year. The secular process from technology migration continued to weigh on legacy voice and data services. And we expect this trend to continue. Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year. In addition to wireline revenue declines, we experienced elevated device subsidies related to the 15% year-over-year increase in wireless activations in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 22.9% in the second quarter. Moving on to Slide 13 on the cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2022 totaled $17.7 billion compared with $20.4 billion in the prior year period. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased inventory levels as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.5 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of $2.8 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $7.2 billion for the first half of the year. We exited the quarter with $130.6 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement of $5 billion, resulting in a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. In a period of rising interest rates, our balance sheet is in a strong position, with less than $2 billion of unsecured bonds maturing in the next 18 months. Lastly, let\u2019s move to an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. We now expect wireless service revenue growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%, down from the prior 9% to 10% range. The pricing actions already implemented are expected to contribute approximately $1 billion in the second half of 2022. However, this benefit is expected to be offset by the accounting impact of promotional activity and the impact of lower net adds. As a result of the reduction in wireless service revenue expectations and anticipated ongoing wireline pressures, we now expect service and other revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to flat. We are lowering our adjusted EBITDA growth expectations for the full year to a range of minus 1.5% to flat versus our prior range of 2% to 3%. This revised outlook accounts for higher levels of activations driven by our promotional activity, inflation-driven costs that we discussed previously, the reduction in wireless service revenue and business wireline revenue headwinds. Our guidance assumes Consumer EBITDA margin in 3Q to be similar to margins seen in the first half, with typical seasonality in 4Q. Business EBITDA margins in the second half of 2022 are expected to be in line with those reported in the first half of the year. Finally, we are lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.10 to $5.25 versus the prior $5.40 to $5.55 range. This fee reflects the reduction in adjusted EBITDA as well as incremental cash interest expense versus our expectations at the beginning of the year of about $300 million for the full year compared with the $150 million to $200 million we estimated last quarter, due to updated market expectations for additional Fed fund rate increases. For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business-as-usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion of C-Band-related spending. In closing, we are confident in our strategy and believe that our assets position us well to generate long-term shareholder value. I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to questions. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. In summary, we view this quarter and second half challenges as short-term. We have a strong and resilient business model that is well suited to deliver favorable financial results, even in uncertain economic times. In this environment, we remain disciplined and focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through improved revenue and profitability, with healthy cash generation that supports our network investments and dividend policy as well as a strong balance sheet. We also have the best team in the industry, and I know they are ready to deliver. The actions we have taken in our Consumer business creates an opportunity to solidify consumer performance. Those actions include new postpaid plans and our continued integration of TracFone. Fixed wireless access for both Consumer and Business has proven to be a powerful connectivity solution. We expect our nationwide broadband presence and our fixed wireless subscriber base to grow well into the future. We continue to drive business wireless subscription and expand our MEC ecosystem. Taken together, and combined with our accelerated efficiency work, our actions during the quarter address our competitive challenges. And we will continue to listen to our customers and thoughtfully respond in the marketplace. Our second quarter initiatives are designed to strengthen our Network-as-a-Service capacity, which uses the power of our network to drive results from our five vectors of growth. Thank you for all, and we\u2019re ready to take your questions. Brady, back to you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we\u2019re ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And two questions, if you don\u2019t mind. Yesterday, AT&T cited that they were seeing a delay in the collections of payments, specifically from their consumer customer base. So I was curious, have you seen any stretching out of DSOs or bad debt expense? And really what\u2019s embedded in your outlook, especially if you\u2019re anticipating that the macro remains a bit tougher? And then the second question is, you outlined some of the steps you\u2019ve taken from a price plan standpoint to sort of better position your Consumer Wireless business. Is there anything else you think you need to do at this point or is it mostly execution-driven? And all in, do you think the steps you have taken so far are sufficient to get back to positive Consumer postpaid phone net adds in the third quarter or at some point in the second half of the year? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brett. I can start with the second part of it. As you said, I mean, we have taken several actions in the quarter, aggressive all the way from the new Unlimited plan with bring your own device and no subsidy. And then, of course, we also have done our increases on the pricing actions we have taken. So we\u2019ve taken that. But we constantly now evaluate if we need to do something more. But we will be very conscious about discipline in the market, because I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s sustainable long-term to continue with the subsidized model. So we will policy in and then policy out. Of course, it\u2019s a holiday season, of course, that will be there. So we will work with that one. But clearly that will do. But remember also, if you look at our value \u2013 our Premium segment, this is, in the high end, we\u2019re doing really well. We have high quality [Indiscernible] customers. You see the step-ups continuing. So what we are addressing right now is the metered and low-end Unlimited, which are more price conscious right now. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re addressing with it. So we are more surgical than just making any blanket decisions here. So that\u2019s very good. And on top of that, we feel good about TracFone. Of course, if the market would turn even worse, I mean we have TracFone. And then we can play in all segments and meet all the demand from different customers. But clearly, we\u2019re staying extremely close with Matt. And I and Manon and her team, we work weekly to see where the market is going, if we need to adjust. But we will always think about how we \u2013 our financial discipline and how we preserve cash. Because we always need to think two times before we bring in customers. We want high-quality customers. Matt, maybe you can comment on the customer base.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. And thanks for the question, Brett. So and actually building on your last comment there, Hans, about high-quality customers, Brett, that shows up in the payment patterns we\u2019re seeing. We haven\u2019t seen any noticeable change in the payment patterns from customers, continues to be very good, very much in line with what we were seeing pre-COVID, in fact, slightly better than that time period. And when you look at the quality of the business we\u2019re writing, the FICO scores in our DPP portfolio have never been higher. So at this point in time, we\u2019re continuing to see the type of strong payment patterns that you would expect from the high-quality customer base that we have.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Great. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good morning. You noted a few times some of the pricing actions that you\u2019ve recently taken, both the price increases but also the recent Unlimited welcome offer at $30. Could you give us a little bit of early reads in the marketplace, your ability for customers to digest these price increases, maybe move to other plans as well as any incremental traffic that you\u2019re seeing from the new Unlimited plans? And are those customers taking that offer? Or is this really driving door swings to maybe trade up to one of the higher offers as well? And then secondly, last quarter, you did talk about store traffic deteriorating in the latter part of the quarter around the war, etcetera. Be great to get a sense of how store traffic trended through 2Q and into Q3. Is it pretty consistent with those levels you saw? Has it deteriorated further? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: On the prices, let me start and Matt will add in there. Of course, the pricing actions we took with price increases and on the metered plan and adjustments, that, we will see coming into play in the second half of this year. So that \u2013 we will, of course, expect some of it. There might be some consumers that are cost conscious that will do disconnects and that we\u2019re calculating with. On the Welcome Unlimited, which is a segmentation of the Unlimited market, it\u2019s a little bit too early to say. It\u2019s only been in the market for, I think, 7 or 8 days. So it\u2019s a little bit early to say. We think we\u2019re addressing the markets \u2013 a part of the market where we had some outflows in the second quarter. And we have taken that action aggressively with this plan. But clearly, we also see opportunities for having step-ups in that plan as well from our customers. Matt, anything more?\nMatt Ellis: No, just one thing I\u2019d add to Hans\u2019 response, Simon. Certainly, we expect to see significant benefit in the second half of the year from the actions we\u2019ve taken. I mentioned that in my comments. That\u2019s probably about $1 billion of incremental revenue sequentially in the second half versus the first half. I would expect, and we have assumed in our forward view, that we will see a small bubble in churn here in the third quarter as a result of customers as they get those price increases on metered plans or whatever else. But apart from that, we expect to see significant benefit from the actions we\u2019ve taken.\nHans Vestberg: And maybe \u2013 sorry, I didn\u2019t answer on the store traffic there, I realized that. So as we said in the first quarter and through the second quarter, we had a little bit less of traffic in our stores in April and May and the latter part of March. We saw some pickup in June, but still a little bit below earlier trends. But that might be just the market and how it\u2019s working right now. But other than that, nothing special.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. First as follow-up, if I can. And I don\u2019t mean this to sound disrespectful. But on one hand, you\u2019re raising prices with fees. On the other hand, you\u2019re bringing in lower-priced discounted offers. And I know you\u2019re offering loyalty credits to customers who call and complain about pricing. And it seems like you\u2019re out of the market. So do you think that your network is going to return to its dominance, and you can sort of get through this period? Or do you think you need to really readdress your competitive position in order to maintain share? I\u2019m sorry to return to something you\u2019ve talked about a few times already, but I\u2019m really having a hard time with it. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Phil. First of all, we feel really good about our network and the quality of the network. It\u2019s actually better than ever and as you hear us talking as well. We are just in the midst of the C-Band rollout, which is extremely strong and the performance we see on it. And we just are passing over 130 million plus POPs on it, by year-end at least 175 million. So we\u2019re going to have many more customers getting the benefit of the C-Band. So now we feel good about that our revenues. You saw the RootMetrics. You saw the \u2013 both of the J.D. Power as well and having us as the best network. So we don\u2019t feel that is different. What we\u2019re doing right now, I think that\u2019s \u2013 you have to be clear \u2013 very clear, Phil. We are segmenting the market. So where we now have the Welcome plan, that\u2019s a segment of the Unlimited and metered plan. On the high end, we have \u2013 as Matt said, we have really good sort of loyalty. We see step-ups. Exactly as we outlined in our plans, that\u2019s what we [seeing continued] (ph). And that\u2019s why we saw the ARPA increase in this quarter, and we see continuous step-up. So I think, not only think, I\u2019m confident our strategy is working. We\u2019re just addressing a segment in this economical time. So I feel really good about the strategy and how we do it. And we will continue to be very focused on cash flow and getting the right type of customers, because we believe high-quality customers are important. And that means loyalty. It means also a very good base to build on. So we feel good about the strategy. I understand your question, but I feel really good about it. Matt, anything else?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Hans, maybe the only other thing I\u2019d add on is, Phil, one of the things we\u2019ve done during the current quarter, we mentioned last time that we\u2019ve reached an agreement with some of the satellite companies to get early clearing on outside the initial 46 C-Band markets. And in those markets, we\u2019re not turning on 60 megahertz, but 100 megahertz of the C-Band. And the difference in the speeds that we\u2019re seeing with 100 megahertz versus 60 is exactly in line with what we\u2019d expect. But it tells us that we have a path to a very, very strong network performance. We really like what we\u2019re seeing on C-Band today. But when we get the full amount deployed, it\u2019s going to be an uptick even further. So we absolutely believe that a network-driven strategy will allow us to continue to perform very well.\nPhil Cusick: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Phil. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Betsy for John. Can you talk a little bit about how you expect fixed wireless trends to trend from here? Is there an opportunity to expand maybe the addressable market as you build C-Band further? And maybe an update of what percent of that fixed wireless base is new to Verizon. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Hey, great question. No, first of all, we feel really good about our five vectors of growth. And in one of the vectors, of course, we have national broadband. This was exactly what we envisioned when we rolled out the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network in 2017, that we can have multiple opportunities to address the market. And fixed wire actually is just humming for us. I mean, 32% growth, 50% growth in the Consumer Group. This is all about us deploying the network. Of course, we have millimeter wave and we have 4G in the fixed wireless access, but the C-Band both, they gave a coverage and an enormous good performance as well. So as we rollout and hitting more households, we are going to we can grow even faster. So our expectation, Betsy, is of course, we will continue to have that opportunity to grow right now from the base we have as we\u2019re opening most households. But remember, from the opening household to [indiscernible] etcetera, is a little bit time lag because the direct marketing and all of that is working through. But we feel really good about. We feel also good about our Fios, even though it was a little bit less of net adds on Fios because less movements, I guess, in this environment, nothing strange. But really good performance on Fios when it comes to the network and our customer base and your churn. So all in all, the national broadband is playing really good for us. And this was a strategy from the beginning. I have high expectations. Matt has high expectation on as well. Our teams are executing from the network to our commercials. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Hey, Pat, so just maybe one data point for you on fixed wireless. About 30% of our FWA adds, what we would call new, new to Verizon, where we didn\u2019t have an existing relationship with them. So obviously, we like the ability of taking an existing Verizon customer and adding a service. But when you bring a completely new customer on the platform, that\u2019s pretty exciting as well. So hopefully, that helps your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Betsy. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess my first one, Matt, we\u2019ve thrown out a couple of numbers, $1 billion of top line and incremental benefit from pricing plans, maybe $300 million of incremental interest from presumably floating rate debt. Can we talk about some of the other numbers you talked about, we threw out some math around inflation and the impact it could have on the $20 billion of expenses that\u2019s exposed to inflation? Kind of what\u2019s the inflation headwind dollar number that you\u2019re budgeting for? And then when we talked about this equipment and supply chain working capital headwind, what kind of dollar number are we talking about there? And then, Hans, I think you mentioned in passing the CB agreement or agreement in principle that you signed, I think last week. It seems like a potentially dangerous time with the inflation that we have around us right now to be kind of locking into multiyear collective bargaining agreements. Could you talk about why this is happening and why you feel comfortable doing it now? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks Dave. So, thank you for the question. So, look, as you think about the guide at the EBITDA level, as you say, there is about $1 billion of revenue sequential uptick. But then the offset to that, you have got the promotional spend that is certainly running at a higher level than we thought at the beginning of the year based off what we are seeing in the marketplace. And we are making the assumption that we are going to see that type of level for the balance of the year that\u2019s based in there of the reduction in EBITDA growth from the 2% to 3% down to the minus 1.5% to flat, 75 basis points to 100 basis points of that is coming from inflation and our assumption of that for the full year versus our original plans for the year. On the working capital side, you have got a couple of things playing in there. One is, over the last couple of years, we have had some artificial working capital headwinds caused by COVID as volumes came down. Transaction volumes came down. That gave us some lower EPP balances that was a favor to working capital. We now, of course, see volumes increasing again. And so you have got that reverting to more normal levels, on top of which, moving to 36-month EPP will increase the amount of outstanding balances versus what we saw pre-COVID. So, we will work through a large chunk of that this year. And I would expect to see less of a working capital headwind half of this year, but that\u2019s certainly in the \u2013 you will see that in the free cash flow right now. We feel very good about the cash flow generation about the business going forward and what we will achieve as we work through this current period. Hans, I will hand it over to you for the union question.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thank you. And maybe a comment on the supply chain because there is a lot of discussion around that. And I have to say that Verizon has done a great job on our supply chain around the whole supply chain and secure that. I mean you can see that in our rollout on our C-Band millimeter wave and everything else we are doing in the network that were way ahead of our earlier plans. And that\u2019s of course, how we have secured our supply chain, I really want to say. When it comes to the unions, I mean we have reached, as I said in my remarks, we have reached a tentative agreement on the union agreement with them. And we have a great partnership with the union. So, we think this is an important one. You have to see that we secured the workloads we have in the future and see that we continue to have a great working relationship with the union. So, that\u2019s why we have this tentative agreement.\nDavid Barden: Great.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. You are discussing the strength of your Business Wireless segment. And your competitors are also talking about stronger business wireless performance. I am just curious if there is something larger afoot within this segment in terms of behavior and the way businesses are buying wireless? Related to that, is that possibly coming out of what was traditionally the consumer market? So, is there some kind of shift that\u2019s also happening underneath the industry in terms of where sales are coming into? And then just one other, I am just thinking about what you talked about in terms of the change in guidance for revenue and EBITDA for this year. And I am curious how this informs the multi-year outlook that the company previously established in the relationship you are seeing longer term between the performance of revenue and profitability.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. On the business wireless, you have seen us now for several quarters having a really good run on it. Our conclusion and our confidence level is high that our mission-critical networks is so important for our customers. And that\u2019s why we see such a good traction on it. I think it\u2019s normally, there are probably some leakage in between consumer to small and medium, but it\u2019s also from small and medium or consumer, the small and medium. So, that I don\u2019t think is anything different than what I have seen before, but it\u2019s always some type of movements in between. So, we feel really good about our business wireless and how they are performing and how our customers like our network. On the second question, as I said also before, I mean we think it\u2019s a short-term challenging times right now. Long-term, we are confident that this is a great market. We have great assets. And we can execute on our plans. So, I am \u2013 whatever we have done in the last 5 years here, with the network, with our divestments and acquisitions, we have positioned ourselves for a really good long-term strategy in a market where mobility, broadband and cloud are the most important digital assets for consumers and businesses. I couldn\u2019t dream to have another position that we have today. So, I am confident about the long-term of our business. Matt, anything else?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Hans, maybe just a couple of things. Mike, if you think back pre-COVID, Verizon Business Group had very strong performance. Obviously, COVID was very disruptive to the Business segment. You have seen the recovery in net adds over the past year now be very strong. And you are seeing that show up in the service revenue growth, up to 3% this quarter, up sequentially two quarters in a row now. And we do expect that to continue at a strong pace. And as Hans said, we are not going to comment on multiyear outlook at this point, but certainly feel like the actions that we are taking and have taken and will continue to work on put us on a path to EBITDA growth as we go forward here. So, look forward to, obviously, updating you on that as we get into next year.\nMichael Rollins: One just quick follow-up, if I could. With going through the pandemic and kind of where we are today, there is a bigger work-from-home and hybrid working environment. Is that emboldening companies to kind of shift from what felt like for years, they were trying to get out of like buying devices and services for their employees. And is that involving them to now, because of this different work environment, actually buy wireless communications on behalf of their employees differently than maybe 2 years or 3 years ago?\nHans Vestberg: Thanks. I think I actually see both. I mean we see \u2013 we saw a trend over the years of bring your own device from enterprises. But actually in order to secure a more seamless experience for enterprise customers, we see more we see more now customers actually going back and actually supplying the devices of our customers. It\u2019s a little bit dependent on what type of business they are into, I have to say. But we see a little bit of a trend going down the direction right now. Think about building private 5G networks, where you want everybody to have a seamless wireless \u2013 5G wireless experience inside an office and then going out on the street and having Verizon\u2019s commercial network. Then you need to deploy a handset that is actually coming from the company in order to manage it. So, we see actually both. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accentuated trend, at least as I can tell from taking the question on this level. On the other thing, I just want to give another data point as well. I mean remember, I talked a lot about handoffs in the networks during COVID was sometimes down 60% in New York City that people didn\u2019t move. We are back to the hands of \u2013 that means handovers. It seems like people are moving equally much right now as we are doing pre-COVID. It\u2019s, of course, a different buckets. But on the high level, when we look at the network, handovers are back to normal and actually even a little bit more. That can of course, depend on that how much more equipment we have deployed in 2 years. But that\u2019s what we see.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Mike. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. Hans, I wonder as we think about growth, maybe we revisit some of the comments you have made over the past couple of years about 5G. As the market has evolved, what is your latest thinking about the opportunity, both for the industry and for Verizon specifically as it relates to some of the new revenue opportunities that seem so promising a couple of years back, like mobile edge compute and private networks and that sort of thing? Is there \u2013 is it right that, I think there is a broad sense among investors that sort of the bloom is off the road a bit for those opportunities, and they may not be as big and as attractive as we once would have hoped?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. If we take the three different business models we deployed in the network for 5G. I mean fixed wire access, if I take that first, that definitely is happening all the way that everybody was questioning if fixed wireless is actually something you can do. We feel really good about it. The capacity in the network is there is no problem. And as Matt said, we have deployed 60 megahertz of the C-Band, we have in average 160. So, we have so much more to go. So, that one is definitely happening. On the mobility, 5G mobility, yes, short-term is a little bit more challenging. I think that comes from both economical situation in the market. Long-term, I see the same. As I said before, the step-ups and going to higher plans is a great opportunity for us. And as you saw in this quarter, our ARPA went up. Our high-end customers continued to do step up. So, both of those are happening. And 47% of our customers has a 5G phone. And by year-end, we would probably be near at least 60%. So, I think those are happening. On the contrary, mobile edge compute and IoT, we also have a really good trend on that, has a little bit right now, and starting with private 5G networks and then it goes over to mobile edge compute, when you bring in the cloud experience in it. So, you saw that during the quarter, we announced several private 5G networks. We see more and more customers feeling that. That\u2019s a good replacement for them in order to have a secure high-capacity network instead of having WiFi in many cases. And the reason why it\u2019s happening right now is now devices are coming out. And the next couple of years, we are going to see so many more devices and not talking only about smartphones. So, I feel that it is the same opportunity that we have talked about all the time. Given the economic environment, it might be always some changes to it. But long-term, I see no difference in it. And that\u2019s how we build the network. And we are the world leader in mobile edge compute and private 5G networks. We feel that, that\u2019s a sweet spot for us. We have been all the time being very early with other 5G use case as well and feel really good where we are. So, I understand your question, Craig. But in general, I am confident that, well, this is a great opportunity for the market.\nCraig Moffett: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Craig. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So, maybe a couple. I mean first, from a price increase perspective, when you look at what you have done, it\u2019s a bigger part of your base that\u2019s absorbing the price increase than AT&T. And despite that and the growth of telco and cable revenues, the service revenue growth guidance was down and EBITDA growth was negative. So, in terms of growth, you may need to lean on other levers, I guess in order to grow margins beyond this year. So, if you could just help us understand what those levers are, especially if the macro environment starts getting weaker? I mean how do you keep your margins intact? And then secondly, there seems to be an enormous amount of handset inventory that you have built up over the last two quarters or three quarters on your balance sheet. It would be great if you could help us understand what the objective there is and if we should expect some kind of a clearing event around the holidays. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thank you, Kannan. First of all, when it comes to the margin, I mean there are many levers to run here. Of course, one is of course, continue to see that we have good opportunity to grow. And remember, we have five vectors of growth. And some of them might be more impacted if the economic and environment is turning worse, but many of them actually are playing well in the hands in a market like that, like fixed wire access, like our value brand with TracFone and all of that. So, again, I feel that we have opportunity to expand by having those performing, if it\u2019s going to be tougher on some others. And then, of course, cost. I mean we always work with cost. And as Matt has outlined several times, we work with cost efficiency and programs constantly. And now we are adding efficiency programs or enhancing what we have in order to be prepared for tougher times and being able to invest in the market. So, I think we have all the things that we should have. And I am confident that we have toolbox that we are working with. And the team is on it every day, and we will continue to be on it. It is an environment that\u2019s a little bit complicated, I think for any company at the moment. But I feel that we know what we are doing here. We are confident about our strategy. We are confident about our cash generation, and we are confident that we will be financially disciplined through this time. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, Hans, nothing really to add on the margin side. There are obviously a number of apps forward for us. And we will \u2013 we have high expectations for the results we will produce. On the inventory part of your question, we took a decision that, I think was obviously a smart way of approach in the market to say there was more uncertainty around supply chain, both the availability of the physical item and also the supply chain\u2019s ability to deliver that item from factory to us in a predictable fashion. And so we have built some cushion into our supply chain model. And you can see that in the inventory levels. There is certainly scope for us as we feel more comfortable about the predictability of the supply chain to return inventory levels closer to historical levels is once you account for the difference in rates of the price of the product. But certainly, absolutely, I would expect to see inventory levels have the opportunity to reduce.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Kannan. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Can you talk to us a little bit about the business market with government? And any changes you are seeing there? And then at what point can we expect to see the consumer subs get back to something you are approaching a more positive growth with your current promotion strategy? Is that something more out into next year? I understand the confidence in the network and so forth, but at some point, we would like to see that kind of show up in the subs. What can \u2013 where can we expect that to start to turn?\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thank you, Frank. Let me start with the business \u2013 with the governmental business. And of course, in governmental business a little bit longer contracts. Of course, they come up for renovation now and then. I think what we see much more is the digitalization happens in that segment as well, equally much as with enterprises and much more about us supplying all business models with digitalization and applications and support them with the ways of working. So, that has been good. And as we announced yesterday, one of them with one governmental agency definitely included that. So, we see the government going the same way as an enterprise market going with digitalization, which includes applications, wireless technology, fiber technology in order to see that their employees and their services have the latest technologies. And that I think we are playing well into, given the network we have and the confidence that everybody have in our network from, so I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s happening. Matt, on the consumer side?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So look, obviously, we \u2013 the team continues to work through the competitive marketplace, as I mentioned earlier. I do expect to see a topple in a little bit of a problem in churn in the third quarter here because of some customer reaction to the pricing actions we have taken. We would expect to compete effectively during the holiday season as we get into new device launches in the fourth quarter. So, I would expect us to start to show up with obviously different numbers at that time of the year. And then we will continue to work to be as competitive on a disciplined fashion in the market as we need to be.\nFrank Louthan: Alright. Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Frank. Brad, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your final question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open sir.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Hans, I think your commentary on handset subsidies is about as strong as we have heard from you. For your premium customers, do you believe then that streaming gives you a much better mileage for your promo dollar than handset subsidies, or should we expect you to reconsider streaming subsidies as well? I am just thinking, with your new plan on the more price-conscious consumer side, is it just price that\u2019s going to swing those customers over to Verizon, or is other factors like a value offering with bundled 5G home or streaming subsidies, something that might work just as well? Obviously, the value customers have broadband and probably have streaming at home as well. Just curious how you are thinking about evolving the price-sensitive offering? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. First of all, on the different type of value services we have in the high end or in the Premium segment, if it\u2019s Disney+ or others, we think that\u2019s very important still. And we see our customers really liking it. And we have been in the forefront of this industry with these type of exclusive deals with the most prominent brands you can ever think about. We will continue to do that for our high-end customers. And that has really turned out well for us and our partners. And in \u2013 during the second half of this year as well as we announced at the Investor Day, we also want to launch a Plus Play, which is a platform for digital subscription aggregation for our customers. You have seen basically, I wouldn\u2019t say everyone because there is many in the market. But the majority of the important brands has signed up with us. So, we will continue to leverage both sort of network and service but also distribution as a service for our customers and for us in order to have the best return on investment. So, we feel good about that. And as you see in the marketplace, I mean digital subscription services is just popping up direct-to-consumer all over the place, nowhere better to work with than working with Verizon that has the biggest direct-to-consumer distribution in the market. So, we have a lot of inbounds. We are going to do it right. We are going to see that our customers and our shareholders are benefiting from it. When it comes to the question about subsidy and all of that and segmentation, and as clearly articulated, we try to be surgical in our changes, both on prices and on step-ups and all of that. And right now, the team working diligently, has been on the segment that is hitting low-end unlimited and metered plan. We are going to see and have opportunities there to bundle in other things. We are already working with our fixed wireless access offering for our customers that are wireless customers with very good value proposition. So, we will continue that and see if there are other things we need to bundle in. But right now, we have, I think a very strong positioning. And we are taking aggressive actions in the quarter, some confidence that we will continue to see improvements here over time.\nDoug Mitchelson: Alright. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Doug. Brad, that\u2019s all the questions we have for today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter was not a good barometer for where Verizon has been or where it's going. While we are not satisfied with our performance, we know what the issues are. And we are already executing to reaccelerate in the second half of the year. As I said in our first quarter earnings call and reiterated since, we are seeing weaker consumer wireless volumes. The inflationary environment is clearly impacting consumer behavior. And we also saw intensified competition for consumer attention. The result was a significant impact on our gross adds. Based on our performance this quarter and [Indiscernible] of the landscape, we are updating our financial guidance by lowering our expectation for service and other revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Matt will provide more detail in a few minutes. As you know, we have already responded. Last week, we launched our Welcome Unlimited plan for consumer wireless that will meet the needs of budget-conscious consumers without providing device subsidies. In addition to these new plans, we took pricing actions in both of our business units to mitigate inflationary pressures. In consumer, we also adjusted prices for some legacy metered plans, increasing revenue per plan while motivating step-ups to our Unlimited offerings. All of these actions position us for improved performance in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. More than ever, our leadership team is focused on executing our strategy through operational and customer-focused solutions. While I am confident that we have the right strategy in place, we will continue to refine our approach as the consumer market evolves. Looking further into our business, we continue to see momentum that gives us confidence in our ability to improve performance over the long-term. In our Consumer Group, we have consistently pursued a disciplined strategy of offering high-quality services at the competitive prices. We know the economic pressures that our customers are facing and are carefully bringing new offers to meet their needs. I am personally working with the Consumer Group to define our disciplined approach to the market, while also looking closely at how we operate and do business. This is reflected in the plans and promotions we introduced in May, June and July. Mix & Match continues to drive premium plan adoption, with 78% of our consumer base on unlimited plans and 39% on premium unlimited. We have seen healthy step-ups for five consecutive quarters, which continues to drive ARPA growth. And there is room for more. While consumer budgets are becoming strained, we continue to find ways of delivering new valuable services while recognizing that the handset subsidies we are seeing in our industry are not sustainable long-term. Our new Welcome Unlimited plan is a great example of this. We have tailored offers for the full range of Consumer segment from premium to value across postpaid and prepaid to meet all consumer needs in this challenging market condition. In the prepaid value segment, our integration of TracFone is on schedule and provides us with another suite of offerings to bring consumers onto our network. Our fixed wireless access solution continues to bring us new connections. Across consumer and business, we increased fixed wireless net adds by 32% over the first quarter, driven by a 50% increase from our Consumer Group. In our Business Group, we again delivered excellent wireless volumes, with 430,000 net adds, including 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. This marks our third consecutive quarter exceeding 200,000 wireless phone net adds. In the Global Enterprise market, businesses, government agencies and other institutions continue to recognize the power of Verizon's network and the importance of digitalization. This week, we announced an over $400 million project with FBI to help the Bureau meet its global bandwidth demands, we will provide direct access to our development team and will advise our system enhancements like cloud computing, video and imaging transmission and data applications. We also offer private 5G solutions to optimize complex organizations. We recently partnered with the Virginia International Terminals to build a private 5G network across its Seaports campus. This network is scalable to replace WiFi with more secure connectivity. We are seeing new opportunities and increased demand for these network solutions from enterprises and other organizations. Verizon is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the moment and provide the highest quality private networks to these customers. Private networks are the gateway to mobile edge compute, which can deliver game-changing customer outcomes, including revenue growth, new customer experience and cost savings. During the second quarter, we expanded our MEC ecosystem by bringing AWS Wavelength zones to Nashville and Tampa and now reached 19 metro areas. This means that 75% of the U.S. population is now within 150 miles of Verizon's 5G Edge. In partnership with Truist, we supported the launch of the 10,000 square foot innovation technology center in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a founding member of the innovators in residence program, we will help create a global hub for the development of 5G and MEC application in the Financial Service segment. This trend will continue to create growth opportunity for us across a range of industries as we are market leader in 5G private networks and in mobile edge compute. The momentum in Verizon Business is a fitting send-off for Group CEO, Tami Erwin, who is ending her amazing 35-year career at Verizon. We promoted Sampath as the Verizon's Business CEO on July 1. Sampath brings over two decades of experience in digital networks, critical infrastructure protection and a deep understanding on how networks play a role in enterprise growth and global security. He has been part of the Verizon team for more than 8 years. And I know that he is the right leader to take Verizon Business forward. The power of our network gives us the flexibility to meet the needs of our customers across consumer and business. The continued and speedy expansion of our network and capabilities creates agility and optionality within our larger strategy. We ended the quarter with 135 million POPs covered by C-Band and remain on track to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of the year. With the early clearance that we announced in March, we are expanding service into an additional 30 markets and have started deploying 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in many markets across the U.S., almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G. We are seeing the phenomenal performance we expected. Network usage is growing quickly, with C-Band usage up 233% since the end of the first quarter and millimeter wave traffic up 49% year-to-date. Where C-Band is deployed, it accounts for more than a third of our wireless traffic on average. Consumers are also equipped with the devices they need to use 5G. Currently, 47% of our consumer base has a 5G phone and we expect that number to reach nearly 60% by year end. Our already-best wireless network continues to earn recognition for its performance and dependability. This month, J.D. Power gave us the highest number of awards for network quality for the 29th time in a row. And RootMetrics recognized us for having the best overall network performance in the country for the 18th time in 9 years. Turning to the second half of the year, we will continue to listen to our customers and give them reason to sign up, stay and upgrade with us. This month, we also added, on top of our yearly business transformation, a multiyear program to enhance our efficiency measures and actuate the cost benefits delivered. This will ensure that our balance sheet remains strong for the market ahead. We are on the horizon with the goal of growing our business and controlling costs. We will never shy away from investing a portion of our cost savings in our growth initiatives. We are confident in our ability to deliver both efficiency and growth, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Before I turn it over to Matt to give you more details on our results and our outlook for the second half of the year, I want to mention that we reached a tentative deal with our unions to extend our collective bargaining agreement. This extension will provide us with labor stability focused on our customers and opportunities to grow our business over the next 4 years. By that, I hand it over to Matt. Thank you, Matt. In summary, we view this quarter and second half challenges as short-term. We have a strong and resilient business model that is well suited to deliver favorable financial results, even in uncertain economic times. In this environment, we remain disciplined and focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through improved revenue and profitability, with healthy cash generation that supports our network investments and dividend policy as well as a strong balance sheet. We also have the best team in the industry, and I know they are ready to deliver. The actions we have taken in our Consumer business creates an opportunity to solidify consumer performance. Those actions include new postpaid plans and our continued integration of TracFone. Fixed wireless access for both Consumer and Business has proven to be a powerful connectivity solution. We expect our nationwide broadband presence and our fixed wireless subscriber base to grow well into the future. We continue to drive business wireless subscription and expand our MEC ecosystem. Taken together, and combined with our accelerated efficiency work, our actions during the quarter address our competitive challenges. And we will continue to listen to our customers and thoughtfully respond in the marketplace. Our second quarter initiatives are designed to strengthen our Network-as-a-Service capacity, which uses the power of our network to drive results from our five vectors of growth. Thank you for all, and we're ready to take your questions. Brady, back to you. Thank you, Brett. I can start with the second part of it. As you said, I mean, we have taken several actions in the quarter, aggressive all the way from the new Unlimited plan with bring your own device and no subsidy. And then, of course, we also have done our increases on the pricing actions we have taken. So we've taken that. But we constantly now evaluate if we need to do something more. But we will be very conscious about discipline in the market, because I don't think that it's sustainable long-term to continue with the subsidized model. So we will policy in and then policy out. Of course, it's a holiday season, of course, that will be there. So we will work with that one. But clearly that will do. But remember also, if you look at our value \u2013 our Premium segment, this is, in the high end, we're doing really well. We have high quality [Indiscernible] customers. You see the step-ups continuing. So what we are addressing right now is the metered and low-end Unlimited, which are more price conscious right now. And that's what we're addressing with it. So we are more surgical than just making any blanket decisions here. So that's very good. And on top of that, we feel good about TracFone. Of course, if the market would turn even worse, I mean we have TracFone. And then we can play in all segments and meet all the demand from different customers. But clearly, we're staying extremely close with Matt. And I and Manon and her team, we work weekly to see where the market is going, if we need to adjust. But we will always think about how we \u2013 our financial discipline and how we preserve cash. Because we always need to think two times before we bring in customers. We want high-quality customers. Matt, maybe you can comment on the customer base. On the prices, let me start and Matt will add in there. Of course, the pricing actions we took with price increases and on the metered plan and adjustments, that, we will see coming into play in the second half of this year. So that \u2013 we will, of course, expect some of it. There might be some consumers that are cost conscious that will do disconnects and that we're calculating with. On the Welcome Unlimited, which is a segmentation of the Unlimited market, it's a little bit too early to say. It's only been in the market for, I think, 7 or 8 days. So it's a little bit early to say. We think we're addressing the markets \u2013 a part of the market where we had some outflows in the second quarter. And we have taken that action aggressively with this plan. But clearly, we also see opportunities for having step-ups in that plan as well from our customers. Matt, anything more? And maybe \u2013 sorry, I didn't answer on the store traffic there, I realized that. So as we said in the first quarter and through the second quarter, we had a little bit less of traffic in our stores in April and May and the latter part of March. We saw some pickup in June, but still a little bit below earlier trends. But that might be just the market and how it's working right now. But other than that, nothing special. Thank you, Phil. First of all, we feel really good about our network and the quality of the network. It's actually better than ever and as you hear us talking as well. We are just in the midst of the C-Band rollout, which is extremely strong and the performance we see on it. And we just are passing over 130 million plus POPs on it, by year-end at least 175 million. So we're going to have many more customers getting the benefit of the C-Band. So now we feel good about that our revenues. You saw the RootMetrics. You saw the \u2013 both of the J.D. Power as well and having us as the best network. So we don't feel that is different. What we're doing right now, I think that's \u2013 you have to be clear \u2013 very clear, Phil. We are segmenting the market. So where we now have the Welcome plan, that's a segment of the Unlimited and metered plan. On the high end, we have \u2013 as Matt said, we have really good sort of loyalty. We see step-ups. Exactly as we outlined in our plans, that's what we [seeing continued] (ph). And that's why we saw the ARPA increase in this quarter, and we see continuous step-up. So I think, not only think, I'm confident our strategy is working. We're just addressing a segment in this economical time. So I feel really good about the strategy and how we do it. And we will continue to be very focused on cash flow and getting the right type of customers, because we believe high-quality customers are important. And that means loyalty. It means also a very good base to build on. So we feel good about the strategy. I understand your question, but I feel really good about it. Matt, anything else? Hey, great question. No, first of all, we feel really good about our five vectors of growth. And in one of the vectors, of course, we have national broadband. This was exactly what we envisioned when we rolled out the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network in 2017, that we can have multiple opportunities to address the market. And fixed wire actually is just humming for us. I mean, 32% growth, 50% growth in the Consumer Group. This is all about us deploying the network. Of course, we have millimeter wave and we have 4G in the fixed wireless access, but the C-Band both, they gave a coverage and an enormous good performance as well. So as we rollout and hitting more households, we are going to we can grow even faster. So our expectation, Betsy, is of course, we will continue to have that opportunity to grow right now from the base we have as we're opening most households. But remember, from the opening household to [indiscernible] etcetera, is a little bit time lag because the direct marketing and all of that is working through. But we feel really good about. We feel also good about our Fios, even though it was a little bit less of net adds on Fios because less movements, I guess, in this environment, nothing strange. But really good performance on Fios when it comes to the network and our customer base and your churn. So all in all, the national broadband is playing really good for us. And this was a strategy from the beginning. I have high expectations. Matt has high expectation on as well. Our teams are executing from the network to our commercials. Matt? Matt? Yes. Thank you. And maybe a comment on the supply chain because there is a lot of discussion around that. And I have to say that Verizon has done a great job on our supply chain around the whole supply chain and secure that. I mean you can see that in our rollout on our C-Band millimeter wave and everything else we are doing in the network that were way ahead of our earlier plans. And that's of course, how we have secured our supply chain, I really want to say. When it comes to the unions, I mean we have reached, as I said in my remarks, we have reached a tentative agreement on the union agreement with them. And we have a great partnership with the union. So, we think this is an important one. You have to see that we secured the workloads we have in the future and see that we continue to have a great working relationship with the union. So, that's why we have this tentative agreement. Thank you. On the business wireless, you have seen us now for several quarters having a really good run on it. Our conclusion and our confidence level is high that our mission-critical networks is so important for our customers. And that's why we see such a good traction on it. I think it's normally, there are probably some leakage in between consumer to small and medium, but it's also from small and medium or consumer, the small and medium. So, that I don't think is anything different than what I have seen before, but it's always some type of movements in between. So, we feel really good about our business wireless and how they are performing and how our customers like our network. On the second question, as I said also before, I mean we think it's a short-term challenging times right now. Long-term, we are confident that this is a great market. We have great assets. And we can execute on our plans. So, I am \u2013 whatever we have done in the last 5 years here, with the network, with our divestments and acquisitions, we have positioned ourselves for a really good long-term strategy in a market where mobility, broadband and cloud are the most important digital assets for consumers and businesses. I couldn't dream to have another position that we have today. So, I am confident about the long-term of our business. Matt, anything else? Thanks. I think I actually see both. I mean we see \u2013 we saw a trend over the years of bring your own device from enterprises. But actually in order to secure a more seamless experience for enterprise customers, we see more we see more now customers actually going back and actually supplying the devices of our customers. It's a little bit dependent on what type of business they are into, I have to say. But we see a little bit of a trend going down the direction right now. Think about building private 5G networks, where you want everybody to have a seamless wireless \u2013 5G wireless experience inside an office and then going out on the street and having Verizon's commercial network. Then you need to deploy a handset that is actually coming from the company in order to manage it. So, we see actually both. So, I don't think it's an accentuated trend, at least as I can tell from taking the question on this level. On the other thing, I just want to give another data point as well. I mean remember, I talked a lot about handoffs in the networks during COVID was sometimes down 60% in New York City that people didn't move. We are back to the hands of \u2013 that means handovers. It seems like people are moving equally much right now as we are doing pre-COVID. It's, of course, a different buckets. But on the high level, when we look at the network, handovers are back to normal and actually even a little bit more. That can of course, depend on that how much more equipment we have deployed in 2 years. But that's what we see. Thank you, Craig. If we take the three different business models we deployed in the network for 5G. I mean fixed wire access, if I take that first, that definitely is happening all the way that everybody was questioning if fixed wireless is actually something you can do. We feel really good about it. The capacity in the network is there is no problem. And as Matt said, we have deployed 60 megahertz of the C-Band, we have in average 160. So, we have so much more to go. So, that one is definitely happening. On the mobility, 5G mobility, yes, short-term is a little bit more challenging. I think that comes from both economical situation in the market. Long-term, I see the same. As I said before, the step-ups and going to higher plans is a great opportunity for us. And as you saw in this quarter, our ARPA went up. Our high-end customers continued to do step up. So, both of those are happening. And 47% of our customers has a 5G phone. And by year-end, we would probably be near at least 60%. So, I think those are happening. On the contrary, mobile edge compute and IoT, we also have a really good trend on that, has a little bit right now, and starting with private 5G networks and then it goes over to mobile edge compute, when you bring in the cloud experience in it. So, you saw that during the quarter, we announced several private 5G networks. We see more and more customers feeling that. That's a good replacement for them in order to have a secure high-capacity network instead of having WiFi in many cases. And the reason why it's happening right now is now devices are coming out. And the next couple of years, we are going to see so many more devices and not talking only about smartphones. So, I feel that it is the same opportunity that we have talked about all the time. Given the economic environment, it might be always some changes to it. But long-term, I see no difference in it. And that's how we build the network. And we are the world leader in mobile edge compute and private 5G networks. We feel that, that's a sweet spot for us. We have been all the time being very early with other 5G use case as well and feel really good where we are. So, I understand your question, Craig. But in general, I am confident that, well, this is a great opportunity for the market. Yes. Thank you, Kannan. First of all, when it comes to the margin, I mean there are many levers to run here. Of course, one is of course, continue to see that we have good opportunity to grow. And remember, we have five vectors of growth. And some of them might be more impacted if the economic and environment is turning worse, but many of them actually are playing well in the hands in a market like that, like fixed wire access, like our value brand with TracFone and all of that. So, again, I feel that we have opportunity to expand by having those performing, if it's going to be tougher on some others. And then, of course, cost. I mean we always work with cost. And as Matt has outlined several times, we work with cost efficiency and programs constantly. And now we are adding efficiency programs or enhancing what we have in order to be prepared for tougher times and being able to invest in the market. So, I think we have all the things that we should have. And I am confident that we have toolbox that we are working with. And the team is on it every day, and we will continue to be on it. It is an environment that's a little bit complicated, I think for any company at the moment. But I feel that we know what we are doing here. We are confident about our strategy. We are confident about our cash generation, and we are confident that we will be financially disciplined through this time. Matt? Yes. Thank you, Frank. Let me start with the business \u2013 with the governmental business. And of course, in governmental business a little bit longer contracts. Of course, they come up for renovation now and then. I think what we see much more is the digitalization happens in that segment as well, equally much as with enterprises and much more about us supplying all business models with digitalization and applications and support them with the ways of working. So, that has been good. And as we announced yesterday, one of them with one governmental agency definitely included that. So, we see the government going the same way as an enterprise market going with digitalization, which includes applications, wireless technology, fiber technology in order to see that their employees and their services have the latest technologies. And that I think we are playing well into, given the network we have and the confidence that everybody have in our network from, so I think that's really what's happening. Matt, on the consumer side? Thank you. First of all, on the different type of value services we have in the high end or in the Premium segment, if it's Disney+ or others, we think that's very important still. And we see our customers really liking it. And we have been in the forefront of this industry with these type of exclusive deals with the most prominent brands you can ever think about. We will continue to do that for our high-end customers. And that has really turned out well for us and our partners. And in \u2013 during the second half of this year as well as we announced at the Investor Day, we also want to launch a Plus Play, which is a platform for digital subscription aggregation for our customers. You have seen basically, I wouldn't say everyone because there is many in the market. But the majority of the important brands has signed up with us. So, we will continue to leverage both sort of network and service but also distribution as a service for our customers and for us in order to have the best return on investment. So, we feel good about that. And as you see in the marketplace, I mean digital subscription services is just popping up direct-to-consumer all over the place, nowhere better to work with than working with Verizon that has the biggest direct-to-consumer distribution in the market. So, we have a lot of inbounds. We are going to do it right. We are going to see that our customers and our shareholders are benefiting from it. When it comes to the question about subsidy and all of that and segmentation, and as clearly articulated, we try to be surgical in our changes, both on prices and on step-ups and all of that. And right now, the team working diligently, has been on the segment that is hitting low-end unlimited and metered plan. We are going to see and have opportunities there to bundle in other things. We are already working with our fixed wireless access offering for our customers that are wireless customers with very good value proposition. So, we will continue that and see if there are other things we need to bundle in. But right now, we have, I think a very strong positioning. And we are taking aggressive actions in the quarter, some confidence that we will continue to see improvements here over time."

            "content": "Thank you, Hans and good morning everyone. As Hans said, this was a challenging quarter and our results did not meet the expectations we have set for ourselves. We have implemented multiple actions to better position Verizon for the future. At the same time, we expect the market environment to continue to be very competitive for the remainder of 2022. Before discussing our expectations for the remainder of the year, let's walk through results from the second quarter, beginning with an overview of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our runway for mobility growth is predicated on driving our customer base into higher value data plans and we continue to make good progress in the second quarter. Premium penetration within our consumer base increased to 39% at quarter end and 57% of new accounts in the quarter selected Premium Unlimited and step-ups within our existing base remained healthy. This activity helped drive a 2.4% year-over-year increase in consumer postpaid ARPA. Our recent administrative fee increase and economic adjustment charge began to show up on customers' bills in the last few days of the second quarter and we expect close to a full quarter's benefit to revenue and ARPA trends in the third quarter, while our metered price changes will be phased in throughout the third quarter, which will provide an additional uplift. We reported postpaid phone net adds of 12,000 in the second quarter as strong business results more than offset softer consumer performance. Business delivered 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand across all lines of the business group, as phone gross adds were up nearly 30% from the same period a year ago and we expect this strong performance to continue. On the consumer side, postpaid phone net losses were 215,000 in the quarter and stemmed from two main drivers. First, churn increased by 10 basis points compared to the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn contributed roughly half of the increase due to the expiration of state consumer protection policies and less stimulus funding. This was coupled with an 11% decline in phone gross adds from the prior year, driven by the competitive offerings in the marketplace. As Hans indicated, we recently introduced a Welcome plan in order to drive demand for more price-conscious consumers, particularly as they make spending adjustments due to the effects of higher inflation. This new plan is well positioned to attract new customers, especially for those who bring their own device. It is our most basic Unlimited offering with no device promotions or many of the other features available in Mix & Match Unlimited to plans. We reserve our most generous acquisition and retention offers for consumers willing to select our Premium Unlimited plans and we believe that opportunities exist to better serve these high-value customers. Upgrade activity remained elevated throughout the quarter, reflecting loyalty within our core customer base, while also serving to drive greater premium adoption. As a result, total postpaid phone activations across consumer and business were up 8% from the same period last year. Let's now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. During the second quarter, we continued to scale and grow our nationwide broadband opportunity with additional expansion of fixed wireless households and businesses covered. In addition, we expanded Fios availability to add additional 150,000 homes during the quarter and are on track to achieve our target of 550,000 incremental homes open for sale in 2022. Total broadband net adds were 268,000 in the quarter, an increase of 39,000 sequentially in what is traditionally a seasonally softer quarter. Fixed wireless momentum accelerated as we added 256,000 subscribers in the quarter, up from 194,000 in 1Q. Fixed wireless net adds have increased every month throughout 2022 and we expect to continue that trend in the third quarter. We also added 36,000 Fios Internet net adds during the second quarter. While Fios Internet churn remains well below pre-pandemic levels, we are seeing softer gross adds due to lower-than-expected switching activity from moves and fewer new home purchases. We recently introduced Fios Mix & Match 3.0 that aligns our Fios and fixed wireless pricing and better positions us to grow joint account penetration. Now, let's talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our integration of TracFone is on track and the team remains focused on enhancing the customer value proposition and delivering cost synergies through migrating off-net customers onto the Verizon network. Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of 227,000 in the second quarter and total Verizon prepaid net losses were 229,000. These results exclude a base adjustment of 402,000 related to a competitor's 3G shutdown. Our prepaid volumes were impacted by aggressive postpaid promotions. As we made progress on our TracFone integration initiatives, we will be better positioned to serve those customers wanting to migrate to postpaid offerings. Our business case had anticipated subscriber losses during the early phase of the integration period, which we expect to continue into the second half of the year. However, should customer preferences shift to the value market and make recessionary concerns we would expect to see some benefits. Prepaid ARPU was $31.26 in the quarter, up modestly on a sequential basis and we expect it to remain stable going forward. Now, let's move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was relatively flat year-over-year, as wireless service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue were offset primarily by wireline declines and the net impact of last year's M&A activity. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.1%, primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, further progress on our Premium Unlimited strategy and strong business volumes. Service and other revenue was down 3.9% for the quarter as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 billion for the quarter, down 2.6% year-over-year due to the divestiture of Verizon Media, higher device subsidies and promotional spending associated with the increased wireless activations, wireline revenue declines and inflationary cost pressures. Regarding inflation, we are seeing the pressures within our cost structure, most notably on labor costs, utilities and transportation and logistics expenses. We expect these pressures to accelerate in the second half of the year and have an impact on profitability and earnings. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.31, down 5.8% from the prior year. This primarily reflects the impact of our adjusted EBITDA results and higher D&A related to our C-Band rollout. Now, let's take a look at our second quarter consumer financial results. Total consumer revenue for the quarter grew 9.1% year-over-year, driven by the inclusion of TracFone, higher equipment revenue, and core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 10.5% year-over-year, also driven by the inclusion of TracFone and postpaid ARPU growth. Total Fios revenue was flat versus the same period a year ago, as internet growth was offset by video and voice declines. Consumer EBITDA was $10.4 billion, down 0.3% compared to the same period last year. Our higher contribution from TracFone was more than offset primarily by higher promotional activity. Consumer EBITDA margin was 40.5% in the quarter. Now, let's take a close look at the business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment's wireless results remained strong in 2Q, while wireline service declines continued amid a softening economy and ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 3.0% was up from 2.1% last quarter. Small and medium business continued its strong momentum, accelerating growth for the second consecutive quarter, while Global Enterprise had its best performance since the first quarter of 2020. Business wireline declines were elevated this quarter, in part due to foreign currency and federal USF, which together impacted growth by more than 300 basis points year-over-year. The secular process from technology migration continued to weigh on legacy voice and data services. And we expect this trend to continue. Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year. In addition to wireline revenue declines, we experienced elevated device subsidies related to the 15% year-over-year increase in wireless activations in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 22.9% in the second quarter. Moving on to Slide 13 on the cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2022 totaled $17.7 billion compared with $20.4 billion in the prior year period. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased inventory levels as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.5 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of $2.8 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $7.2 billion for the first half of the year. We exited the quarter with $130.6 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement of $5 billion, resulting in a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. In a period of rising interest rates, our balance sheet is in a strong position, with less than $2 billion of unsecured bonds maturing in the next 18 months. Lastly, let's move to an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. We now expect wireless service revenue growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%, down from the prior 9% to 10% range. The pricing actions already implemented are expected to contribute approximately $1 billion in the second half of 2022. However, this benefit is expected to be offset by the accounting impact of promotional activity and the impact of lower net adds. As a result of the reduction in wireless service revenue expectations and anticipated ongoing wireline pressures, we now expect service and other revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to flat. We are lowering our adjusted EBITDA growth expectations for the full year to a range of minus 1.5% to flat versus our prior range of 2% to 3%. This revised outlook accounts for higher levels of activations driven by our promotional activity, inflation-driven costs that we discussed previously, the reduction in wireless service revenue and business wireline revenue headwinds. Our guidance assumes Consumer EBITDA margin in 3Q to be similar to margins seen in the first half, with typical seasonality in 4Q. Business EBITDA margins in the second half of 2022 are expected to be in line with those reported in the first half of the year. Finally, we are lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.10 to $5.25 versus the prior $5.40 to $5.55 range. This fee reflects the reduction in adjusted EBITDA as well as incremental cash interest expense versus our expectations at the beginning of the year of about $300 million for the full year compared with the $150 million to $200 million we estimated last quarter, due to updated market expectations for additional Fed fund rate increases. For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business-as-usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion of C-Band-related spending. In closing, we are confident in our strategy and believe that our assets position us well to generate long-term shareholder value. I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to questions. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Hans. And thanks for the question, Brett. So and actually building on your last comment there, Hans, about high-quality customers, Brett, that shows up in the payment patterns we're seeing. We haven't seen any noticeable change in the payment patterns from customers, continues to be very good, very much in line with what we were seeing pre-COVID, in fact, slightly better than that time period. And when you look at the quality of the business we're writing, the FICO scores in our DPP portfolio have never been higher. So at this point in time, we're continuing to see the type of strong payment patterns that you would expect from the high-quality customer base that we have. No, just one thing I'd add to Hans' response, Simon. Certainly, we expect to see significant benefit in the second half of the year from the actions we've taken. I mentioned that in my comments. That's probably about $1 billion of incremental revenue sequentially in the second half versus the first half. I would expect, and we have assumed in our forward view, that we will see a small bubble in churn here in the third quarter as a result of customers as they get those price increases on metered plans or whatever else. But apart from that, we expect to see significant benefit from the actions we've taken. Yes. Hans, maybe the only other thing I'd add on is, Phil, one of the things we've done during the current quarter, we mentioned last time that we've reached an agreement with some of the satellite companies to get early clearing on outside the initial 46 C-Band markets. And in those markets, we're not turning on 60 megahertz, but 100 megahertz of the C-Band. And the difference in the speeds that we're seeing with 100 megahertz versus 60 is exactly in line with what we'd expect. But it tells us that we have a path to a very, very strong network performance. We really like what we're seeing on C-Band today. But when we get the full amount deployed, it's going to be an uptick even further. So we absolutely believe that a network-driven strategy will allow us to continue to perform very well. Hey, Pat, so just maybe one data point for you on fixed wireless. About 30% of our FWA adds, what we would call new, new to Verizon, where we didn't have an existing relationship with them. So obviously, we like the ability of taking an existing Verizon customer and adding a service. But when you bring a completely new customer on the platform, that's pretty exciting as well. So hopefully, that helps your question. Yes. Thanks Dave. So, thank you for the question. So, look, as you think about the guide at the EBITDA level, as you say, there is about $1 billion of revenue sequential uptick. But then the offset to that, you have got the promotional spend that is certainly running at a higher level than we thought at the beginning of the year based off what we are seeing in the marketplace. And we are making the assumption that we are going to see that type of level for the balance of the year that's based in there of the reduction in EBITDA growth from the 2% to 3% down to the minus 1.5% to flat, 75 basis points to 100 basis points of that is coming from inflation and our assumption of that for the full year versus our original plans for the year. On the working capital side, you have got a couple of things playing in there. One is, over the last couple of years, we have had some artificial working capital headwinds caused by COVID as volumes came down. Transaction volumes came down. That gave us some lower EPP balances that was a favor to working capital. We now, of course, see volumes increasing again. And so you have got that reverting to more normal levels, on top of which, moving to 36-month EPP will increase the amount of outstanding balances versus what we saw pre-COVID. So, we will work through a large chunk of that this year. And I would expect to see less of a working capital headwind half of this year, but that's certainly in the \u2013 you will see that in the free cash flow right now. We feel very good about the cash flow generation about the business going forward and what we will achieve as we work through this current period. Hans, I will hand it over to you for the union question. Yes. Hans, maybe just a couple of things. Mike, if you think back pre-COVID, Verizon Business Group had very strong performance. Obviously, COVID was very disruptive to the Business segment. You have seen the recovery in net adds over the past year now be very strong. And you are seeing that show up in the service revenue growth, up to 3% this quarter, up sequentially two quarters in a row now. And we do expect that to continue at a strong pace. And as Hans said, we are not going to comment on multiyear outlook at this point, but certainly feel like the actions that we are taking and have taken and will continue to work on put us on a path to EBITDA growth as we go forward here. So, look forward to, obviously, updating you on that as we get into next year. Yes, Hans, nothing really to add on the margin side. There are obviously a number of apps forward for us. And we will \u2013 we have high expectations for the results we will produce. On the inventory part of your question, we took a decision that, I think was obviously a smart way of approach in the market to say there was more uncertainty around supply chain, both the availability of the physical item and also the supply chain's ability to deliver that item from factory to us in a predictable fashion. And so we have built some cushion into our supply chain model. And you can see that in the inventory levels. There is certainly scope for us as we feel more comfortable about the predictability of the supply chain to return inventory levels closer to historical levels is once you account for the difference in rates of the price of the product. But certainly, absolutely, I would expect to see inventory levels have the opportunity to reduce. Yes. So look, obviously, we \u2013 the team continues to work through the competitive marketplace, as I mentioned earlier. I do expect to see a topple in a little bit of a problem in churn in the third quarter here because of some customer reaction to the pricing actions we have taken. We would expect to compete effectively during the holiday season as we get into new device launches in the fourth quarter. So, I would expect us to start to show up with obviously different numbers at that time of the year. And then we will continue to work to be as competitive on a disciplined fashion in the market as we need to be."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open up for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn over the call to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Angela. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I\u2019m here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.09 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.5 billion. This includes a pretax loss of approximately $1.2 billion from early debt redemption costs. In addition, the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $238 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.35 in the first quarter. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady. Good morning and thanks for joining us for this earnings call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day earlier in March. During the first quarter, the team stayed focused and continued to execute on our Network as a Service strategy. This strategy underpins our five vectors of growth and a diverse path to revenue growth that set us apart and set us up for today and tomorrow. To that end, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we made across our five vectors during the first quarter. We continued to make headway towards our long-term targets and delivered a solid start to the year, even in the phase of competitive and macroeconomic pressures. Matt will go deeper on these topics later on. With that, let\u2019s get into results at the high level. Our first quarter adjusted EPS results of $1.35 proves our ability to execute and deliver profitability. This demonstrates our unique position of having both a focused strategy and strong execution capabilities to meet the needs of our four stakeholders in the growing 5G economy. It all starts with our network expansion and execution. As you\u2019ve heard me say many, many times, mobility, broadband and cloud are the essential pieces of the 21st century\u2019s infrastructure. We\u2019re already taking advantage of this infrastructure and capitalizing on an addressable market that is growing as consumers and businesses adopt 5G. We saw this growth in our wireless sales, our customer loyalty and the rapid expansion of our fixed wireless business in this quarter. Across the business, our wireless activations were up 11% year-over-year and we delivered our best Q1 full net add performance since 2018. Additionally, our fixed wireless started to benefit from the launch of C-Band during the quarter, helping to amplify our national broadband strategy and deliver our highest broadband net adds in over a decade. We continue to deploy C-Band rapidly, enabling more and more of our customers to enjoy our Ultra Wideband experience, while also accelerating and amplifying our 5G revenue opportunities. A strategic pillar in our network expansion is our C-Band build-out, which combined with our continued millimeter wave rollout further establish and strengthens our network leadership with RootMetrics ranking us again as the most reliable 5G network in the United States and we have just started with the C-Band deployment. At the Super Bowl, we demonstrated the power of 5G to deliver new in-stadium and home experiences. For example, fans streaming the halftime show had access to multiple camera angles over our network to fully immerse in the entertainment experience, only something that can be done with 5G Ultra. This is just a taste of the new customer experience we and our partners are beginning to build on 5G Ultra. This is all based on a strong belief in giving our customers maximum optionality like Mix & Match, multi-cloud partners that allow our business customer choice for the digital transformation on 5G mobile edge compute, choice on premium experience with Verizon Up and choices of streaming services with exclusive deals only on Verizon. Just this week, we announced HBO Max will be offered on our +play platform. We\u2019re empowering our customers to choose the services they need and we\u2019re delivering on it. Our disciplined focus is reflected in our first quarter results as we saw continued momentum with step-ups and elevated device upgrades from our customers. As we previously mentioned, as technology megatrends further shift how we will work and live, 2022 is a year for Verizon to scale execution. The world continues to transition toward increased connectivity and the telecommunications industry\u2019s role in building our future has never been more vital. Through our key investments across our portfolio of assets, we will continue to build on our unique competitive position in the industry and drive growth across all of our five vectors. As we said before, 5G adoption is already much faster than what we saw when we changed from 3G to 4G. A year after 4G launched, less than 10% of the users had a compatible device. A year after the launch of 5G Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, about 24% of our customers were on 5G devices. 5G device penetration is significant and we expect it will reach 60% of our wireless consumers by the end of 2023, up from 40% at the end of the first quarter. Let me now talk about the momentum in our Business Group. Verizon Business Group continues to have a very strong momentum in wireless. I\u2019m proud to report that Tami and her team delivered the best quarterly full net adds since we formed Verizon Business Group and they are just getting started. We\u2019re also rapidly building our 5G mobile edge compute and private 5G networks. Verizon was first in the industry to offer MEC services. This quarter, we partnered with Cisco to deliver the low latency connectivity necessary for autonomous vehicles. As a partner of choice across all categories, we also made our first 5G agreement with a premium global automaker, and we will bring 5G connectivity to the next generation of Audi models starting with their 2024 vehicles. This IoT momentum expands across all our verticals with another strong net add performance this quarter. We\u2019re also seeing very promising progress in our private 5G network capabilities, offering small, mid-market and large enterprise clients, turnkey plug-and-play services. I\u2019m also pleased to share that our C-Band launch and aggressive execution, generated nationwide customer enthusiasm for our broadband offerings. Total new broadband customers were the highest in over a decade, with 229,000 net adds driven by a strong increase of 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds. And this is not the one-off. You can see from the current broadband trends that the demand for fixed wireless is extremely high and growing. In the consumer business, we grew postpaid average revenue per account by 2.6% as our users upgraded new 5G packages. ARPA growth is a major part of the strategy that we presented at the Investor Day. In the value market, the TracFone integration continues to unlock an addressable consumer market that we have only just scratched the surface on. We now have the ability to service customers in all segments regardless of the macroeconomic outlook. Manon and I are very encouraged by this opportunity and see tremendous value in the customer base Eduardo and his team have cultivated under the TracFone umbrella. The migration of TracFone subscribers from other networks continues according to plan. In addition to the result in 5G mobility, nationwide broadband, MEC and business to business and the value segment, we also see ongoing momentum in the fifth vector network monetization with growth in volumes driving incremental revenues. Of course, all of this opportunity is built on top of the best network in the industry and the deployment of our 5G Ultra Wideband technology. Kyle and team now have more than 35,000 millimeter wave sites on air and approximately 113 million POPs covered at quarter-end with C-Band. As deployment continues and device penetration ramps, traffic on our Ultra Wideband is increasing rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, 14% of all traffic in urban areas was on 5G Ultra, the result of our combined millimeter wave and mid-band spectrum. We saw a 35% increase in millimeter wave traffic between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. C-Band traffic grew 155% from the end of February to the end of March, where C-Band is deployed, 30% of our wireless traffic uses that spectrum. We have achieved this network evolution in the phase of ongoing supply chain disruption. As I mentioned in previous quarters, our supply chain management is world-class. And we have planned and executed extremely well to anticipate and meet the needs of our customers. We continue to work with our partners with a focus on our deployment targets. We remain diligent in managing a complex global supply chain and count on our expertise to help us to deal with the unexpected. As you come to expect from our technology team, progress is being made throughout our network. In March, we announced a major milestone in the advancement of our 5G network as we work with two satellite companies to secure early clearing of an additional 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in 30 additional markets. Rolling out our C-Band service on this spectrum will expand our 5G market by 40 million potential customers, a full year ahead of schedule. We expect to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of 2022 on C-Band. Early spectrum clearance gives us the speed to market and accelerates the return on capital for our network investments. Having early access to these 30 major markets will support our entire business. It adds consumers and business to our addressable market. And we know from experience that we see customer interest for fixed wireless access as soon as it is available. Our network expansion also supports our mission of digital inclusion, which is key to how we serve our four stakeholders and execute our strategy according to responsible business practices. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. Today, we released our detailed environmental, social and governance report for 2021, and we are proud of our progress. The report covers our ESG strategy in detail and reflects how responsible business practices drive our business. During the first quarter, we completed allocating proceeds from our third green bond offering and issued our fourth $1 billion green bond, which is expected to be allocated towards renewable energy. We also continue to pursue long-term carbon footprint goals as described in previous quarters and in our ESG report. Third quarters have taken notice. We continue to be recognized for our sustainability efforts. During the quarter, MSCI raised our ESG rating to AA, our highest rating to date. And Sustainalytics ranked us strong in ESG risk management and low in overall ESG risk, putting us above our U.S. telecom competitors. As always, what it means to be responsible business depends on global conditions. I\u2019m proud of Verizon\u2019s relief efforts to support Ukraine, including extending free calling to and from Ukraine since the start of the war. Taken together, Verizon remains well positioned to compete this year. Our first quarter performance puts us on track for this pivotal investment year, and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term growth targets. Now I will hand the call over to Matt to address our results in detail, as well as some updates on the 2022 guidance.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last month, we talked about 2022 as a critical year for scaling the business and making investments to position Verizon for the long-term. And this quarter, we may progress along that path. At that event, we said we expect to generate an incremental $14 billion of service and other revenue from the business by 2025, and that we expect to get there through leveraging our unique collection of assets against our five growth vectors. We expect over 75% of our growth over the next four years will come from 5G mobility and nationwide broadband. And our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our growth prospects. Our consumer and business units will measure success in mobility by how we perform in the areas of ARPA, premium unlimited penetration and subscribers and accounts. We\u2019ve talked about our plans for increasing the value of our existing base of wireless customers through step up to higher value data plans. The first quarter saw us achieve an increase in consumer postpaid ARPA of 2.6% year-over-year, positioning us for high quality revenue and earnings growth going forward. 64% of new accounts selected premium unlimited, and together with continued step-up momentum drove our premium penetration up to 36%. With respect to subscribers and new accounts, for the first quarter, we reported postpaid phone net losses of 36,000, which represents an improvement of 142,000 or 80% from a year ago and our best first quarter performance since 2018. The performance was driven by our business team, which contributed a record 256,000 phone net adds, the highest from the unit since Verizon 2.0 reporting began. These results were driven by strength in the three wireless customer groups as SMB, Enterprise, and Public Sector, each delivered double digit phone gross ad growth and extended the momentum built in the second half of last year. We expect this strong performance to continue as we approach something closer to a pre pandemic environment. On the Consumer side phone net losses were 292,000 in the quarter. While churn was study, we saw a decline in phone gross adds of 2% from the prior year. This gross add trend was more pronounced in March and is continuing into April. We will continue to take appropriate measures to be competitive in the market. We are pleased with the quality of the business that we are writing and are confident in the value of the postpaid phone gross adds we are attracting. Our retail postpaid accounts at the end of Q1 across Consumer and Business are up 40,000 from last year. Consumer and Business segment performance in the nationwide broadband vector was strong and demonstrates the opportunity to scale this business. We measure our success against this vector by households and businesses covered by broadband and the total subscribers on our networks. As Hans mentioned, the early clearance spectrum announcement is a major milestone for Verizon. Our network team is now able to deploy this spectrum a full year sooner than expected unlocking another 40 million of addressable population. We feel confident that our C-Band network will cover at least 175 million POPs by the end of this year, and will cover 50 million household and 14 million businesses with fixed wireless access by the end of 2025. The addressable opportunity expansion continues in Fios as well with 115,000 incremental open for sale in the quarter. We are seeing strong uptake in our broadband offers, and we expect increasing momentum as more and more people get access to our 5G Ultra Wideband and find service throughout the year. We had 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds across the portfolio, which is 2.5 times our 4Q 2021 performance. Consumers continue to see the benefit of the speed, reliability, and simplicity of installation of the FWA product. And businesses continue to recognize that FWA can be a primary broadband access solution for all of their needs. The total broadband, we registered 229,000 net ads representing our highest net ads in over a decade. Fios Internet contributed 60,000 net ads within the quarter, driven by record low levels of churn. Now let\u2019s move on to the MEC & B2B solutions vector. Tami and the team continue to make great progress in this space. Within IoT, the team delivered another strong quarter of connection growth. We\u2019re seeing success across our verticals, working with our customers to deliver the solutions that they need. As we mentioned during our Investor Day, we anticipate that connections will continue to grow at a double-digit pace. With our investments and key partnerships, we continue to expand the ecosystem for MEC, as well as advance our deployments in private wireless and private MEC. Our market differentiation is unmatched in terms of scale and capabilities. And we are well positioned to accelerate our long-term revenue growth within this space. Now, let\u2019s talk about the value market. Q1 marks a first full quarter of TracFone included in our consumer results. Our integration of TracFone is going as planned, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. We measure our success in the value market based on prepaid ARPU, prepaid subscribers, and prepaid revenue. Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of our prepaid brands. This declined in part because TracFone ARPU is lower than our legacy Verizon prepaid ARPU. Additionally, we saw quarter-over-quarter pressure specifically in the TracFone brands in part due to the transition from the Emergency Broadband Benefit program to the affordable connectivity program, which negatively impacted ARPUs benefits dropped from $50 to $30. Going forward, we expect prepaid ARPU to stabilize and subsequently grow as we execute in our strategy to bring additional value to this space. While we experience certain device inventory pressure throughout the quarter, especially in January, the team finished strong and delivered first quarter volumes in TracFone that compare favorably to of prior years, excluding 2021 activity, which benefited from stimulus programs. Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of $77,000, while total Verizon prepaid net losses in the quarter were $80,000. Next let\u2019s move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 14. On a consolidated basis, Verizon delivered strong wireless service revenue growth in a highly competitive environment in the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.5%, reflecting the first full quarter of TracFone ownership, as well as continued execution of our Network-as-a-Service strategy and contributions from our five vectors of growth. Service and other revenue was down 2.5% in the quarter, as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, service and other revenue was up 4.2% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.0 billion in for the quarter down year-over-year by 1.1% do in part to elevated marketing expenses. We introduced our 5G Ultra Campaign at the beginning of the year to support our C-Band launch and FWA expansion. Combined with lower spending on the first quarter of 2021 driven by COVID-related impacts on our operations, marketing expenses represented a year-over-year drag on first quarter EBITDA growth. Other items impacting Q1 EBITDA including the disposition of Verizon Media, which had EBITDA levels above those that TracFone added in the quarter, especially considering the investment we\u2019re starting to put into the TracFone brands. We expect marketing expenses to return to more normal levels in Q2. And we will begin to lap the prior year ramp up in tower expenses, which also represented a year-over-year pressure in Q1. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was a $1.35, relatively in line with prior year. The bottom-line performance shows the strength of our core business to deliver profitability, even in a period of significant investment, as well as other headwinds. Now let\u2019s take a look at our Consumer financial results in Q1. Total Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9% year-over-year, driven by first full quarter of TracFone inclusion, higher equipment revenue, and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 11.2% year-over-year. These results were driven by the inclusion of TracFone as well as our increase in postpaid ARPA, which was driven by the strong step-up momentum I discussed earlier and growth within our non-connectivity products and services. Moving to File Services, we continue to see volume and rate gains with broadband of setting pressures from video and voice as total files revenue grew 1.8%. Consumer EBITDA was $10.5 billion up year-over-year by 1.0%. This growth is a result of the inclusion TracFone as well as ARPA and customer volume gains, partially offset by the items mentioned earlier, such as higher marketing expenses, investments in TracFone and higher bad debt, driven mainly by higher sales volumes in the quarter. Similarly, the higher sales activity resulted in elevated equipment revenue, pressuring EBITDA margins, which were 41.4% in the quarter. Margins were additionally pressured by the inclusion of the results of TracFone, which is a business that has historically operated with margins below the legacy consumer business. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the business financial results on Slide 16. The Verizon Business Group continues to see strong wireless sales and service momentum within the business space, alongside the ongoing wireline service declines. Wireless service revenue growth of 2.1% was led by momentum in our SMB Group, which continues to see strong post-pandemic recovery. The rate of growth is an improvement from last quarter\u2019s 1.5% and with 1Q last year representing the peak for distance learning devices, we expect Business wireless service revenue growth to expand over the rest of 2022. Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 9.3% from the prior year. The decline in EBITDA was driven in part by the ongoing reduction in high margin wireline revenue. Additionally, we experienced elevated levels of subsidy related to the strong wireless Q1 sales volume, which were up 20% year-over-year. EBITDA margin was 22.5%, similarly impacted by wireline service trends and wireless sales volumes. Let\u2019s move to Slide 17, the cashflow summary. Cashflow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion, compared with $9.7 billion from the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted receivables and inventory increased as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. Capital spending for the first quarter, totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion. The continued build out of OneFiber and our investment to support growth of traffic on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network great extends our opportunity to effectively compete in all of our businesses. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $1.0 billion. We exited the quarter with $135.6 billion of net unsecured debt, an increase of $1.9 billion sequentially as we issued our fourth Green Bond, with the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, we completed a number of other transactions during the quarter the proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost, long-term debt. We ended the quarter with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8 times flat on a sequential basis as expected. Lastly, let\u2019s move to guidance to the remainder of the year. I want to provide some additional detail around our view of the macro environment in which we operate and give context around our guidance for 2022. We saw inflationary pressures building towards the end of the first quarter and expect those to continue given the current environment. The major areas of exposure for us at energy related costs for our network operations and transportation, as well as labor related costs, including both our direct workforce and third parties. While these items have not had a significant impact on our overall results to date, they represent a meaningful portion of our direct cost structure and have the potential to drive additional expense pressure throughout the rest of the year. We also believe that the inflation we are seeing throughout the economy may alter both the consumer and business landscaping, which we compete. It is too early to predict how this change landscape may impact our near-term results or how long it will last. But we are confident that the strategy we have put in place will allow us to achieve our long-term growth plans. There\u2019s also been a significant increase in treasury yields recently, but as a reminder, the vast majority of our debt approximately 75% to 80% is fixed rate. The team has kept near-term maturities in the next 12 months to 24 months at manageable levels, which also helps minimize near-term interest rate exposure. If the present forecast of Fed rate hikes are accurate, we anticipate an incremental cash interest impact for the year above our early expectations of $150 million to $200 million. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. On the revenue side, we now anticipate service and other revenue to be approximately flat to 2021, significant items affecting our service and other revenue include USF rate reductions, which are pressuring year-over-year revenue by several hundred million and softness in wireline sales. We are keeping the guidance ranges of wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Based upon our expectations around service and other revenue as well as the macro economic pressures, we now expect to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance ranges for these items. For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business as usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion to see band related spending. We will continue to invest in the business and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities discussed during our Investor Day. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Hans to close out our 2022 priorities.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. Our priority about 2022 is to continue to execute on our Network as a Service strategy and to drive growth across all our five vectors. This is a critical year for scaling on our strategic investment as we work to capture all of the promise that 5G offers both from a customer experience perspective and for a future revenue growth. We made good progress in this quarter and continue to execute on our long-term plans. Our core business and our strategy showed strength and we have a solid momentum going into the second quarter, all built on the strong confidence in our strategy. Now we\u2019re ready to take your questions. Back to you Brady.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Angela, we\u2019re ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. I guess two quick follow-ups to all the data you guys provided. First of all on the EBB reimbursements, is the impact to ARPU that we saw the $5 change, is that fully reflect the changes in reimbursements? And is there any impact from a customer standpoint? And then on consumer margins, they were down 400 basis points. Is that \u2013 can you separate out the impact from TracFone had and sort of underlying trends and what was driving that and just your outlook for the how it actually trend through the year? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Hey, John, so good morning. Thanks for the questions. On the EEB messaging there, there\u2019s certainly - we\u2019re seeing that change in the programs as we go forward here, but no major impact on customer volumes related to that. I think your bigger question on Verizon Consumer Group and the margins we saw in the quarter. So a couple of major things in there, certainly some one-time increases in costs as we look at the quarter. We were very, very strong on our marketing spend this quarter with the launch of C-Band, new price plans, launch of fixed wireless on C-Band as well and everything around that. So that\u2019s in the quarter we would expect that to be returned to more normal levels as we head here into second quarter and go forward. And then of course, you saw the volumes up year-over-year that has some impact in there, and then Trac I mentioned in my prepared remarks so that has an impact. Initially that\u2019s going to be in the 100 basis point to 200 basis point range impact as you bring Trac into the overall VCG mix. And then as we work through the integration and bring all of the customers in Trac onto our network that impact will lessen as we complete the integration over the next 12 months to 24 months. So combination of things in there, but certainly would expect to see a little bit of a slight uptake as we head into the rest of the year here on the \u2013 our consumer margin.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, John. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Yes, thank you for taking the question. So during your prepared remarks, I think you had noted that postpaid phone gross adds had started to soften towards the end of the quarter, and that had continued into 2Q. I was hoping you could let us know what insights you\u2019ve gained into what\u2019s behind that. In other words, to what extent do you think it has to do with lower market volumes or perhaps a shift in porting ratios and some of the steps that you\u2019re going to be implementing to sort of stabilize that. And then just on the cash flow, Matt, to what extent was the higher working capital use in the first quarter really a timing issue, obviously, pre-buying inventory to manage the supply chain seems like a timing factor. But I guess with regards to just the elevated volumes, do you expect to ultimately have that offset either by selling off the receivables or just collecting the payments? Or was any of that actually associated with maybe a little bit more of a device promotion profile in the first quarter? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I\u2019ll start, Brett, and then Matt will support later on there. First of all, I mean if you look at the quarter, we had a very good wireless net adds quarter of course because if you look over the combination, our business side was very strong. Consumer also had a good quarter, but a little bit slowness as we said in the prepared remarks in March. However, if you think about it, it\u2019s logical. I mean the competition is higher as we\u2019ve seen now for a while, because we\u2019re coming into the second phase of the 5G era and acquisition of 5G customers or sort of an important piece in the market. And what we see is of course, a really good traction for us. I mean our share levels are still very low. We\u2019re doing well. We\u2019re doing upgrades and step ups all the time. So - and that\u2019s our focus, then of course, as we always say, we look into the market and we will take measured actions if it\u2019s needed. That\u2019s we\u2019ve done all the time and being very financially disciplined when we come into the market with the offerings and see if there\u2019s something we need to do. But right now I feel really good where we are. We\u2019re actually with our launch, our Ultra in the beginning of the year, it\u2019s really kept made us in a total different situation because our network is just fantastic. And that\u2019s what we see from our customers, both on fixed wireless access and both on consumer and business. And this was the whole strategy we laid out. And when we met in the beginning of March, when it comes to our overall long-term strategy, so now I\u2019m pleased what I see then is going to there be competitive market, but that\u2019s how it is and I think it\u2019s very logical and partly we are sort of coming out with so strong offerings, mix and match and all of that, so the market responding to it. So, yes, I feel good about the strategy.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. And Brett, your question on cash flows, you \u2013 in your question, you used to phrase it a timing factor in here, and I think absolutely that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re seeing. So couple of things on the receivable side with the last couple of years, we actually had some tailwinds associated with some of the impacts of the lower volumes that came through as we went through the pandemic. And now we\u2019re seeing those volumes return to more normal levels, which creates a temporary headwind, but it\u2019s really just getting back to where we were. You think about device payment levels, those are certainly up year-over-year. As we said, activations were up in the quarter 11%. Therefore, we\u2019ve more device loans on the balance sheet, but it\u2019s really getting back to those pre-pandemic levels rather than anything else. We saw an actual benefit in core customer payments that helped the year ago number with all the subsidy money out there. That was a one-time benefit that we\u2019re lapping. Customer payments continue to be incredibly strong. So we\u2019re very pleased with that. And then the inventory side, as we\u2019ve managed through some of the disruptions that we\u2019ve seen there, we\u2019ve taken advantage of the balance sheet strength we have to run it higher the normal inventory levels. But obviously, I would be looking to have us return to more normal levels on that over time here. So I expect those to be just timing factors as you said in your question and continues to be very competent in the overall strengths of the cash flows that this business produces.\nBrett Feldman: Can I say a quick follow-up question on the building at the inventory levels? I guess I just assumed that that was mobile devices. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s correct. And then just in general, how much of extra lead time have you given yourself based on the current inventory levels versus what you would typically manage towards?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. There\u2019s certainly a little bit of an increase in, it is largely what you see in the inventory side of the balance sheet there coming from handsets and so on. So there is a little bit more cushion in there in the system so to speak, which we think is appropriate given the environment that everyone\u2019s operating in. But it\u2019s certainly something that we have \u2013 we think gives us a good position in the marketplace and as supply chains become more predictable again going forward, we\u2019ll adjust that accordingly.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Brett. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey, sorry. I want to follow-up on the last question around the sort of wireless industry and gross adds softness in March and April. So you\u2019ve ramped up your wireless promotions for consumer, which looks more like addressing a churn issue, which I don\u2019t think is what you were calling out. Do you think that software gross adds is a share issue or is that an industry slowdown issue? And then second sort of related how does that impact your thoughts on inflation? And it sounds like AT&T is trying to signal prices higher. How do you think about the potential of this industry to be raising prices at the margin for consumers if we do see inflation starting to creep up? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Phil. I\u2019ll start with overall macro and maybe Matt will fill in a little bit about the gross adds or the question you had. On the inflation, I mean as Matt said in a prepared remarks, I mean we haven\u2019t seen so much impact so far of it. But of course, this is the high in 40 years of an inflation. So we are planning for all scenarios. We have plans to be prepared for what it takes. So that will of course include different type of cost adjustments, but also looking into what we can do with pricing. But again, we don\u2019t know how this will impact us, but clearly these levels of inflation we have never seen before in the wireless industry. So of course, that also the measurements needs to be thought through in a good way and we are doing that and we have already plans ready for it. So we are going to see what\u2019s going to happen. But clearly, we are in a moment in the economy where we really don\u2019t know how this is going to impact finally. But the levels are, of course, very high when it comes to inflation. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Phil, so your question around just what we\u2019re seeing there. Look, I would tell you that there is nothing that we see in the data that suggests any change in share out there. Certainly believe there has been a bit of a down tick in overall foot traffic, not just in our stores, but up and down the high street. But our share continues to be where we would expect it to be. Our churn continues to be very strong and that\u2019s always a good indicator of if we are competing effectively and clearly with the churn at these levels versus historical levels, we feel very good about that. So overall continuing to get our fair share and we expect to continue to do so.\nPhilip Cusick: Great. Okay. Thanks\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Phil. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: All right. Thank you very much. I wonder if we could talk about fixed wireless. Earlier in the quarter, you\u2019ve talked about doubling your Q4 numbers and you came in well ahead of that. I think you talked about wherever you open it up there\u2019s some strong demand. So perhaps just give us some colors. Has the ads been accelerating through the quarter? So is this a good jumping off point for Q2 for the rest of the year. And maybe just address you still got that $25 price point out? How are we thinking about \u2013 how long that lasts and what the footprint is today and what it\u2019s going to be once you\u2019d light up some of those more markets by the end of the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Simon. No, no, this is of course one of the five vectors of growth that we are very focused on and clearly you\u2019ll see the momentum growing for us even since we met in the beginning of March. So clearly, as we turn on more and more houses and businesses for sale, we have a good sale too, and the quarter was of course good for us. And we\u2019re coming in with the momentum into the next quarter is really good. Then, of course, as we say, we\u2019re now deploying sort of the C-Band in urban and suburban, millimeter wave is in urban, LTE is in rural. So that is really now also where the customers are coming onto. But clearly, C-Band is coming quicker in here, we only have even more opportunities. And as you heard me saying in my prepared remarks, we now also have an additional 30 markets that we\u2019ll have early clearing on this year, which gives us even more frequency is 100 megahertz. So this is adding all to this momentum we have. And remember, we have been working on this for a while. We know how to do it all the way from the sort of provision of the network capacity management, building and propositions. And that comes through the pricing as well. I think we have a good pricing at the moment with a combined offering and also the standalone offering. And we see that\u2019s making a good sort of wave in the market. But as always \u2013 we will always look into what is the right price point, which is the right type of value we\u2019re giving our customers. I think we\u2019re giving a great value and that\u2019s what we see in the numbers. So yes, we have a great momentum coming out from the quarter going into this quarter and we will continue to hammer this as we\u2019re having all the five vectors of growth constantly to see that we are reaching our long-term ambitions that we outline in the beginning of this orbit. In the beginning of March, I think that was our Investor Day wasn\u2019t time ago.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So just a couple of things add on there. So Simon, as you think about the volumes we had in the first quarter, remember, that\u2019s not a full quarter of C-Band. That came on in middle of January. And of course, you have that time period where the sales teams are building up the sales motion of selling a new product. So certainly think that we can continue to see good numbers there as we go through the rest of the year. And we\u2019re just getting started with what you saw the 194,000 in the first quarter. And from a pricing standpoint, as Hans said, it\u2019s \u2013 you should think about it that price point you mentioned is for a customer, who\u2019s also taking wireless products from us as well. On a standalone basis, it\u2019s higher price, but we\u2019ll continue to look at the pricing proposition and maximize both the value for customers, but also the opportunity for us as well.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question,\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thank you so much for taking the questions. I guess, my first question would be with respect to fixed wireless access. If we look at your numbers and the numbers, the T-Mobile\u2019s preannounced. It feels like fixed wireless access is going to be more than half the normal broadband net ads in a quarter in a normal year. And that has to be putting some pressure on the cable industry to respond unless there\u2019s a reason or an escape valve that exists because of maybe the affordability connectivity program or something. So I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about how you think the wireline broadband dynamic is going to evolve with cable and how they respond potentially in the wireless market. And the second would be a question if I could maybe Hans, there was a time when Verizon had the best network and charged the highest prices and took the most market share. And on these kinds of calls, we would talk about whether the question was really whether we wanted to give a little margin or take a little market share. You guys are now the share donor on every quarter. And we\u2019re celebrating how many 5G phones we have and how much C-Band we\u2019re deploying. But it\u2019s not obvious that\u2019s translating into something tangible that investors can celebrate in terms of financial reward. So can we talk a little bit about that too? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. We start with the fixed wireless access, I mean I can talk for ourselves and I\u2019m not sure what the response will be from someone. But this is a high quality product. The usage of the fixed wireless access is very similar to our Fios users. So this is a primary usage in the vast minority of all the cases when comes to our fixed wireless access. So this is a high quality product that definitely going to compete very well in the market. And in our case, as we said before, this means that we are nationwide with our broadband as we\u2019re expanding our C-Band and can be address more and more households. That doesn\u2019t mean that we also focus on our Fios footprint, because that is a very strong product in the ILEC we have. And you saw this quarter, again, we\u2019re doing well and continue to grow our Fios. And this year, we\u2019re going to have more open for sale on the Fios. So for us, as we create optionalities, but we only create high quality products that we believe that the customer wants and then that we are supporting. So that\u2019s why I feel good about our whole national broadband strategy that we laid out in the first quarter. So I\u2019m really pleased with that. The second question, I think that when we look at our business and I think we talked very well about at our Investor Day. Our focus is to over time grow this business with 4% and that we do with different levers and of course, based on the best network in the nation, no doubt about that. And our network is just improving and we have just started our C-Band. So we are super excited over the network we have. And then on top of that, of course, the different type of investments we have done in order to grow and to go to 4%. And that I think shareholders should be excited over. And that\u2019s what you see in this quarter as well. We are actually executing on those levers. We are ahead of plan on certain on the vectors, which is great to see and that will translate both the top line and the bottom line as we outline in our Investor Day. So that\u2019s how I see it. And we will continue to see that we are a premium brand, but remember, nowadays we can actually play in all fields on a wireless all the way from the sort of the prepaid to the high end premium and meet any type of conditions in the market with our portfolio, which is enormous strength. And on top of that, we have a scale of economy on all our offerings, because we own our network, we have built our network and all of that. So I feel really good where we have to say and where we\u2019re going and we\u2019re going compete well. I mean, I just can tell you that we feel good about it. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: If I just had one comment onto Hans\u2019 last piece there, while certainly we always want to find a higher gear and never happy with a result, I think we can do better next year. The phone ads was 142,000 battery in 1Q this year than last year. So you see us continuing to make progress there.\nDavid Barden: Thank you so much.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Two questions. First, just curious if you\u2019re seeing different performance of gross ads, handset upgrades, and rate plan mix. When you look at your C-Band markets and your non-C-Band markets and maybe you can unpack some of that difference if there is any. And then secondly, just going back to some of the comments around guidance and you mentioned some of the possible sensitivities to the operating environment. But I was curious if you could be more specific, when you describe lower end of the ranges for wireless service revenue growth, EBITDA and EPS, what specifically is in each of those updated levels of guidance commentary. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the C-Band. Yeah, for obvious reasons, we see more excitement in the markets where we\u2019re turn on the C-Band and also some more upgrades. But remember, we are used in the beginning of the C-Band and we started within the mid basically of the quarter. So we\u2019re there in the beginning, but clearly when our customers and consumers see the C-Band turn on this year enormous performance on the network and that is just make a big difference over time. So far, maybe not so much, but clearly the excitement is out there.\nMatt Ellis: On the guidance, Mike, so as you think through it, in terms of the lower end of range on wireless service revenue. Part of that is obviously as we see the nature of the competitive environment, but it\u2019s also the volumes that you see us delivering and some of the impacts of that. So excited by 11% increase in activations year-over-year that shows strong interest from our customers, but that of course does mean that we see the amortization impact from promo come through the wireless service revenue and so we\u2019ll see that impact there. That of course will also impact the EBITDA guidance, but EBITDA guidance also has our views on inflation as well as we think about the year as a whole and certainly those views have evolved over the has 90 days for everyone as well. And then so obviously EBITDA impacts the EPS guidance and the EPS also has the interest expense that I commented on in my prepared remarks that it\u2019s probably the low-single digit impact on an EPS basis that obviously come through as a result of higher Fed hikes and was probably in people\u2019s plans at the start of the year. So a number of factors impact in each of those items. We still feel very confident in the results of the business we\u2019ll produce this year and the momentum that we\u2019re building in the year across the growth vectors to deliver the long-term aspirations that we all have.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. It\u2019s helpful.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Mike. Angela, ready for the next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Yes. So if I think about the wireless business as kind of the, the traditional P times Q where at the moment you\u2019re not growing either subscribers or ARPU in the traditional sense for phone. How much is your guidance dependent on revenue growth outside of that P times Q? I\u2019m thinking in particular about private network and mobile edge comput; you\u2019ve talked a lot about the new 5G revenue streams. How much are we actually going see that in the current year? And how much does it contribute to your forecast?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks Craig. So as you think about it, so when you look at the P times Q that you mentioned, we got ARPU up to 2.6% on the postpaid side. So certainly see a continuation of executing on the strategy. We\u2019ve talked about of stepping customers up, getting more customers on premium plans. The team continues to do a good job there and you see that in the, a side. You also see as we mentioned an increase in the number of accounts on wireless year-over-year, 40,000 more accounts this year than this time a year ago. So the P times Q there works, but this comes back to what we talked about at the Investor Day, having five vectors of growth and really what we talked about there is just one of them. In addition to that, obviously we\u2019ve got fixed wireless access kicking in now, 194,000 net ads in the first quarter, over 400,000 in the base that\u2019s exactly in line with what we said you should see with increasing the base this year and therefore that having a more meaningful impact on revenue in 2023, but we\u2019re building that base now in line with what we said. And then you laid out the things like MEC and obviously on that not just within the B2B space, mobile edge compute but also as we get into the 5G world. The scope of opportunity for IoT, a machine to machine continues to increase, and we talked about the momentum we have there, and that\u2019s just really getting started. On the prepaid side we continue to see that the integration of TracFone going as expected and we expect that to add value as we go forward here, and then we continue to see growth in our network monetization vector too. So we still feel very confident that we have the ability to grow across more vectors than other people that starts with mobility and extends into the other one, but absolutely think you\u2019ll see growth across all of those. Hans?\nHans Vestberg: No, I think that adding on the mobile edge compute, and we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks, but clearly we see the market now with the whole ecosystem coming in there. And we as the pioneer and the leader in the market definitely have more engagement that we had before. People think little bit to private networks in the beginning 5G private networks and then you build on the mobile edge compute on that. So now I see this as a traditional B2B and not only that it\u2019s definitely clearly a way for us to build new relationship with our enterprise customer. But I said before this year we are building that funnel, we\u2019re making it, and of course when come to meaningful revenue, a little bit higher that\u2019s going to be more next year. So, but clearly this year we\u2019re going to talk a lot about and show you what we\u2019re doing, the solutions we have and remember also we have the smaller solution for SMBs when it comes to private 5G networks. We see so many use cases, and remember all is built on how we built the network from the beginning where we basic from the data center to the edge of the network, have one unified network which is fibered. And then at the edge of the network, we can do different solution for different type of customer groups. This is going to pay off big time the next five to 10 years and I feel really good about how we built the network and seeing also the importance of mobility broadband and cloud in our society for businesses and people. I think we\u2019re so well placed in this, so I feel good about it.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Craig.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Hey, Angela, ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. I\u2019m just curious on the long-term ambition to build out C-Band that your Phase 1 and Phase 2 is pretty clear through 230 million POPs. Is there attractive returns building out C-Band beyond that? Is there a Phase 3 and what\u2019s the timeframe for that? Just trying to get a line of sight on the long-term capital intensity? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, it is more \u2013 more ambition to continue. When it comes to capital intensity, I think we outlined that very clearly that we will have the peak year now, then we\u2019re coming down. And then in 2024, 2025 we will have a BAU that is below 12%, which is of course over a decade, the lowest we\u2019ve had, but that is coming from the investment levels we have done and prepared the network. In there of course we have the BAU expansion on C-Band, so that\u2019s clear and already right now as you know, we have moved up. So now we will have doing at least 175 million POPs covered this year. And then of course that means also that other pieces of the network will come earlier and topping that with so far, we\u2019re only using 60 megahertz, now we\u2019re adding 100 megahertz in the next 30 markets. But remember in average we 161 megahertz nationwide and in many and mostly in the rural areas, we\u2019re up to 200 megahertz. So of course we invested in this spectrum in order to be extremely competitive and do things that nobody else can do. So we going to continue to do it, but that doesn\u2019t change the profile that Matt and I laid out when it comes to capital intensity. That\u2019s included, but clearly we\u2019re going to take advantage of the investments we\u2019ve done and the sooner we do it, the better it is.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So Doug, just add onto that a little bit. If you think about network usage and customers demand on the network continues to grow year-over-year that\u2019s true across every geography. So you should expect no difference in how we think out C-Band rollout to get 5G Ultra Wideband to all of our customers, the same way we did with LTE rollout a decade ago. And as you saw with the LTE rollout, as we got out of the initial launch areas to more nationwide, we did that within our overall CapEx envelope and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve described that you should expect from us as we do the same thing with C-Band and get the 5G experience to all of our customers as soon as possible here.\nDoug Mitchelson: All right. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Great. Thanks, Doug. Angela, we\u2019ve got time for one more question. Can we do the last question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Your last question comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I guess first I wanted to ask you if you\u2019ve seen any change in the composition of your postpaid phone, gross ad mix over the past few quarters in terms of different segments of the market both in consumer and business. And that more recently you talked about the softness in March and April. Are there any pockets of strength or weakness that you would call out underneath of that overall pressure you\u2019ve been seeing in March and April? Or is it pretty broad based? And then separately, I just wanted to ask you a follow up on Fios. I think you\u2019ve got to a 550,000 increase in Fios premises past this year. Are you giving any consideration to accelerating that pace over the next few years, given what seemed to be improving economics for fiber broadband across the industry? Or do you think that fixed wireless is just a better way to approach the vast majority of your ILEC footprint that hasn\u2019t been upgraded to Fios? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the second one because I remember it, and I will come to the wireless customers. So on the Fios you\u2019re right, 550,000 open for sale this year, which is an increase from 2021. And we will continue to look for opportunities to expand as our customers are allowing the product. So there are no limitation on that. That\u2019s of course of the focus is in the ILEC when we\u2019re doing the expansion outside that we \u2013 we predominantly working with fixed wise access. So ultimately we want to give high quality products on broadband that can be used for everything you need in a home or in a business and that\u2019s what we\u2019re catering for either to fixed wireless access on Fios. So we going to continue to see if we accelerate depending on customer demands, but clearly as we\u2019re increasing Fios this year compared to last year, we see that happening, and our capture rate on Fios is of course magnificent, it\u2019s great. We\u2019re really strong on it. When it comes to the wireless customers and I guess I don\u2019t 100% remember the questions, so Matt will probably support me at the end there. But one thing that we need to remember the strength of a SMB, for example, that we\u2019ve had now for many quarters that is a clearly a segment that is doing when on wireless, then on the same time as Matthew said, we see our customers continue to do upgrade and step ups. That is part of our strategy and that we\u2019re seeing in our base constantly. So I don\u2019t think that is a big difference from previous quarters we\u2019ve seen before, but I\u2019m not sure maybe Matthew have something more than that.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So on the comments about March and April volumes, those are predominantly on the consumer side, nothing particular in terms of breaking the consumer apart there in terms of particular areas. But as Hans said the VBG site, Verizon Business Group continues to do very strong performance across small business, enterprise, public sector, double-digit growth and gross ads across each of those parts of Tami\u2019s business in the first quarter. And that really fairly even throughout the quarter. So we saw a little lower foot traffic on the consumer side, but the business side continues to perform at a fairly even level throughout the quarter and as we head into Q2 here.\nBryan Kraft: Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Angela, we\u2019re ready to finish the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady. Good morning and thanks for joining us for this earnings call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day earlier in March. During the first quarter, the team stayed focused and continued to execute on our Network as a Service strategy. This strategy underpins our five vectors of growth and a diverse path to revenue growth that set us apart and set us up for today and tomorrow. To that end, I'm pleased with the progress we made across our five vectors during the first quarter. We continued to make headway towards our long-term targets and delivered a solid start to the year, even in the phase of competitive and macroeconomic pressures. Matt will go deeper on these topics later on. With that, let's get into results at the high level. Our first quarter adjusted EPS results of $1.35 proves our ability to execute and deliver profitability. This demonstrates our unique position of having both a focused strategy and strong execution capabilities to meet the needs of our four stakeholders in the growing 5G economy. It all starts with our network expansion and execution. As you've heard me say many, many times, mobility, broadband and cloud are the essential pieces of the 21st century's infrastructure. We're already taking advantage of this infrastructure and capitalizing on an addressable market that is growing as consumers and businesses adopt 5G. We saw this growth in our wireless sales, our customer loyalty and the rapid expansion of our fixed wireless business in this quarter. Across the business, our wireless activations were up 11% year-over-year and we delivered our best Q1 full net add performance since 2018. Additionally, our fixed wireless started to benefit from the launch of C-Band during the quarter, helping to amplify our national broadband strategy and deliver our highest broadband net adds in over a decade. We continue to deploy C-Band rapidly, enabling more and more of our customers to enjoy our Ultra Wideband experience, while also accelerating and amplifying our 5G revenue opportunities. A strategic pillar in our network expansion is our C-Band build-out, which combined with our continued millimeter wave rollout further establish and strengthens our network leadership with RootMetrics ranking us again as the most reliable 5G network in the United States and we have just started with the C-Band deployment. At the Super Bowl, we demonstrated the power of 5G to deliver new in-stadium and home experiences. For example, fans streaming the halftime show had access to multiple camera angles over our network to fully immerse in the entertainment experience, only something that can be done with 5G Ultra. This is just a taste of the new customer experience we and our partners are beginning to build on 5G Ultra. This is all based on a strong belief in giving our customers maximum optionality like Mix & Match, multi-cloud partners that allow our business customer choice for the digital transformation on 5G mobile edge compute, choice on premium experience with Verizon Up and choices of streaming services with exclusive deals only on Verizon. Just this week, we announced HBO Max will be offered on our +play platform. We're empowering our customers to choose the services they need and we're delivering on it. Our disciplined focus is reflected in our first quarter results as we saw continued momentum with step-ups and elevated device upgrades from our customers. As we previously mentioned, as technology megatrends further shift how we will work and live, 2022 is a year for Verizon to scale execution. The world continues to transition toward increased connectivity and the telecommunications industry's role in building our future has never been more vital. Through our key investments across our portfolio of assets, we will continue to build on our unique competitive position in the industry and drive growth across all of our five vectors. As we said before, 5G adoption is already much faster than what we saw when we changed from 3G to 4G. A year after 4G launched, less than 10% of the users had a compatible device. A year after the launch of 5G Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, about 24% of our customers were on 5G devices. 5G device penetration is significant and we expect it will reach 60% of our wireless consumers by the end of 2023, up from 40% at the end of the first quarter. Let me now talk about the momentum in our Business Group. Verizon Business Group continues to have a very strong momentum in wireless. I'm proud to report that Tami and her team delivered the best quarterly full net adds since we formed Verizon Business Group and they are just getting started. We're also rapidly building our 5G mobile edge compute and private 5G networks. Verizon was first in the industry to offer MEC services. This quarter, we partnered with Cisco to deliver the low latency connectivity necessary for autonomous vehicles. As a partner of choice across all categories, we also made our first 5G agreement with a premium global automaker, and we will bring 5G connectivity to the next generation of Audi models starting with their 2024 vehicles. This IoT momentum expands across all our verticals with another strong net add performance this quarter. We're also seeing very promising progress in our private 5G network capabilities, offering small, mid-market and large enterprise clients, turnkey plug-and-play services. I'm also pleased to share that our C-Band launch and aggressive execution, generated nationwide customer enthusiasm for our broadband offerings. Total new broadband customers were the highest in over a decade, with 229,000 net adds driven by a strong increase of 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds. And this is not the one-off. You can see from the current broadband trends that the demand for fixed wireless is extremely high and growing. In the consumer business, we grew postpaid average revenue per account by 2.6% as our users upgraded new 5G packages. ARPA growth is a major part of the strategy that we presented at the Investor Day. In the value market, the TracFone integration continues to unlock an addressable consumer market that we have only just scratched the surface on. We now have the ability to service customers in all segments regardless of the macroeconomic outlook. Manon and I are very encouraged by this opportunity and see tremendous value in the customer base Eduardo and his team have cultivated under the TracFone umbrella. The migration of TracFone subscribers from other networks continues according to plan. In addition to the result in 5G mobility, nationwide broadband, MEC and business to business and the value segment, we also see ongoing momentum in the fifth vector network monetization with growth in volumes driving incremental revenues. Of course, all of this opportunity is built on top of the best network in the industry and the deployment of our 5G Ultra Wideband technology. Kyle and team now have more than 35,000 millimeter wave sites on air and approximately 113 million POPs covered at quarter-end with C-Band. As deployment continues and device penetration ramps, traffic on our Ultra Wideband is increasing rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, 14% of all traffic in urban areas was on 5G Ultra, the result of our combined millimeter wave and mid-band spectrum. We saw a 35% increase in millimeter wave traffic between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. C-Band traffic grew 155% from the end of February to the end of March, where C-Band is deployed, 30% of our wireless traffic uses that spectrum. We have achieved this network evolution in the phase of ongoing supply chain disruption. As I mentioned in previous quarters, our supply chain management is world-class. And we have planned and executed extremely well to anticipate and meet the needs of our customers. We continue to work with our partners with a focus on our deployment targets. We remain diligent in managing a complex global supply chain and count on our expertise to help us to deal with the unexpected. As you come to expect from our technology team, progress is being made throughout our network. In March, we announced a major milestone in the advancement of our 5G network as we work with two satellite companies to secure early clearing of an additional 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in 30 additional markets. Rolling out our C-Band service on this spectrum will expand our 5G market by 40 million potential customers, a full year ahead of schedule. We expect to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of 2022 on C-Band. Early spectrum clearance gives us the speed to market and accelerates the return on capital for our network investments. Having early access to these 30 major markets will support our entire business. It adds consumers and business to our addressable market. And we know from experience that we see customer interest for fixed wireless access as soon as it is available. Our network expansion also supports our mission of digital inclusion, which is key to how we serve our four stakeholders and execute our strategy according to responsible business practices. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. Today, we released our detailed environmental, social and governance report for 2021, and we are proud of our progress. The report covers our ESG strategy in detail and reflects how responsible business practices drive our business. During the first quarter, we completed allocating proceeds from our third green bond offering and issued our fourth $1 billion green bond, which is expected to be allocated towards renewable energy. We also continue to pursue long-term carbon footprint goals as described in previous quarters and in our ESG report. Third quarters have taken notice. We continue to be recognized for our sustainability efforts. During the quarter, MSCI raised our ESG rating to AA, our highest rating to date. And Sustainalytics ranked us strong in ESG risk management and low in overall ESG risk, putting us above our U.S. telecom competitors. As always, what it means to be responsible business depends on global conditions. I'm proud of Verizon's relief efforts to support Ukraine, including extending free calling to and from Ukraine since the start of the war. Taken together, Verizon remains well positioned to compete this year. Our first quarter performance puts us on track for this pivotal investment year, and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term growth targets. Now I will hand the call over to Matt to address our results in detail, as well as some updates on the 2022 guidance. Thank you, Matt. Our priority about 2022 is to continue to execute on our Network as a Service strategy and to drive growth across all our five vectors. This is a critical year for scaling on our strategic investment as we work to capture all of the promise that 5G offers both from a customer experience perspective and for a future revenue growth. We made good progress in this quarter and continue to execute on our long-term plans. Our core business and our strategy showed strength and we have a solid momentum going into the second quarter, all built on the strong confidence in our strategy. Now we're ready to take your questions. Back to you Brady. I'll start, Brett, and then Matt will support later on there. First of all, I mean if you look at the quarter, we had a very good wireless net adds quarter of course because if you look over the combination, our business side was very strong. Consumer also had a good quarter, but a little bit slowness as we said in the prepared remarks in March. However, if you think about it, it's logical. I mean the competition is higher as we've seen now for a while, because we're coming into the second phase of the 5G era and acquisition of 5G customers or sort of an important piece in the market. And what we see is of course, a really good traction for us. I mean our share levels are still very low. We're doing well. We're doing upgrades and step ups all the time. So - and that's our focus, then of course, as we always say, we look into the market and we will take measured actions if it's needed. That's we've done all the time and being very financially disciplined when we come into the market with the offerings and see if there's something we need to do. But right now I feel really good where we are. We're actually with our launch, our Ultra in the beginning of the year, it's really kept made us in a total different situation because our network is just fantastic. And that's what we see from our customers, both on fixed wireless access and both on consumer and business. And this was the whole strategy we laid out. And when we met in the beginning of March, when it comes to our overall long-term strategy, so now I'm pleased what I see then is going to there be competitive market, but that's how it is and I think it's very logical and partly we are sort of coming out with so strong offerings, mix and match and all of that, so the market responding to it. So, yes, I feel good about the strategy. Thanks, Phil. I'll start with overall macro and maybe Matt will fill in a little bit about the gross adds or the question you had. On the inflation, I mean as Matt said in a prepared remarks, I mean we haven't seen so much impact so far of it. But of course, this is the high in 40 years of an inflation. So we are planning for all scenarios. We have plans to be prepared for what it takes. So that will of course include different type of cost adjustments, but also looking into what we can do with pricing. But again, we don't know how this will impact us, but clearly these levels of inflation we have never seen before in the wireless industry. So of course, that also the measurements needs to be thought through in a good way and we are doing that and we have already plans ready for it. So we are going to see what's going to happen. But clearly, we are in a moment in the economy where we really don't know how this is going to impact finally. But the levels are, of course, very high when it comes to inflation. Matt? Thanks, Simon. No, no, this is of course one of the five vectors of growth that we are very focused on and clearly you'll see the momentum growing for us even since we met in the beginning of March. So clearly, as we turn on more and more houses and businesses for sale, we have a good sale too, and the quarter was of course good for us. And we're coming in with the momentum into the next quarter is really good. Then, of course, as we say, we're now deploying sort of the C-Band in urban and suburban, millimeter wave is in urban, LTE is in rural. So that is really now also where the customers are coming onto. But clearly, C-Band is coming quicker in here, we only have even more opportunities. And as you heard me saying in my prepared remarks, we now also have an additional 30 markets that we'll have early clearing on this year, which gives us even more frequency is 100 megahertz. So this is adding all to this momentum we have. And remember, we have been working on this for a while. We know how to do it all the way from the sort of provision of the network capacity management, building and propositions. And that comes through the pricing as well. I think we have a good pricing at the moment with a combined offering and also the standalone offering. And we see that's making a good sort of wave in the market. But as always \u2013 we will always look into what is the right price point, which is the right type of value we're giving our customers. I think we're giving a great value and that's what we see in the numbers. So yes, we have a great momentum coming out from the quarter going into this quarter and we will continue to hammer this as we're having all the five vectors of growth constantly to see that we are reaching our long-term ambitions that we outline in the beginning of this orbit. In the beginning of March, I think that was our Investor Day wasn't time ago. Yes. We start with the fixed wireless access, I mean I can talk for ourselves and I'm not sure what the response will be from someone. But this is a high quality product. The usage of the fixed wireless access is very similar to our Fios users. So this is a primary usage in the vast minority of all the cases when comes to our fixed wireless access. So this is a high quality product that definitely going to compete very well in the market. And in our case, as we said before, this means that we are nationwide with our broadband as we're expanding our C-Band and can be address more and more households. That doesn't mean that we also focus on our Fios footprint, because that is a very strong product in the ILEC we have. And you saw this quarter, again, we're doing well and continue to grow our Fios. And this year, we're going to have more open for sale on the Fios. So for us, as we create optionalities, but we only create high quality products that we believe that the customer wants and then that we are supporting. So that's why I feel good about our whole national broadband strategy that we laid out in the first quarter. So I'm really pleased with that. The second question, I think that when we look at our business and I think we talked very well about at our Investor Day. Our focus is to over time grow this business with 4% and that we do with different levers and of course, based on the best network in the nation, no doubt about that. And our network is just improving and we have just started our C-Band. So we are super excited over the network we have. And then on top of that, of course, the different type of investments we have done in order to grow and to go to 4%. And that I think shareholders should be excited over. And that's what you see in this quarter as well. We are actually executing on those levers. We are ahead of plan on certain on the vectors, which is great to see and that will translate both the top line and the bottom line as we outline in our Investor Day. So that's how I see it. And we will continue to see that we are a premium brand, but remember, nowadays we can actually play in all fields on a wireless all the way from the sort of the prepaid to the high end premium and meet any type of conditions in the market with our portfolio, which is enormous strength. And on top of that, we have a scale of economy on all our offerings, because we own our network, we have built our network and all of that. So I feel really good where we have to say and where we're going and we're going compete well. I mean, I just can tell you that we feel good about it. Matt? I can start with the C-Band. Yeah, for obvious reasons, we see more excitement in the markets where we're turn on the C-Band and also some more upgrades. But remember, we are used in the beginning of the C-Band and we started within the mid basically of the quarter. So we're there in the beginning, but clearly when our customers and consumers see the C-Band turn on this year enormous performance on the network and that is just make a big difference over time. So far, maybe not so much, but clearly the excitement is out there. No, I think that adding on the mobile edge compute, and we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks, but clearly we see the market now with the whole ecosystem coming in there. And we as the pioneer and the leader in the market definitely have more engagement that we had before. People think little bit to private networks in the beginning 5G private networks and then you build on the mobile edge compute on that. So now I see this as a traditional B2B and not only that it's definitely clearly a way for us to build new relationship with our enterprise customer. But I said before this year we are building that funnel, we're making it, and of course when come to meaningful revenue, a little bit higher that's going to be more next year. So, but clearly this year we're going to talk a lot about and show you what we're doing, the solutions we have and remember also we have the smaller solution for SMBs when it comes to private 5G networks. We see so many use cases, and remember all is built on how we built the network from the beginning where we basic from the data center to the edge of the network, have one unified network which is fibered. And then at the edge of the network, we can do different solution for different type of customer groups. This is going to pay off big time the next five to 10 years and I feel really good about how we built the network and seeing also the importance of mobility broadband and cloud in our society for businesses and people. I think we're so well placed in this, so I feel good about it. Yes, it is more \u2013 more ambition to continue. When it comes to capital intensity, I think we outlined that very clearly that we will have the peak year now, then we're coming down. And then in 2024, 2025 we will have a BAU that is below 12%, which is of course over a decade, the lowest we've had, but that is coming from the investment levels we have done and prepared the network. In there of course we have the BAU expansion on C-Band, so that's clear and already right now as you know, we have moved up. So now we will have doing at least 175 million POPs covered this year. And then of course that means also that other pieces of the network will come earlier and topping that with so far, we're only using 60 megahertz, now we're adding 100 megahertz in the next 30 markets. But remember in average we 161 megahertz nationwide and in many and mostly in the rural areas, we're up to 200 megahertz. So of course we invested in this spectrum in order to be extremely competitive and do things that nobody else can do. So we going to continue to do it, but that doesn't change the profile that Matt and I laid out when it comes to capital intensity. That's included, but clearly we're going to take advantage of the investments we've done and the sooner we do it, the better it is. I can start with the second one because I remember it, and I will come to the wireless customers. So on the Fios you're right, 550,000 open for sale this year, which is an increase from 2021. And we will continue to look for opportunities to expand as our customers are allowing the product. So there are no limitation on that. That's of course of the focus is in the ILEC when we're doing the expansion outside that we \u2013 we predominantly working with fixed wise access. So ultimately we want to give high quality products on broadband that can be used for everything you need in a home or in a business and that's what we're catering for either to fixed wireless access on Fios. So we going to continue to see if we accelerate depending on customer demands, but clearly as we're increasing Fios this year compared to last year, we see that happening, and our capture rate on Fios is of course magnificent, it's great. We're really strong on it. When it comes to the wireless customers and I guess I don't 100% remember the questions, so Matt will probably support me at the end there. But one thing that we need to remember the strength of a SMB, for example, that we've had now for many quarters that is a clearly a segment that is doing when on wireless, then on the same time as Matthew said, we see our customers continue to do upgrade and step ups. That is part of our strategy and that we're seeing in our base constantly. So I don't think that is a big difference from previous quarters we've seen before, but I'm not sure maybe Matthew have something more than that."

            "content": "Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last month, we talked about 2022 as a critical year for scaling the business and making investments to position Verizon for the long-term. And this quarter, we may progress along that path. At that event, we said we expect to generate an incremental $14 billion of service and other revenue from the business by 2025, and that we expect to get there through leveraging our unique collection of assets against our five growth vectors. We expect over 75% of our growth over the next four years will come from 5G mobility and nationwide broadband. And our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our growth prospects. Our consumer and business units will measure success in mobility by how we perform in the areas of ARPA, premium unlimited penetration and subscribers and accounts. We've talked about our plans for increasing the value of our existing base of wireless customers through step up to higher value data plans. The first quarter saw us achieve an increase in consumer postpaid ARPA of 2.6% year-over-year, positioning us for high quality revenue and earnings growth going forward. 64% of new accounts selected premium unlimited, and together with continued step-up momentum drove our premium penetration up to 36%. With respect to subscribers and new accounts, for the first quarter, we reported postpaid phone net losses of 36,000, which represents an improvement of 142,000 or 80% from a year ago and our best first quarter performance since 2018. The performance was driven by our business team, which contributed a record 256,000 phone net adds, the highest from the unit since Verizon 2.0 reporting began. These results were driven by strength in the three wireless customer groups as SMB, Enterprise, and Public Sector, each delivered double digit phone gross ad growth and extended the momentum built in the second half of last year. We expect this strong performance to continue as we approach something closer to a pre pandemic environment. On the Consumer side phone net losses were 292,000 in the quarter. While churn was study, we saw a decline in phone gross adds of 2% from the prior year. This gross add trend was more pronounced in March and is continuing into April. We will continue to take appropriate measures to be competitive in the market. We are pleased with the quality of the business that we are writing and are confident in the value of the postpaid phone gross adds we are attracting. Our retail postpaid accounts at the end of Q1 across Consumer and Business are up 40,000 from last year. Consumer and Business segment performance in the nationwide broadband vector was strong and demonstrates the opportunity to scale this business. We measure our success against this vector by households and businesses covered by broadband and the total subscribers on our networks. As Hans mentioned, the early clearance spectrum announcement is a major milestone for Verizon. Our network team is now able to deploy this spectrum a full year sooner than expected unlocking another 40 million of addressable population. We feel confident that our C-Band network will cover at least 175 million POPs by the end of this year, and will cover 50 million household and 14 million businesses with fixed wireless access by the end of 2025. The addressable opportunity expansion continues in Fios as well with 115,000 incremental open for sale in the quarter. We are seeing strong uptake in our broadband offers, and we expect increasing momentum as more and more people get access to our 5G Ultra Wideband and find service throughout the year. We had 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds across the portfolio, which is 2.5 times our 4Q 2021 performance. Consumers continue to see the benefit of the speed, reliability, and simplicity of installation of the FWA product. And businesses continue to recognize that FWA can be a primary broadband access solution for all of their needs. The total broadband, we registered 229,000 net ads representing our highest net ads in over a decade. Fios Internet contributed 60,000 net ads within the quarter, driven by record low levels of churn. Now let's move on to the MEC & B2B solutions vector. Tami and the team continue to make great progress in this space. Within IoT, the team delivered another strong quarter of connection growth. We're seeing success across our verticals, working with our customers to deliver the solutions that they need. As we mentioned during our Investor Day, we anticipate that connections will continue to grow at a double-digit pace. With our investments and key partnerships, we continue to expand the ecosystem for MEC, as well as advance our deployments in private wireless and private MEC. Our market differentiation is unmatched in terms of scale and capabilities. And we are well positioned to accelerate our long-term revenue growth within this space. Now, let's talk about the value market. Q1 marks a first full quarter of TracFone included in our consumer results. Our integration of TracFone is going as planned, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. We measure our success in the value market based on prepaid ARPU, prepaid subscribers, and prepaid revenue. Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of our prepaid brands. This declined in part because TracFone ARPU is lower than our legacy Verizon prepaid ARPU. Additionally, we saw quarter-over-quarter pressure specifically in the TracFone brands in part due to the transition from the Emergency Broadband Benefit program to the affordable connectivity program, which negatively impacted ARPUs benefits dropped from $50 to $30. Going forward, we expect prepaid ARPU to stabilize and subsequently grow as we execute in our strategy to bring additional value to this space. While we experience certain device inventory pressure throughout the quarter, especially in January, the team finished strong and delivered first quarter volumes in TracFone that compare favorably to of prior years, excluding 2021 activity, which benefited from stimulus programs. Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of $77,000, while total Verizon prepaid net losses in the quarter were $80,000. Next let's move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 14. On a consolidated basis, Verizon delivered strong wireless service revenue growth in a highly competitive environment in the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.5%, reflecting the first full quarter of TracFone ownership, as well as continued execution of our Network-as-a-Service strategy and contributions from our five vectors of growth. Service and other revenue was down 2.5% in the quarter, as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, service and other revenue was up 4.2% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.0 billion in for the quarter down year-over-year by 1.1% do in part to elevated marketing expenses. We introduced our 5G Ultra Campaign at the beginning of the year to support our C-Band launch and FWA expansion. Combined with lower spending on the first quarter of 2021 driven by COVID-related impacts on our operations, marketing expenses represented a year-over-year drag on first quarter EBITDA growth. Other items impacting Q1 EBITDA including the disposition of Verizon Media, which had EBITDA levels above those that TracFone added in the quarter, especially considering the investment we're starting to put into the TracFone brands. We expect marketing expenses to return to more normal levels in Q2. And we will begin to lap the prior year ramp up in tower expenses, which also represented a year-over-year pressure in Q1. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was a $1.35, relatively in line with prior year. The bottom-line performance shows the strength of our core business to deliver profitability, even in a period of significant investment, as well as other headwinds. Now let's take a look at our Consumer financial results in Q1. Total Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9% year-over-year, driven by first full quarter of TracFone inclusion, higher equipment revenue, and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 11.2% year-over-year. These results were driven by the inclusion of TracFone as well as our increase in postpaid ARPA, which was driven by the strong step-up momentum I discussed earlier and growth within our non-connectivity products and services. Moving to File Services, we continue to see volume and rate gains with broadband of setting pressures from video and voice as total files revenue grew 1.8%. Consumer EBITDA was $10.5 billion up year-over-year by 1.0%. This growth is a result of the inclusion TracFone as well as ARPA and customer volume gains, partially offset by the items mentioned earlier, such as higher marketing expenses, investments in TracFone and higher bad debt, driven mainly by higher sales volumes in the quarter. Similarly, the higher sales activity resulted in elevated equipment revenue, pressuring EBITDA margins, which were 41.4% in the quarter. Margins were additionally pressured by the inclusion of the results of TracFone, which is a business that has historically operated with margins below the legacy consumer business. Now let's take a closer look at the business financial results on Slide 16. The Verizon Business Group continues to see strong wireless sales and service momentum within the business space, alongside the ongoing wireline service declines. Wireless service revenue growth of 2.1% was led by momentum in our SMB Group, which continues to see strong post-pandemic recovery. The rate of growth is an improvement from last quarter's 1.5% and with 1Q last year representing the peak for distance learning devices, we expect Business wireless service revenue growth to expand over the rest of 2022. Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 9.3% from the prior year. The decline in EBITDA was driven in part by the ongoing reduction in high margin wireline revenue. Additionally, we experienced elevated levels of subsidy related to the strong wireless Q1 sales volume, which were up 20% year-over-year. EBITDA margin was 22.5%, similarly impacted by wireline service trends and wireless sales volumes. Let's move to Slide 17, the cashflow summary. Cashflow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion, compared with $9.7 billion from the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted receivables and inventory increased as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. Capital spending for the first quarter, totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion. The continued build out of OneFiber and our investment to support growth of traffic on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network great extends our opportunity to effectively compete in all of our businesses. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $1.0 billion. We exited the quarter with $135.6 billion of net unsecured debt, an increase of $1.9 billion sequentially as we issued our fourth Green Bond, with the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, we completed a number of other transactions during the quarter the proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost, long-term debt. We ended the quarter with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8 times flat on a sequential basis as expected. Lastly, let's move to guidance to the remainder of the year. I want to provide some additional detail around our view of the macro environment in which we operate and give context around our guidance for 2022. We saw inflationary pressures building towards the end of the first quarter and expect those to continue given the current environment. The major areas of exposure for us at energy related costs for our network operations and transportation, as well as labor related costs, including both our direct workforce and third parties. While these items have not had a significant impact on our overall results to date, they represent a meaningful portion of our direct cost structure and have the potential to drive additional expense pressure throughout the rest of the year. We also believe that the inflation we are seeing throughout the economy may alter both the consumer and business landscaping, which we compete. It is too early to predict how this change landscape may impact our near-term results or how long it will last. But we are confident that the strategy we have put in place will allow us to achieve our long-term growth plans. There's also been a significant increase in treasury yields recently, but as a reminder, the vast majority of our debt approximately 75% to 80% is fixed rate. The team has kept near-term maturities in the next 12 months to 24 months at manageable levels, which also helps minimize near-term interest rate exposure. If the present forecast of Fed rate hikes are accurate, we anticipate an incremental cash interest impact for the year above our early expectations of $150 million to $200 million. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. On the revenue side, we now anticipate service and other revenue to be approximately flat to 2021, significant items affecting our service and other revenue include USF rate reductions, which are pressuring year-over-year revenue by several hundred million and softness in wireline sales. We are keeping the guidance ranges of wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Based upon our expectations around service and other revenue as well as the macro economic pressures, we now expect to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance ranges for these items. For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business as usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion to see band related spending. We will continue to invest in the business and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities discussed during our Investor Day. With that, I'll turn it over to Hans to close out our 2022 priorities. Hey, John, so good morning. Thanks for the questions. On the EEB messaging there, there's certainly - we're seeing that change in the programs as we go forward here, but no major impact on customer volumes related to that. I think your bigger question on Verizon Consumer Group and the margins we saw in the quarter. So a couple of major things in there, certainly some one-time increases in costs as we look at the quarter. We were very, very strong on our marketing spend this quarter with the launch of C-Band, new price plans, launch of fixed wireless on C-Band as well and everything around that. So that's in the quarter we would expect that to be returned to more normal levels as we head here into second quarter and go forward. And then of course, you saw the volumes up year-over-year that has some impact in there, and then Trac I mentioned in my prepared remarks so that has an impact. Initially that's going to be in the 100 basis point to 200 basis point range impact as you bring Trac into the overall VCG mix. And then as we work through the integration and bring all of the customers in Trac onto our network that impact will lessen as we complete the integration over the next 12 months to 24 months. So combination of things in there, but certainly would expect to see a little bit of a slight uptake as we head into the rest of the year here on the \u2013 our consumer margin. Yes. And Brett, your question on cash flows, you \u2013 in your question, you used to phrase it a timing factor in here, and I think absolutely that's part of what we're seeing. So couple of things on the receivable side with the last couple of years, we actually had some tailwinds associated with some of the impacts of the lower volumes that came through as we went through the pandemic. And now we're seeing those volumes return to more normal levels, which creates a temporary headwind, but it's really just getting back to where we were. You think about device payment levels, those are certainly up year-over-year. As we said, activations were up in the quarter 11%. Therefore, we've more device loans on the balance sheet, but it's really getting back to those pre-pandemic levels rather than anything else. We saw an actual benefit in core customer payments that helped the year ago number with all the subsidy money out there. That was a one-time benefit that we're lapping. Customer payments continue to be incredibly strong. So we're very pleased with that. And then the inventory side, as we've managed through some of the disruptions that we've seen there, we've taken advantage of the balance sheet strength we have to run it higher the normal inventory levels. But obviously, I would be looking to have us return to more normal levels on that over time here. So I expect those to be just timing factors as you said in your question and continues to be very competent in the overall strengths of the cash flows that this business produces. Yes. There's certainly a little bit of an increase in, it is largely what you see in the inventory side of the balance sheet there coming from handsets and so on. So there is a little bit more cushion in there in the system so to speak, which we think is appropriate given the environment that everyone's operating in. But it's certainly something that we have \u2013 we think gives us a good position in the marketplace and as supply chains become more predictable again going forward, we'll adjust that accordingly. Yes. Phil, so your question around just what we're seeing there. Look, I would tell you that there is nothing that we see in the data that suggests any change in share out there. Certainly believe there has been a bit of a down tick in overall foot traffic, not just in our stores, but up and down the high street. But our share continues to be where we would expect it to be. Our churn continues to be very strong and that's always a good indicator of if we are competing effectively and clearly with the churn at these levels versus historical levels, we feel very good about that. So overall continuing to get our fair share and we expect to continue to do so. Yes. So just a couple of things add on there. So Simon, as you think about the volumes we had in the first quarter, remember, that's not a full quarter of C-Band. That came on in middle of January. And of course, you have that time period where the sales teams are building up the sales motion of selling a new product. So certainly think that we can continue to see good numbers there as we go through the rest of the year. And we're just getting started with what you saw the 194,000 in the first quarter. And from a pricing standpoint, as Hans said, it's \u2013 you should think about it that price point you mentioned is for a customer, who's also taking wireless products from us as well. On a standalone basis, it's higher price, but we'll continue to look at the pricing proposition and maximize both the value for customers, but also the opportunity for us as well. If I just had one comment onto Hans' last piece there, while certainly we always want to find a higher gear and never happy with a result, I think we can do better next year. The phone ads was 142,000 battery in 1Q this year than last year. So you see us continuing to make progress there. On the guidance, Mike, so as you think through it, in terms of the lower end of range on wireless service revenue. Part of that is obviously as we see the nature of the competitive environment, but it's also the volumes that you see us delivering and some of the impacts of that. So excited by 11% increase in activations year-over-year that shows strong interest from our customers, but that of course does mean that we see the amortization impact from promo come through the wireless service revenue and so we'll see that impact there. That of course will also impact the EBITDA guidance, but EBITDA guidance also has our views on inflation as well as we think about the year as a whole and certainly those views have evolved over the has 90 days for everyone as well. And then so obviously EBITDA impacts the EPS guidance and the EPS also has the interest expense that I commented on in my prepared remarks that it's probably the low-single digit impact on an EPS basis that obviously come through as a result of higher Fed hikes and was probably in people's plans at the start of the year. So a number of factors impact in each of those items. We still feel very confident in the results of the business we'll produce this year and the momentum that we're building in the year across the growth vectors to deliver the long-term aspirations that we all have. Yes. Thanks Craig. So as you think about it, so when you look at the P times Q that you mentioned, we got ARPU up to 2.6% on the postpaid side. So certainly see a continuation of executing on the strategy. We've talked about of stepping customers up, getting more customers on premium plans. The team continues to do a good job there and you see that in the, a side. You also see as we mentioned an increase in the number of accounts on wireless year-over-year, 40,000 more accounts this year than this time a year ago. So the P times Q there works, but this comes back to what we talked about at the Investor Day, having five vectors of growth and really what we talked about there is just one of them. In addition to that, obviously we've got fixed wireless access kicking in now, 194,000 net ads in the first quarter, over 400,000 in the base that's exactly in line with what we said you should see with increasing the base this year and therefore that having a more meaningful impact on revenue in 2023, but we're building that base now in line with what we said. And then you laid out the things like MEC and obviously on that not just within the B2B space, mobile edge compute but also as we get into the 5G world. The scope of opportunity for IoT, a machine to machine continues to increase, and we talked about the momentum we have there, and that's just really getting started. On the prepaid side we continue to see that the integration of TracFone going as expected and we expect that to add value as we go forward here, and then we continue to see growth in our network monetization vector too. So we still feel very confident that we have the ability to grow across more vectors than other people that starts with mobility and extends into the other one, but absolutely think you'll see growth across all of those. Hans? Yes. So Doug, just add onto that a little bit. If you think about network usage and customers demand on the network continues to grow year-over-year that's true across every geography. So you should expect no difference in how we think out C-Band rollout to get 5G Ultra Wideband to all of our customers, the same way we did with LTE rollout a decade ago. And as you saw with the LTE rollout, as we got out of the initial launch areas to more nationwide, we did that within our overall CapEx envelope and that's what we've described that you should expect from us as we do the same thing with C-Band and get the 5G experience to all of our customers as soon as possible here. Yes. So on the comments about March and April volumes, those are predominantly on the consumer side, nothing particular in terms of breaking the consumer apart there in terms of particular areas. But as Hans said the VBG site, Verizon Business Group continues to do very strong performance across small business, enterprise, public sector, double-digit growth and gross ads across each of those parts of Tami's business in the first quarter. And that really fairly even throughout the quarter. So we saw a little lower foot traffic on the consumer side, but the business side continues to perform at a fairly even level throughout the quarter and as we head into Q2 here."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results. You'll find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. We'd like to note that Verizon's fourth quarter reporting earnings per share were negatively impacted by a number of special items, which are discussed in the written remarks available on our Investor Relations website. The largest of the impacts was also disclosed in our 8-K filing last Wednesday. Excluding these special items, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.08. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I hope you all had a great start of 2024. I'm pleased to report that Verizon closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, finishing off a year of solid operation and financial performance. For us, 2023 was a year of continuous improvement and important actions across the business. We made significant changes to how we operate and to our team, and those changes paid off. We stabilized our core business and positioned the company for renewed growth and profitability. We built strong momentum quarter after quarter, culminating in a very good holiday season. And finally, we met the guidance that we provided to you in each of our key performance indicators. Entering 2024, Verizon stands ready to further unlock our performance potential at an accelerating rate. We now have all the assets, the best team in the business, and a focus on continued operational excellence to deliver even better results going forward. Let me share some full-year highlights with you. Wireless service revenue for 2023 was $76.7 billion, a 3.2% year-over-year increase. We delivered outstanding volumes during a healthy fourth quarter where our customers clearly embraced our offerings. Full-year adjusted EBITDA was $47.8 billion, contributing to a very strong free cash flow of $18.7 billion, reflecting our disciplined and strategic approach to profitable growth. As a result of our financial strength, we raised our dividend for the 17th year in a row with a healthy free cash flow dividend payout ratio of approximately 59%. We also reduced our year-over-year leverage, while continuing to bring CapEx back towards business as usual levels. This aligns with the capital allocation priorities we have shared in recent years. These results provide a solid foundation for Verizon's journey and future success. And I'm pleased that we put the leadership and team in place last year that will serve Verizon stakeholders well in both the short and long term. We as a team have focused on capturing the market opportunity, and I'm proud of our progress in 2023. Just two weeks ago, Leslie Berland joined Verizon as our Chief Marketing Officer. I'm excited to bring her on board and have a great confidence in her ability to continue shaping Verizon's premium brand perception and story. We started 2023 determined to differentiate ourselves by investing even more in profitable growth while transforming Verizon to make the company more efficient and effective. Seeing the continued strength of the U.S. consumer, busy holiday store traffic and rising demand for mobility, broadband and private networks, we also took actions to fuel growth during the fourth quarter, and it showed in our results. A standout milestone in 2023 was our launch of myPlan, which was designed from extensive customer research to be the most flexible plan available to U.S. consumers from any wireless company. myPlan has been a great success that has seen stellar adoption. Introduced in May, we already have 13.1 million myPlan subscribers. And these customers using premium packages and our unique perks driving ARPA. Other changes we made in 2023 include establishing a regional distribution model, tailoring our approach to every market, revamping sales composition to support productivity and introducing new price plans and promotions in Consumer and Business. Verizon Business also partnered with HCLTech to be more efficient to deliver post-sale implementation and customer support for managed network services, enhancing our customer service while saving Verizon money. These actions paired with all of our assets sets us up very well for 2024. We are now working from an effective model and this is just the start. Overall, the wireless industry is strong as we head into 2024, and we are confident in our strategy. We have great offerings with optionality to meet the needs of customers of any budget on the best network in the country. Now, let me share a bit more how each of our service performed in the fourth quarter. Starting with mobility. We had 449,000 postpaid phone net adds, driven by improving net adds in Consumer and a continued sustainable performance in Verizon Business. Our disciplined and segmented market approach is working with customers and creating great economics for our shareholders. In Consumer, you can see the pattern of continuous improvements from the start of the year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered our best postpaid phone gross adds performance since 2019 and our best net adds in two years. We added 318,000 postpaid phone customers in the fourth quarter and our gross adds were up almost 17% year-over-year. It is clear that we have momentum in Consumer as we move into 2024, and we'll continue to work to get our fair share on new business. Our customer-centric offers are resonating in the market, and we're just getting started. By leveraging Verizon's large subscriber base and key partnership, we can deliver exclusive discount offers like Netflix and Max for just $10 a month, underscoring our industry leadership in value-driven content offerings. With our vast network coverage and the largest base of loyal customers, we're uniquely positioned to provide targeted high-value deals that deepen relationship across connected devices, streaming and more. Within the value business, which includes our prepaid offerings like TracFone, Visible and Total by Verizon, we still have work to do but are making progress. Moving to Verizon Business. The team continued to deliver on mobility with total postpaid phone net adds of 131,000 for the fourth quarter 2023, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of postpaid phone net adds above 125,000. For the full year, Business added 562,000 phone net adds, an outstanding result. Our Business customers are prioritizing mobility and value the optionality we offer with highly-tailored plans on the best network in the country. Now, let's turn to broadband. For the year, we had more than 1.7 million broadband net adds, with more than 1.5 million net adds from fixed wireless access and 248,000 net adds from Fios, a nice increase over 2022. On fixed wireless access, we're consistently adding more than 350,000 subscribers per quarter, which is part of our plan for steady, sustainable growth that exceeds what we expected at launch. Just three years of the launch, we serve more than 3 million fixed wireless access customers, well ahead of our stated goal of 4 million to 5 million subscribers by the end of 2025. With fixed wireless access, we're expanding into new markets and proving the value of Verizon's connectivity. Customers are finding strong reliability and speed in fixed wireless access and that shows in our results, including a very strong Net Promoter Score. For a product that still is in the beginning, the pace of adoption has the team super excited. We expect this will be a long-term source of recurring revenue for Verizon, and we're entering this year with a strong base for continued growth. Turning to the private networks and our 5G business solutions. We continue to see interest from large enterprises running complex logistics and operations like ports, automotive and heavy industries. In November, Norfolk International Terminal contracted us to build a second private 5G network for them. Audi, already one of our partners in smart car development, has contracted us to build a private network for their automotive tech testing environment. And Nucor, one of the country's largest steel companies, has us building private networks for three of its sites with more to come over the next year. Strategically, we're building a new source of revenue expansion where we are the clear leader. Last year, we also expanded existing 5G private networks partnerships with NFL to bring new spectator and retail experience to fans everywhere. When we build relationships with these large enterprises and they see what our network can do for them, there is always potential for more business. And our network is just getting better and better every day. With full access to our spectrum as of the end of third quarter last year, our mission is to optimize the experience in every market and expand into suburban and rural markets, where we know our consumer and business customers are eager to take up our offerings. We have been expanding and improving our network in key markets through 2023 and into this year. I have said it before and I will say it again, our network is the foundation how we offer the best value and premium experience to our customers. And we're now seeing our investment in C-Band paying off in terms of customer experience and loyalty. Where we have C-Band, we see higher gross adds, lower churn and more step ups to premium services. We also see increased uptake of customers taking both mobility and broadband services. Meanwhile, millimeter wave, which we have now deployed in many urban areas and all 30 NFL stadiums, sets Verizon apart with an outstanding performance at high density areas and public event spaces. And for the 32nd consecutive time, Verizon was the most awarded company in the country for wireless network quality, with the first place rankings in each of J.D. Power's six regions. We are the network that America relies on, and we take that commitment very seriously. Looking ahead, our priorities for 2024 are crystal clear. We remain laser-focused on growing wireless service revenue and expanding our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to allow for a meaningful debt reduction in the year ahead. This is what our whole team is working towards and what you, our shareholders, and our Board want us to focus on. Tony will have more details for you, but we anticipate strong wireless service revenue growth of 2% to 3.5% in 2024, which reflects our ability to sustain the top-line of our business as we continue to pursue the right balance of profitability and customer growth. Our adjusted EBITDA profile will continue to improve as we become even more efficient with growth, cost saving measures and our disciplined promotional spending. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And as we lower our capital intensity from the C-Band build out and our new business structure, we expect to see continued strong free cash flow generation going forward. That will enable our Board to continue to raise our dividend and also enable us to bring down leverage. Now, Tony will discuss the quarter as well as our operations and guidance in more detail.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Executing on our plan, we finished the year strong and delivered on our financial guidance. We exited the year with good momentum and remain committed to our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In 2023, we set out to improve our operational performance while sustaining financial discipline. Our fourth quarter and full year results confirm that our strategy is working and that we can deliver strong financials and improve key operating metrics. Consumer postpaid phone net adds totaled 318,000 for the quarter, a substantial improvement of 369,000 sequentially and 277,000 compared to the prior year. Our Consumer postpaid phone churn of 0.88% represents a stable result even after we implemented over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023. While we do not provide specific guidance on volumes, we wanted to share a couple of items as we look into 2024. In the first quarter, we are taking additional targeted pricing actions that we expect will result in incremental pressure on Consumer postpaid phone churn in the period. However, we expect to deliver positive Consumer postpaid phone net adds in full year 2024 as we execute on our strategy of growing our subscriber base while being financially disciplined. Postpaid phone gross adds in the quarter were up nearly 17% year-over-year. This represents our best quarterly Consumer gross add performance in four years. Our attractive myPlan offers combined with our segmented approach to the market, regional sales structure and disciplined promotional strategy continued to deliver strong results. Additionally, postpaid upgrades remained lower as compared to the prior year. The Consumer postpaid upgrade rate was 4.4% in the fourth quarter, down 120 basis points year-over-year as a result of approximately 19% fewer upgrades. As Hans said, we continue to see better performance in markets where we have deployed C-Band. In our first 76 C-Band markets, fourth quarter Consumer postpaid phone gross add growth was 8 percentage points better than in non-C-Band markets. Additionally, Consumer postpaid phone churn in C-Band markets was 4 basis points better than in non-C-Band markets. The strong momentum in the quarter combined with the continued deployment of our C-Band network positions us well in 2024. The quality of the business we are writing in Consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive premium plan adoption. The premium take rate in C-Band markets for the quarter was more than 10 percentage points higher than in non-C-Band markets. Consumer ARPA of $134.10 represents an increase of 4.7% year-over-year. This was driven by new customer additions, premium plan adoption and fixed wireless subscriber growth. We expect continued and healthy organic ARPA growth in 2024. Our prepaid results remain challenged in the fourth quarter. This is in part to seasonally weaker national retail sales volumes, which is the primary sales channel for our TracFone brands. We also continue to see pricing pressures from low-end postpaid offerings. Prepaid net losses for the quarter were 289,000. During the quarter, we saw continued strong growth within the Visible and Total by Verizon brands, which we will continue to scale. The team is also focused on our partnerships to improve the performance of the Straight Talk brand. We believe we're taking the right steps to better position our offerings in the market and expect to see some stabilization in 2024. Verizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 131,000 phone net adds, which as Hans mentioned, is our 10th consecutive quarter above 125,000. The Business Markets Group had its best phone net add performance in the last two years, demonstrating how our value proposition is resonating with small and medium businesses. Similar to Consumer, we are taking pricing actions in the first quarter in Business that could result in elevated phone churn in the period. However, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong business volumes in 2024. Moving on to broadband, we delivered 413,000 net additions in the quarter continuing the pace of over 400,000 broadband net adds for the fifth consecutive quarter. We see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless offerings, and we continue to see positive responses from customers regarding the quality and reliability of our services. In fixed wireless, we delivered 375,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to over 3 million subscribers. We launched C-Band in early 2022, and our fixed wireless success in the last two years reflects the strong demand for high-quality broadband and the strength and reliability of our product. Notably, in the fourth quarter, over 80% of our consumer fixed wireless gross adds came from C-Band markets. The growth trajectory for fixed wireless continues to be robust and we are ahead of schedule to achieve our 4 million to 5 million subscriber goal by year-end 2025. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, down 4,000 year-over-year. We are pleased with the success of Fios with strong gross adds and retention, reflecting the quality and overall value of the product. We expect broadband subscriber momentum to extend into 2024 as we continue deployment of our C-Band spectrum, further expand our Fios footprint and bring new products and offers to the market. Let's now look at our financials. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $35.1 billion, down 0.3% year-over-year. This change can be attributed to the wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 2% lower than the prior year as total postpaid upgrades declined by approximately 18%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.4 billion, up 3.2% year-over-year. Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans and growth in fixed wireless access. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduced total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 70 basis points year-over-year as well as promo amortization. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $11.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the prior year. Higher wireless service revenue and the benefits of lower upgrades were more than offset by higher marketing and bad debt expense and ongoing declines in Business wireline revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.2% was relatively flat year-over-year. In 2023, we implemented transformations within our Consumer customer care group as well as Business managed services. We are pleased with what we have achieved this year and our cost saving measures are meeting our expectations. We expect further progress on our cost efficiency program in 2024. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 in the quarter, resulting in full year adjusted EPS of $4.71. Turning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $8.7 billion, bringing the total for 2023 to $37.5 billion. This marks a year-over-year improvement of over $300 million, primarily due to working capital improvements. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.6 billion compared to $7.3 billion in the prior year. The full year CapEx totaled $18.8 billion, which represents a more than $4 billion reduction in capital spending from 2022 as we come down from our peak C-Band spending level. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $4.1 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $18.7 billion, a $4.7 billion increase over the prior year, driven by operational improvements and the lower CapEx spending that we previously noted. We are pleased to have delivered on our guidance of more than $18 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which reflects our balanced and strategic approach to delivering profitable growth. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.4 billion, a $1.6 billion improvement year-over-year. Net unsecured debt increased sequentially primarily due to settling the $3.7 billion in incentive payments to satellite operators for our remaining C-Band spectrum. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times as of the end of the fourth quarter, in-line with the prior two quarters. We expect deleveraging of the balance sheet to accelerate in 2024 as CapEx comes down to BAU levels and we continue to generate strong cash flow. Additionally, we continue to benefit from our approach to managing long-term debt and have only $3.6 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2024. Overall, I'm pleased with our momentum exiting the year and our performance in 2023, delivering an improved operational profile while also meeting our financial guidance. Now, I want to take a few moments to look ahead and walk through our 2024 guidance. Our 2024 guidance demonstrates our expectations for accelerating wireless service revenue growth. As a reminder, the reported 2023 wireless service revenue growth of 3.2% included approximately 190 basis points of benefit from a reallocation of other revenues. Excluding this reallocation, the 2023 wireless service revenue growth was 1.3%. For 2024, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2% and 3.5%. This will be driven by anticipated positive postpaid phone net additions in both Consumer and Business, continued fixed wireless access subscriber growth, further adoption of premium unlimited plans, growth in products and services, and pricing action benefits. We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA to grow by 1% to 3% versus the prior year. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue and the impact of our cost transformation initiatives, partially offset by continued pressure in Business wireline revenues and increased wireless network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.50 to $4.70. As noted, we expected adjusted EBITDA to grow in 2024, offset by certain below-the-line impacts. Specifically, higher interest expense is expected to impact adjusted EPS by $0.16 to $0.19, over 75% of which is driven by the continued reduction in capitalized interest related to the C-Band licenses being placed into service. In addition, EPS is expected to be impacted by approximately $0.07 to $0.09 of higher pension and OPEB expense, primarily due to the expiration of certain credits. This impact will flow through the other income and expense line on our income statement. We expect depreciation and amortization to be relatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24% based on current legislation. As discussed in prior quarters, capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $17 billion and $17.5 billion, down from $18.8 billion in 2023. While we are not providing guidance on 2024 free cash flow, we wanted to provide some additional color to aid with your analysis. Tailwinds to free cash flow will come from our adjusted EBITDA growth outlook as well as the expected $1.5 billion reduction in CapEx in 2024 based on the midpoint of our guided CapEx range. Offsets will be higher interest expense and higher cash taxes. As a reminder, the majority of the higher interest expense relates to reductions in capitalized interest. Such interest was recognized in cash flow from investing prior to placing the C-Band spectrum into service. The higher cash taxes are primarily related to the continued phaseout of bonus depreciation in 2024 based on current legislation. Overall, we expect a strong free cash flow profile that will support our capital allocation priorities and position us for meaningful unsecured debt reduction in 2024, which we expect to come in the latter half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans for his closing thoughts.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. As you heard today, we're confident and well positioned to deliver a solid 2024. Thanks to our best-in-class network, which is only getting better, we offer the mobile and broadband services that customer value and need the most. Our industry is critical to the next wave of innovation, and Verizon is ready to capitalize on the opportunity of the AI economy to bring this technology to life for all our stakeholders. As I said in the beginning, we have the right team in place to execute the next chapter in Verizon's history. I'm proud of the work our team accomplished in 2023 and excited what we will deliver in 2024. Our results in C-Band markets speaks for themselves and support our investment decisions, and we're going to lean in further as we expand into suburban and rural markets while maintaining the financial discipline you come to expect from us. We will continue to stay very close to our customers to understand their needs and preferences, so that we can offer the right promotions at the right times in the right markets. We have the right people, the right assets and the right strategy. Our focus for 2024 is on execution. It's a winning combination, and we are very confident heading into this year. Finally, I want to remind you that we are hosting an investor event on February 5 and encourage everyone to tune in to the webcast. Given the financial update today, next month will be more of an operational and strategic update on the company. Now, Brady, we're ready to take questions.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I'd love to drill down on the couple of things. Firstly, the sub trends, 17% growth is some real momentum. I know, Hans, you talked about a number of sort of potential drivers, but if there's anything you could sort of be specific and sort of talk about what drove that in the quarter and is that likely to continue? Also, the account growth, is that likely to continue? And then, you talked about some churn on the price increase. Anything you could say about sort of the net add momentum as we look into '24? That's first. And maybe for Tony, nice service revenue growth. Any additional info you can kind of give us to sort of unpack that in terms of the price increase impact versus last year and what you're seeing in terms of tier, that would be great. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Hey, John, thank you for the question. So, let me start about the subs then. On the Business side, 10th quarter in a row, more than 125,000. Kyle and his team is doing a great job. We are -- our network is performing so well, so our customers just continue to buy in with us. Not only that, our offerings in our go-to-market is as strong as ever. So, we feel really good about what Kyle and his team is doing. On the Consumer side, yeah, we had a good fourth quarter, but you have seen also through the year that we have sequentially improved all the time. Everything started where we started with a new offering, myPlan, which resonates with the market, very much consumer insights in it. Then on top of that, Sampath has done a lot of changes in our structure, all the way from the go-to-market, the incentives in our stores and our decentralization of it. So, it hangs together all the way. So, I think the most important, we have the right offerings in the market and that has really resonated on the Consumer side. So, I'm really happy with the team. We will continue to execute on the plan we have and we have started.\nTony Skiadas: Hey, John, it's Tony. Good morning. So, just to add on to what Hans mentioned, we did really well in Tier 1 markets. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, about 8 percentage points better, and we were also net add positive in both Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets as well. We improved our competitive positioning against all providers. We continue to build out C-Band as we said earlier and -- in suburban and rural markets and we see further opportunity there. And as Hans mentioned, we have strong momentum in the VBG side as well on both mobility and FWA. So, good results. And then, on your question on service revenue, so we feel really good about the shape of service revenue in 2024. The guidance that we gave of 2% to 3.5% reflects accelerated growth, and we talked about the jump off point of 1.3% in the prepared remarks. The midpoint of our guidance range implies over $2 billion of service revenue growth. If we think about the assumptions in the guide, in terms of tailwinds, as you know, we've executed a number of pricing actions, both in the back half of 2023 that do carry into 2024, as well as in recent weeks, we've taken further pricing actions in both Consumer and Business that will provide a tailwind. We also have an improving volume profile in our Consumer business. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive phone net adds in Consumer in 2024 and stable Business volumes as well. And then, the third tailwind I'd point to is an increasing contribution from fixed wireless access. We have really good momentum and over 3 million subs in the base. In terms of headwinds, prepaid has been a drag on service revenue both in the fourth quarter and the full year. It was about $142 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect the prepaid headwinds continue into 2024 as we stabilize that business. And then on promo amortization, that continues to be a headwind with the increase in 2024 similar to the increase we experienced in 2023. But when you put that all together, we like the trajectory of service revenue.\nJohn Hodulik: That's great detail. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yes, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Just following up there on the fixed wireless, could you just give us a little bit of color around how the churn is performing? What are you seeing in terms of those cohorts that have had the service for some time? And any comments on sort of capacity and so forth? And also, are you seeing emerging seasonality in this product driven by strong back-to-school in Q3 and then maybe a little bit softer in Q4? And then, anything you can -- color you can provide on your exposure to ACP and how that may affect you and your latest thoughts on the BEAD program? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. Thank you. On the fixed wireless access, I think the product is maturing. We're now past 3 million subs, both on the Business side and Consumer together. Clearly, the rollout and the product is unique. It has -- it resonates so good in the market, the simplicity of the product and installing it, which was our idea. And even if we took out the discount that we had in the third quarter, we haven't seen any slowdown. The product is resonating so well. We are constantly improving it. The NPS is really high on the product. And as I said so many times before, for us is to keep the same volume right now because that we are dimensioning our capacity, our capital in the best way, it's the most efficient way. So, we will continue to be in these levels, and we think they're very important. And topping that, of course, that -- our consumers using fixed wireless access that they are using the network as anybody else. And as I said before, we have dimensioned the network to handle it, so that's not the challenge. And the most important for us is that we have fiberized all our network, and so we can transport all the data. The guys are doing great job on fixed wireless access across the board.\nTony Skiadas: Yeah. And then just one additional point there. So, the longer-dated churn, Simon, is very strong, and we're very pleased with the progress thus far. On your other question, on ACP, just maybe a few points to make here. The guidance assumes that the ACP funding remains intact. In the event the funding goes away, we have plans to address it and we'll see what happens there. The majority of the exposure on ACP is in our prepaid business. We have about 1.2 million prepaid subs that benefit from the ACP program, and that's less than 10% of our prepaid base. On the postpaid side, we have minimal exposure to ACP, both Fios and postpaid wireless. And the margin exposure from ACP is very, very small.\nHans Vestberg: And on the BEAD program, we will participate when that comes out in the market where we see we can compete and where we see a good return on investment. We have already won a couple in the early stages, but we expect that this will roll out over years to come. And -- but again, we will see that we participate when it makes sense for us usually -- or not usually, always with financial discipline.\nSimon Flannery: Great. And just one follow-up. On the fiber build, is that again about 500,000 homes passed this year?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah, Simon, it will be a little bit over 400,000 next year.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks so much.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Simon. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, thank you. I think you said you expect postpaid phone positive for the year. What's the durability of consumer growth? Could that also be positive for 2024? And remind us the impact that price increases tend to have on churn over the last couple of years. And then second, maybe you could just dig into where your gross adds are coming from, the improvements as you're doing better there? Churn has sort of been in-line, but gross add is doing a lot better. If you could dig into that? Is there any significant shift in where customers are coming from, maybe from the myPlan? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Sure. I can just start by saying, but I'm going to hand it over to Tony, I think you're spot on. On myPlan, and I said it in my opening remarks, stellar performance so far on myPlan. But it's not only that the plan is good, it's both flexible, you have cost control and our customers get value of it. And I think that goes back to the what I talked about for years, disciplined approach, but also very segmented. And that's what's happening right now, and we can see that we allocate money to the right product, to the right customer in the right market. So, there's a lot of that. But Tony will give you a little bit of rundown on the numbers.\nTony Skiadas: Sure. So, just, Phil, on the churn, I mean, obviously, we'll see a little bit of an uptick from the pricing changes we made in both Consumer and in Business, and those changes were announced in the last few weeks. And then, as Hans mentioned, we really had good performance in Consumer. You saw the gross add number at 17% and 10% for the full year, and that's despite being in a much lower upgrade environment as well. So, we feel really good. Like I said earlier, the Tier 1 markets were very strong and we see further opportunity as we build out C-Band. The churn profile is much better. The ARPA is much better. So, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing so far with C-Band and the performance.\nPhil Cusick: And in terms of the durability of postpaid and growth there?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah. Look, we said we're going to be postpaid phone positive in Consumer in 2024, and we'll also continue to see strong momentum in Business as well. We did 562,000 net adds this year, and Kyle and the team did a great job, and we expect continued solid growth from the Business side as well.\nPhil Cusick: That's great. Thanks for everything, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open, sir.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Good morning. Just one more on wireless pricing. Can you provide some additional context on how you're seeing the competitive landscape evolve with respect to pricing, and how Verizon is trying to balance the volume versus price equation as you look out from the recent pricing actions that you've taken? And then second, can you provide an update on how much the cost-cutting program yielded in '23, and how much you can capture it in '24 relative to the previously articulated target? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Mike. I think when it comes to our pricing and our promotions, I think we look more about we are the leader in the market. We look at the different segments we have to see that we have the right offerings for right customer with the right value. That's the focus we have had for, I would say, the last two years, very much focused on our customer base and the consumers and the customers we can attract to Verizon. And so far, that disciplined approach we have. You saw the fourth quarter, for example, we invested a little bit more because we have really good momentum. So sometimes, we're going to invest more, but it's always going to be with return on investment in mind to see that we're doing the right for all our stakeholders. So that's the focus we'll have on the pricing we have both on broadband and on wireless. On the cost program, '23 was a big year for us. You're probably following all our press releases, but we did a lot in customer care. We did a lot with the managed services with outsourcing with HCL. We implemented some really large IT systems and application that's going to be a fantastic platform. We continue to deploy our offshore centers and being even stronger using that as a platform on the basis that we created the Verizon Global Services, the 1st of January '23. So, I'm really pleased with the platforms, and that means we're on track for the savings we talked about going into '24, it's more about the same. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Sure. So, just to add a couple of things here. So, on 2023, we delivered about $300 million to $400 million in savings. And as Hans mentioned, we expect the program to ramp in 2024 and the savings are contemplated in the guide. A portion will hit the bottom-line while also giving us the flexibility to invest in the business. And I think you saw that in the fourth quarter and the results speak for themselves. We're not going to give specific cost targets, but what -- in addition to what Hans mentioned, we have work going on in IT platform transformation, real estate and fleet optimization, and we're also opening up a shared service center in Ireland. So, we feel really good about the cost actions that are driving the EBITDA improvements that you see in the guidance for this year.\nMichael Rollins: And just one other. Where are you in process of restructuring the Business wireline operations? And how close are you to an inflection where that segment can stabilize financially or potentially eventually grow at some point? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Mike. No, that's a big focus for us. We have the secular decline, and we've had that for quite a while. So, there's nothing new and nothing new to that story. But our cost efficiency is, of course, happening very, very quickly, and the team is doing a great job. Not only that, we also see that we have the right pricing for our customers and also seen where we don't have great contract, we have decided to walk away from them. So, very much tackling -- blocking and tackling to see that we'll continue to improve. And of course, our target is to get that to sort of being neutral to our P&L over time. And that is one of the important pieces for getting the 25% of the Verizon Business Group in EBITDA. But not only that, of course, we're offsetting that by growing our wireless business and our broadband business. So, typical management of product portfolio, and I would say Kyle and the team is doing a great job with the full support from Tony and me.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. So, you made a lot of changes in the last year to kind of retail marketing to correct some of the past periods. You now got a new CMO. What can we expect her to be doing differently? Should we see this as another reset or change of direction? How should we think about that adjustment? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: You're right. Last year, we did a lot of changes. But looking at the result, I think many of the changes was absolutely right, all the way from our structural changes to go-to-market, the product. And also, we did quite a lot of management changes, getting the -- many of the executives in new positions, including then recruiting a new CMO, Leslie Berland. We're excited to have her on. I think where we are with our brand and with our offerings, we're in a great place. But you know you cannot sit still here and that's why we recruited Leslie. Leslie will work with the full team to see how we continue to refine the leadership in the brand, because we are the number one brand in the market. We're just going to refine that, but we're not going to sit still. So, I think Leslie has been here for two weeks. So, I see a lot of great initiatives and ideas, and we will work together with her to make this company even better.\nFrank Louthan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Frank. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple if I could. Just the first, you went out of your way to highlight how well fixed wireless access is doing in the C-Band markets. These are kind of the main markets, probably the densest markets. Obviously, we're going to see the C-Band deployment expand, both in terms of spectrum density and in terms of geography. 350,000 has been kind of the baseline expectation for fixed wireless access adds. In the current C-Band deployment, would you be willing to put a stake in the ground? Where could that go? Could that double by the time we get the full C-Band out there by the end of next year? That's the first question. And I guess the second question, Tony, you gave us the kind of moving parts, the EBITDA growth, 2%, that's about $0.75 billion after tax, interest expense at $0.175, that's about $3 billion -- $0.75 billion after tax, $1.5 billion CapEx savings. So, the big moving part that none of us really know is the cash tax and how that might impact free cash flow, whether free cash flow could be up a little bit, down a little bit. Could you be more transparent around that moving part? Thank you so much.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, David. When it comes to fixed wireless access, yeah, when we got the C-Band, the initial chunk of spectrum we got was in urban places. Now, since the end of third quarter, we got the suburban and rural areas. But we continue at the end of the year to strengthen our urban areas. So, now we are sort of deploying much more in the suburban and rural. That creates a new opportunity for us, both from our strength in wireless in many of those markets together with our fixed wireless access. But I said it many times before, for us, it's very important to have a certain volume and a certain cadence, because we can optimize our resources, our capital, et cetera. So, Tony and I feel really good about being around 400,000 net adds for broadband in total, including Fios. That has sort of been a mantra. They can be, of course, coming up and down a little bit. But it's not like we are forcing a lot of capital and resources in the quarter and then doing less, that's not efficient in a company like ours. We are very financially disciplined, as you know, and that's best for our customers and for our stakeholders like shareholders. So, that's what you're going to expect from us.\nTony Skiadas: And Dave, just on your question on cash taxes, so we said, we're going to be pressured by the phaseout of bonus. We did see a tax benefit in 2023 from the spectrum clearing payments. And if you think about the headwind, we'd see it at about $2 billion right now, and we'll have to see how things play out with what the proposed legislation is.\nDavid Barden: Perfect. Helpful, guys. Thank you so much.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Dave. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. I wonder if you could talk about your market growth expectations for postpaid coming into the year. I know you're the first one to report, so we haven't seen the results from anyone else yet. But what's your sense of what we can expect in terms of total postpaid and maybe total phone growth for 2024 market-wide?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. If I think about this year, I mean, first of all, well, mobility and broadband is two of the most important infrastructure in the country, and I don't think anyone, a company, a person or organization can live without those services. We are the number one in basically everything we're doing. I think it's a healthy industry. It's an important product we have, then it can come up and down. So, I cannot give you a percentage what's going to happen. I think our offering is great. I think the product is so important, both mobility and broadband for all parts of our society. I wouldn't like to be in any other business, and it's sort of so important for our society that mobility and broadband is working.\nCraig Moffett: Can I just maybe drill down a little bit though? I mean, the growth numbers we've seen have been as high as 6 million-plus. Is that a feasible growth rate? Population growth, including immigration, is more like 3 million. Is your sense as you go into set your own expectations for the year that we'll see some deceleration? Or is your sense that there's still something going on that's keeping growth so far in excess of population growth?\nHans Vestberg: I think that we're going to -- whatever number it's going to be, we're going to get our fair share of it and that's what we are aiming for. But you're right, of course, immigration is lower, so the pool is smaller, but we've also seen a really good uptake between value segment to postpaid. So, there's a lot of factors coming in. And then of course, what we have done, when I think about offerings, we have myPlan. We're adding the perks, for example, the Netflix and Max. We are expanding also ARPA because we have such a great offering to our customers. So, this is a new time. But again, the product is so important for the market and for each and every one of us. So, I feel really good about coming into this year, what we have done and where we have got, and let's see where we end up.\nCraig Moffett: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Craig. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open, sir.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So maybe a couple. I guess, firstly, on the fiber side, Hans, as you think about the base of fixed wireless subscribers, by next year, you'll have a pretty big critical mass overall of 5 million-plus potentially. And it's not too far away from where your Fios base is. And you have BEAD money coming in. Potentially there's more interest from private equity funds and so on and so forth. And I know you've talked about being a lot more disciplined on fiber, but does your breakeven threshold change just given the kind of critical mass you get to in fixed wireless and also the kind of capital alternatives that we are starting to see in the market? That's one. And secondly, on the wireless side, over the last two or three years, I mean, obviously there's been pretty big tailwind to service revenue from prices and explicit price increases. So, your thoughts on how long that can continue and when does mix take over and become a bigger component overall from a service revenue growth perspective, and how we should expect that transition to happen would be helpful. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Kannan. I have to go back a little bit when it comes to our broadband strategy. We have a multipurpose network. We're building networks once and we have multiple options at the edge. That was sort of the infancy of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. From the data center to the edge, we have harmonized everything, we have fiber in between everything, we have multi-routers, we have one transport network, that is super important. It's sort of the brain of the network. Then, at the edge, we have optionality, what type of access we have. In the ILEC, of course, we're going to continue with our success in Fios, and outside we're doing fixed wireless access. But it gave us optionality over time. I like owner's economics. I think that, that makes us very competitive in pricing and offerings to our customers. There are, of course, a lot offerings from people that want to ship in capital, but ultimately, it has paid off for us to be very, very prudent in financial discipline with our own money. But you can never out-rule, but that's really my view on it. But I'm creating optionality with the network, and Joe and his team are super agile if we need to be within that. On the wireless, I would say, I mean, if you look at our Business side, they have great offerings in the market. They have taken the fair share over 10 quarters, and then have also made new offerings so they can expand. So, I think they both have done quantity and value. And wireless, of course, on the Consumer side, they have historically had more ARPA increase with new offerings, new pricing, new products rather than volumes, but you have seen us performing in the last part of the year. And I think Sampath and his team, they have said that they want to increase their part of getting new customers. But again, it will be financial discipline, and we should get the right customers. And if you look at our quality of our consumer base, it's just amazing, and we will continue to be financially prudent on that, but clearly, we want to have more volumes, and -- but not to any cost. We will do it with the right cost and the right product to our customers.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Kannan. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Sir, please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Supino: Hi, thanks. Good morning. On the subject of consumption and network utilization, I wondered if you could update us on the number of gigabytes per month that postpaid phone customers are consuming nowadays. And extending that thought over the next few years, does that growth and the robust FWA business that you're building suggest that we should prepare for densification or other radio access network or spectrum costs for capacity over the next several years, certainly not a 2024 question? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. I'll come back to how we build the network, because building the network is so important, because the biggest challenge with a lot of traffic is, of course, transporting it in efficient way, having your own fiber, and that we've already built. When it comes to the growth in the network, yeah, everybody is using the network more. There's no difference between fixed wireless access and Fios. And of course, wireless consumers are using the network more as well. But we have built a very stable network all the way from the data centers to the edge. And then, of course, we have assets that nobody else have. We have a lot of our traffic on millimeter wave, which is the cheapest way to deliver data in the market by far. And we have our C-Band years coming out, so -- and we have our best engineers. So, I feel really good with that people and customers are using our network more. That's what this was intended for, and we have designed it like that. So...\nPeter Supino: Great. Thanks, Peter.\nBrady Connor: Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I had two, if I could. First, following up on John's earlier question, can you give us a sense for how much of the year-over-year improvement in gross adds in the fourth quarter was the result of healthy industry volumes versus the improved execution and product that you've got in the market now? And, additionally on that, did you see stronger performance in December versus the rest of the quarter? I ask because I think your last public presentation was in early December and your results seemed even more positive than your tone back then. So, it seems like maybe you picked up momentum as the quarter progressed. And then, I just had a separate question on the issue of lead cables. I was wondering if you would comment on the latest media report that the EPA has conducted its own testing near some of your lead sheath cables that have shown lead levels above the EPA standard for safety. Any sense for whether these reports are accurate? And if so, how you're thinking about the potential impact at this point around this issue? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. Thank you, Bryan. Let me start with the market in the fourth quarter. We don't know. I mean, the others haven't reported. We only know that we have performed really well. And -- but that has been -- it's not the one-quarter phenomena. If you think about from the second quarter, third quarter, even in the first quarter, we were sequentially improving all the time, and we have done that in a very disciplined ways with a lot of actions, and that we need to keep up. And then, the comment on how the quarter shaped, so you probably talk about Consumer more than anything else. I think we're solid through the quarter. There was nothing sort of different in -- during the month in the quarter. We were solid through the quarter doing well performance. On the lead, as I said before, we take that very seriously. I cannot comment what media doing. We work with all the agencies to see that we are following this up and we have revealed all the information we have, so we don't have any more. We have also disclosed how much lead cable we have in the network, which is very little. But again, we take it serious and work with all the agencies.\nBryan Kraft: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Bryan. Hey, Brad, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Your line is open, sir.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Hey, Hans, this is -- I apologize, probably the fourth time you're coming back to the gross add question. But I think earlier you made mention of kind of the change in structure from nationalization to localization. I think that was something that Sampath has had kind of stated as one of his specific things and probably something that maybe could be more sustainable than just a change in a rate plan that obviously could be replicated or just addresses the market. So, just a couple of questions on that. First, if you think about kind of the ramp in fourth quarter, I know this is kind of a soft question, but like the impact of localization and that change in the structure of the sales organization versus myPlan, which had a larger impact? And then, I guess more importantly, the sustainability, meaning that, yeah, you typically do see sequential growth seasonally around this time of year, obviously more pronounced this year than past, but are we going to see even more sequential growth or more abnormal growth in the first half of the year as some of the implementation of that localization continues, or have we largely already seen that impact as we go into 2024? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Hey, Walt, I think that was -- it's a good question. So, the whole -- we started -- remember, we started with the network. As the C-Band, it's sort of rolling out in different ZIP codes all the time, we are engaging locally. The same we did with the Consumer group to be much more local, to be able to do local marketing, cater for what the local market, have local flavors of our marketing. We worked with the sports league like NFL and the teams in different markets to see that happen. So, of course, I'm going to attribute part of our growth during the year to the decentralization. But we just got started to see that we have that team in place, and Sampat and the team are working with them with these market precedents to make it. But it's also a sign of where the market is going. You need to be local and you need to be on the ground in the different societies in order to perform and be acknowledged, and Verizon is most visible in all the grounds, and now we're taking next step with our structure. So, very pleased with what I've seen so far, but more to be done.\nTony Skiadas: Yeah, Walt, just to add on to what Hans said, the regional structure is a lot closer to the customer, and we've run the business this way for many, many years. And we can do things like different promos for different markets and local resources, and decision making and the localization offset some of the price ups as well. So, we feel really good about where we're heading, especially with the Tier 2 and Tier 3 rollouts with C-Band and the opportunity that provides.\nWalter Piecyk: Tony, can you also remind us when the Board considers share repurchase as it relates to leverage? And I think the leverage that you mentioned earlier in the call, excludes the unsecured debt, because you were referencing a 2.6 number. So, assuming we're basing it off the 2.6 number, I think your long-term target was 2.0 times. So, clearly, you wouldn't let it go below 2.0 times before you start buying stock back. But is there a consideration under 2.5 times where the Board starts to consider share repurchase? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Walt. I think this is something that we have been very disciplined. Our capital allocation priorities are clear. Number one, money to the business, basically our CapEx. Number two, continue to put the Board in a place where they can continue to increase our dividend. And number three, paying down debt. When we come down to 2.25 times, we have said we will start considering buybacks, but our ultimate long-term goal is to get around 2 times. So, yeah, that's the plan. But of course, it will play in where the market is, where the interest rates are, where the capital, and where the equities. But clearly, that's the plan we have right now and the Board is fully tuned to that plan.\nWalter Piecyk: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Walt. Brad, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I hope you all had a great start of 2024. I'm pleased to report that Verizon closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, finishing off a year of solid operation and financial performance. For us, 2023 was a year of continuous improvement and important actions across the business. We made significant changes to how we operate and to our team, and those changes paid off. We stabilized our core business and positioned the company for renewed growth and profitability. We built strong momentum quarter after quarter, culminating in a very good holiday season. And finally, we met the guidance that we provided to you in each of our key performance indicators. Entering 2024, Verizon stands ready to further unlock our performance potential at an accelerating rate. We now have all the assets, the best team in the business, and a focus on continued operational excellence to deliver even better results going forward. Let me share some full-year highlights with you. Wireless service revenue for 2023 was $76.7 billion, a 3.2% year-over-year increase. We delivered outstanding volumes during a healthy fourth quarter where our customers clearly embraced our offerings. Full-year adjusted EBITDA was $47.8 billion, contributing to a very strong free cash flow of $18.7 billion, reflecting our disciplined and strategic approach to profitable growth. As a result of our financial strength, we raised our dividend for the 17th year in a row with a healthy free cash flow dividend payout ratio of approximately 59%. We also reduced our year-over-year leverage, while continuing to bring CapEx back towards business as usual levels. This aligns with the capital allocation priorities we have shared in recent years. These results provide a solid foundation for Verizon's journey and future success. And I'm pleased that we put the leadership and team in place last year that will serve Verizon stakeholders well in both the short and long term. We as a team have focused on capturing the market opportunity, and I'm proud of our progress in 2023. Just two weeks ago, Leslie Berland joined Verizon as our Chief Marketing Officer. I'm excited to bring her on board and have a great confidence in her ability to continue shaping Verizon's premium brand perception and story. We started 2023 determined to differentiate ourselves by investing even more in profitable growth while transforming Verizon to make the company more efficient and effective. Seeing the continued strength of the U.S. consumer, busy holiday store traffic and rising demand for mobility, broadband and private networks, we also took actions to fuel growth during the fourth quarter, and it showed in our results. A standout milestone in 2023 was our launch of myPlan, which was designed from extensive customer research to be the most flexible plan available to U.S. consumers from any wireless company. myPlan has been a great success that has seen stellar adoption. Introduced in May, we already have 13.1 million myPlan subscribers. And these customers using premium packages and our unique perks driving ARPA. Other changes we made in 2023 include establishing a regional distribution model, tailoring our approach to every market, revamping sales composition to support productivity and introducing new price plans and promotions in Consumer and Business. Verizon Business also partnered with HCLTech to be more efficient to deliver post-sale implementation and customer support for managed network services, enhancing our customer service while saving Verizon money. These actions paired with all of our assets sets us up very well for 2024. We are now working from an effective model and this is just the start. Overall, the wireless industry is strong as we head into 2024, and we are confident in our strategy. We have great offerings with optionality to meet the needs of customers of any budget on the best network in the country. Now, let me share a bit more how each of our service performed in the fourth quarter. Starting with mobility. We had 449,000 postpaid phone net adds, driven by improving net adds in Consumer and a continued sustainable performance in Verizon Business. Our disciplined and segmented market approach is working with customers and creating great economics for our shareholders. In Consumer, you can see the pattern of continuous improvements from the start of the year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered our best postpaid phone gross adds performance since 2019 and our best net adds in two years. We added 318,000 postpaid phone customers in the fourth quarter and our gross adds were up almost 17% year-over-year. It is clear that we have momentum in Consumer as we move into 2024, and we'll continue to work to get our fair share on new business. Our customer-centric offers are resonating in the market, and we're just getting started. By leveraging Verizon's large subscriber base and key partnership, we can deliver exclusive discount offers like Netflix and Max for just $10 a month, underscoring our industry leadership in value-driven content offerings. With our vast network coverage and the largest base of loyal customers, we're uniquely positioned to provide targeted high-value deals that deepen relationship across connected devices, streaming and more. Within the value business, which includes our prepaid offerings like TracFone, Visible and Total by Verizon, we still have work to do but are making progress. Moving to Verizon Business. The team continued to deliver on mobility with total postpaid phone net adds of 131,000 for the fourth quarter 2023, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of postpaid phone net adds above 125,000. For the full year, Business added 562,000 phone net adds, an outstanding result. Our Business customers are prioritizing mobility and value the optionality we offer with highly-tailored plans on the best network in the country. Now, let's turn to broadband. For the year, we had more than 1.7 million broadband net adds, with more than 1.5 million net adds from fixed wireless access and 248,000 net adds from Fios, a nice increase over 2022. On fixed wireless access, we're consistently adding more than 350,000 subscribers per quarter, which is part of our plan for steady, sustainable growth that exceeds what we expected at launch. Just three years of the launch, we serve more than 3 million fixed wireless access customers, well ahead of our stated goal of 4 million to 5 million subscribers by the end of 2025. With fixed wireless access, we're expanding into new markets and proving the value of Verizon's connectivity. Customers are finding strong reliability and speed in fixed wireless access and that shows in our results, including a very strong Net Promoter Score. For a product that still is in the beginning, the pace of adoption has the team super excited. We expect this will be a long-term source of recurring revenue for Verizon, and we're entering this year with a strong base for continued growth. Turning to the private networks and our 5G business solutions. We continue to see interest from large enterprises running complex logistics and operations like ports, automotive and heavy industries. In November, Norfolk International Terminal contracted us to build a second private 5G network for them. Audi, already one of our partners in smart car development, has contracted us to build a private network for their automotive tech testing environment. And Nucor, one of the country's largest steel companies, has us building private networks for three of its sites with more to come over the next year. Strategically, we're building a new source of revenue expansion where we are the clear leader. Last year, we also expanded existing 5G private networks partnerships with NFL to bring new spectator and retail experience to fans everywhere. When we build relationships with these large enterprises and they see what our network can do for them, there is always potential for more business. And our network is just getting better and better every day. With full access to our spectrum as of the end of third quarter last year, our mission is to optimize the experience in every market and expand into suburban and rural markets, where we know our consumer and business customers are eager to take up our offerings. We have been expanding and improving our network in key markets through 2023 and into this year. I have said it before and I will say it again, our network is the foundation how we offer the best value and premium experience to our customers. And we're now seeing our investment in C-Band paying off in terms of customer experience and loyalty. Where we have C-Band, we see higher gross adds, lower churn and more step ups to premium services. We also see increased uptake of customers taking both mobility and broadband services. Meanwhile, millimeter wave, which we have now deployed in many urban areas and all 30 NFL stadiums, sets Verizon apart with an outstanding performance at high density areas and public event spaces. And for the 32nd consecutive time, Verizon was the most awarded company in the country for wireless network quality, with the first place rankings in each of J.D. Power's six regions. We are the network that America relies on, and we take that commitment very seriously. Looking ahead, our priorities for 2024 are crystal clear. We remain laser-focused on growing wireless service revenue and expanding our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to allow for a meaningful debt reduction in the year ahead. This is what our whole team is working towards and what you, our shareholders, and our Board want us to focus on. Tony will have more details for you, but we anticipate strong wireless service revenue growth of 2% to 3.5% in 2024, which reflects our ability to sustain the top-line of our business as we continue to pursue the right balance of profitability and customer growth. Our adjusted EBITDA profile will continue to improve as we become even more efficient with growth, cost saving measures and our disciplined promotional spending. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And as we lower our capital intensity from the C-Band build out and our new business structure, we expect to see continued strong free cash flow generation going forward. That will enable our Board to continue to raise our dividend and also enable us to bring down leverage. Now, Tony will discuss the quarter as well as our operations and guidance in more detail. Thank you, Tony. As you heard today, we're confident and well positioned to deliver a solid 2024. Thanks to our best-in-class network, which is only getting better, we offer the mobile and broadband services that customer value and need the most. Our industry is critical to the next wave of innovation, and Verizon is ready to capitalize on the opportunity of the AI economy to bring this technology to life for all our stakeholders. As I said in the beginning, we have the right team in place to execute the next chapter in Verizon's history. I'm proud of the work our team accomplished in 2023 and excited what we will deliver in 2024. Our results in C-Band markets speaks for themselves and support our investment decisions, and we're going to lean in further as we expand into suburban and rural markets while maintaining the financial discipline you come to expect from us. We will continue to stay very close to our customers to understand their needs and preferences, so that we can offer the right promotions at the right times in the right markets. We have the right people, the right assets and the right strategy. Our focus for 2024 is on execution. It's a winning combination, and we are very confident heading into this year. Finally, I want to remind you that we are hosting an investor event on February 5 and encourage everyone to tune in to the webcast. Given the financial update today, next month will be more of an operational and strategic update on the company. Now, Brady, we're ready to take questions. Hey, John, thank you for the question. So, let me start about the subs then. On the Business side, 10th quarter in a row, more than 125,000. Kyle and his team is doing a great job. We are -- our network is performing so well, so our customers just continue to buy in with us. Not only that, our offerings in our go-to-market is as strong as ever. So, we feel really good about what Kyle and his team is doing. On the Consumer side, yeah, we had a good fourth quarter, but you have seen also through the year that we have sequentially improved all the time. Everything started where we started with a new offering, myPlan, which resonates with the market, very much consumer insights in it. Then on top of that, Sampath has done a lot of changes in our structure, all the way from the go-to-market, the incentives in our stores and our decentralization of it. So, it hangs together all the way. So, I think the most important, we have the right offerings in the market and that has really resonated on the Consumer side. So, I'm really happy with the team. We will continue to execute on the plan we have and we have started. Okay. Thank you. On the fixed wireless access, I think the product is maturing. We're now past 3 million subs, both on the Business side and Consumer together. Clearly, the rollout and the product is unique. It has -- it resonates so good in the market, the simplicity of the product and installing it, which was our idea. And even if we took out the discount that we had in the third quarter, we haven't seen any slowdown. The product is resonating so well. We are constantly improving it. The NPS is really high on the product. And as I said so many times before, for us is to keep the same volume right now because that we are dimensioning our capacity, our capital in the best way, it's the most efficient way. So, we will continue to be in these levels, and we think they're very important. And topping that, of course, that -- our consumers using fixed wireless access that they are using the network as anybody else. And as I said before, we have dimensioned the network to handle it, so that's not the challenge. And the most important for us is that we have fiberized all our network, and so we can transport all the data. The guys are doing great job on fixed wireless access across the board. And on the BEAD program, we will participate when that comes out in the market where we see we can compete and where we see a good return on investment. We have already won a couple in the early stages, but we expect that this will roll out over years to come. And -- but again, we will see that we participate when it makes sense for us usually -- or not usually, always with financial discipline. Sure. I can just start by saying, but I'm going to hand it over to Tony, I think you're spot on. On myPlan, and I said it in my opening remarks, stellar performance so far on myPlan. But it's not only that the plan is good, it's both flexible, you have cost control and our customers get value of it. And I think that goes back to the what I talked about for years, disciplined approach, but also very segmented. And that's what's happening right now, and we can see that we allocate money to the right product, to the right customer in the right market. So, there's a lot of that. But Tony will give you a little bit of rundown on the numbers. Thanks, Mike. I think when it comes to our pricing and our promotions, I think we look more about we are the leader in the market. We look at the different segments we have to see that we have the right offerings for right customer with the right value. That's the focus we have had for, I would say, the last two years, very much focused on our customer base and the consumers and the customers we can attract to Verizon. And so far, that disciplined approach we have. You saw the fourth quarter, for example, we invested a little bit more because we have really good momentum. So sometimes, we're going to invest more, but it's always going to be with return on investment in mind to see that we're doing the right for all our stakeholders. So that's the focus we'll have on the pricing we have both on broadband and on wireless. On the cost program, '23 was a big year for us. You're probably following all our press releases, but we did a lot in customer care. We did a lot with the managed services with outsourcing with HCL. We implemented some really large IT systems and application that's going to be a fantastic platform. We continue to deploy our offshore centers and being even stronger using that as a platform on the basis that we created the Verizon Global Services, the 1st of January '23. So, I'm really pleased with the platforms, and that means we're on track for the savings we talked about going into '24, it's more about the same. Tony? Thank you, Mike. No, that's a big focus for us. We have the secular decline, and we've had that for quite a while. So, there's nothing new and nothing new to that story. But our cost efficiency is, of course, happening very, very quickly, and the team is doing a great job. Not only that, we also see that we have the right pricing for our customers and also seen where we don't have great contract, we have decided to walk away from them. So, very much tackling -- blocking and tackling to see that we'll continue to improve. And of course, our target is to get that to sort of being neutral to our P&L over time. And that is one of the important pieces for getting the 25% of the Verizon Business Group in EBITDA. But not only that, of course, we're offsetting that by growing our wireless business and our broadband business. So, typical management of product portfolio, and I would say Kyle and the team is doing a great job with the full support from Tony and me. You're right. Last year, we did a lot of changes. But looking at the result, I think many of the changes was absolutely right, all the way from our structural changes to go-to-market, the product. And also, we did quite a lot of management changes, getting the -- many of the executives in new positions, including then recruiting a new CMO, Leslie Berland. We're excited to have her on. I think where we are with our brand and with our offerings, we're in a great place. But you know you cannot sit still here and that's why we recruited Leslie. Leslie will work with the full team to see how we continue to refine the leadership in the brand, because we are the number one brand in the market. We're just going to refine that, but we're not going to sit still. So, I think Leslie has been here for two weeks. So, I see a lot of great initiatives and ideas, and we will work together with her to make this company even better. Thank you, David. When it comes to fixed wireless access, yeah, when we got the C-Band, the initial chunk of spectrum we got was in urban places. Now, since the end of third quarter, we got the suburban and rural areas. But we continue at the end of the year to strengthen our urban areas. So, now we are sort of deploying much more in the suburban and rural. That creates a new opportunity for us, both from our strength in wireless in many of those markets together with our fixed wireless access. But I said it many times before, for us, it's very important to have a certain volume and a certain cadence, because we can optimize our resources, our capital, et cetera. So, Tony and I feel really good about being around 400,000 net adds for broadband in total, including Fios. That has sort of been a mantra. They can be, of course, coming up and down a little bit. But it's not like we are forcing a lot of capital and resources in the quarter and then doing less, that's not efficient in a company like ours. We are very financially disciplined, as you know, and that's best for our customers and for our stakeholders like shareholders. So, that's what you're going to expect from us. Thank you, Craig. If I think about this year, I mean, first of all, well, mobility and broadband is two of the most important infrastructure in the country, and I don't think anyone, a company, a person or organization can live without those services. We are the number one in basically everything we're doing. I think it's a healthy industry. It's an important product we have, then it can come up and down. So, I cannot give you a percentage what's going to happen. I think our offering is great. I think the product is so important, both mobility and broadband for all parts of our society. I wouldn't like to be in any other business, and it's sort of so important for our society that mobility and broadband is working. I think that we're going to -- whatever number it's going to be, we're going to get our fair share of it and that's what we are aiming for. But you're right, of course, immigration is lower, so the pool is smaller, but we've also seen a really good uptake between value segment to postpaid. So, there's a lot of factors coming in. And then of course, what we have done, when I think about offerings, we have myPlan. We're adding the perks, for example, the Netflix and Max. We are expanding also ARPA because we have such a great offering to our customers. So, this is a new time. But again, the product is so important for the market and for each and every one of us. So, I feel really good about coming into this year, what we have done and where we have got, and let's see where we end up. Thank you, Kannan. I have to go back a little bit when it comes to our broadband strategy. We have a multipurpose network. We're building networks once and we have multiple options at the edge. That was sort of the infancy of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. From the data center to the edge, we have harmonized everything, we have fiber in between everything, we have multi-routers, we have one transport network, that is super important. It's sort of the brain of the network. Then, at the edge, we have optionality, what type of access we have. In the ILEC, of course, we're going to continue with our success in Fios, and outside we're doing fixed wireless access. But it gave us optionality over time. I like owner's economics. I think that, that makes us very competitive in pricing and offerings to our customers. There are, of course, a lot offerings from people that want to ship in capital, but ultimately, it has paid off for us to be very, very prudent in financial discipline with our own money. But you can never out-rule, but that's really my view on it. But I'm creating optionality with the network, and Joe and his team are super agile if we need to be within that. On the wireless, I would say, I mean, if you look at our Business side, they have great offerings in the market. They have taken the fair share over 10 quarters, and then have also made new offerings so they can expand. So, I think they both have done quantity and value. And wireless, of course, on the Consumer side, they have historically had more ARPA increase with new offerings, new pricing, new products rather than volumes, but you have seen us performing in the last part of the year. And I think Sampath and his team, they have said that they want to increase their part of getting new customers. But again, it will be financial discipline, and we should get the right customers. And if you look at our quality of our consumer base, it's just amazing, and we will continue to be financially prudent on that, but clearly, we want to have more volumes, and -- but not to any cost. We will do it with the right cost and the right product to our customers. Yeah. I'll come back to how we build the network, because building the network is so important, because the biggest challenge with a lot of traffic is, of course, transporting it in efficient way, having your own fiber, and that we've already built. When it comes to the growth in the network, yeah, everybody is using the network more. There's no difference between fixed wireless access and Fios. And of course, wireless consumers are using the network more as well. But we have built a very stable network all the way from the data centers to the edge. And then, of course, we have assets that nobody else have. We have a lot of our traffic on millimeter wave, which is the cheapest way to deliver data in the market by far. And we have our C-Band years coming out, so -- and we have our best engineers. So, I feel really good with that people and customers are using our network more. That's what this was intended for, and we have designed it like that. So... Yeah. Thank you, Bryan. Let me start with the market in the fourth quarter. We don't know. I mean, the others haven't reported. We only know that we have performed really well. And -- but that has been -- it's not the one-quarter phenomena. If you think about from the second quarter, third quarter, even in the first quarter, we were sequentially improving all the time, and we have done that in a very disciplined ways with a lot of actions, and that we need to keep up. And then, the comment on how the quarter shaped, so you probably talk about Consumer more than anything else. I think we're solid through the quarter. There was nothing sort of different in -- during the month in the quarter. We were solid through the quarter doing well performance. On the lead, as I said before, we take that very seriously. I cannot comment what media doing. We work with all the agencies to see that we are following this up and we have revealed all the information we have, so we don't have any more. We have also disclosed how much lead cable we have in the network, which is very little. But again, we take it serious and work with all the agencies. Hey, Walt, I think that was -- it's a good question. So, the whole -- we started -- remember, we started with the network. As the C-Band, it's sort of rolling out in different ZIP codes all the time, we are engaging locally. The same we did with the Consumer group to be much more local, to be able to do local marketing, cater for what the local market, have local flavors of our marketing. We worked with the sports league like NFL and the teams in different markets to see that happen. So, of course, I'm going to attribute part of our growth during the year to the decentralization. But we just got started to see that we have that team in place, and Sampat and the team are working with them with these market precedents to make it. But it's also a sign of where the market is going. You need to be local and you need to be on the ground in the different societies in order to perform and be acknowledged, and Verizon is most visible in all the grounds, and now we're taking next step with our structure. So, very pleased with what I've seen so far, but more to be done. Thank you, Walt. I think this is something that we have been very disciplined. Our capital allocation priorities are clear. Number one, money to the business, basically our CapEx. Number two, continue to put the Board in a place where they can continue to increase our dividend. And number three, paying down debt. When we come down to 2.25 times, we have said we will start considering buybacks, but our ultimate long-term goal is to get around 2 times. So, yeah, that's the plan. But of course, it will play in where the market is, where the interest rates are, where the capital, and where the equities. But clearly, that's the plan we have right now and the Board is fully tuned to that plan."

            "name": "Tony Skiadas",
            "content": "Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Executing on our plan, we finished the year strong and delivered on our financial guidance. We exited the year with good momentum and remain committed to our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In 2023, we set out to improve our operational performance while sustaining financial discipline. Our fourth quarter and full year results confirm that our strategy is working and that we can deliver strong financials and improve key operating metrics. Consumer postpaid phone net adds totaled 318,000 for the quarter, a substantial improvement of 369,000 sequentially and 277,000 compared to the prior year. Our Consumer postpaid phone churn of 0.88% represents a stable result even after we implemented over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023. While we do not provide specific guidance on volumes, we wanted to share a couple of items as we look into 2024. In the first quarter, we are taking additional targeted pricing actions that we expect will result in incremental pressure on Consumer postpaid phone churn in the period. However, we expect to deliver positive Consumer postpaid phone net adds in full year 2024 as we execute on our strategy of growing our subscriber base while being financially disciplined. Postpaid phone gross adds in the quarter were up nearly 17% year-over-year. This represents our best quarterly Consumer gross add performance in four years. Our attractive myPlan offers combined with our segmented approach to the market, regional sales structure and disciplined promotional strategy continued to deliver strong results. Additionally, postpaid upgrades remained lower as compared to the prior year. The Consumer postpaid upgrade rate was 4.4% in the fourth quarter, down 120 basis points year-over-year as a result of approximately 19% fewer upgrades. As Hans said, we continue to see better performance in markets where we have deployed C-Band. In our first 76 C-Band markets, fourth quarter Consumer postpaid phone gross add growth was 8 percentage points better than in non-C-Band markets. Additionally, Consumer postpaid phone churn in C-Band markets was 4 basis points better than in non-C-Band markets. The strong momentum in the quarter combined with the continued deployment of our C-Band network positions us well in 2024. The quality of the business we are writing in Consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive premium plan adoption. The premium take rate in C-Band markets for the quarter was more than 10 percentage points higher than in non-C-Band markets. Consumer ARPA of $134.10 represents an increase of 4.7% year-over-year. This was driven by new customer additions, premium plan adoption and fixed wireless subscriber growth. We expect continued and healthy organic ARPA growth in 2024. Our prepaid results remain challenged in the fourth quarter. This is in part to seasonally weaker national retail sales volumes, which is the primary sales channel for our TracFone brands. We also continue to see pricing pressures from low-end postpaid offerings. Prepaid net losses for the quarter were 289,000. During the quarter, we saw continued strong growth within the Visible and Total by Verizon brands, which we will continue to scale. The team is also focused on our partnerships to improve the performance of the Straight Talk brand. We believe we're taking the right steps to better position our offerings in the market and expect to see some stabilization in 2024. Verizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 131,000 phone net adds, which as Hans mentioned, is our 10th consecutive quarter above 125,000. The Business Markets Group had its best phone net add performance in the last two years, demonstrating how our value proposition is resonating with small and medium businesses. Similar to Consumer, we are taking pricing actions in the first quarter in Business that could result in elevated phone churn in the period. However, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong business volumes in 2024. Moving on to broadband, we delivered 413,000 net additions in the quarter continuing the pace of over 400,000 broadband net adds for the fifth consecutive quarter. We see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless offerings, and we continue to see positive responses from customers regarding the quality and reliability of our services. In fixed wireless, we delivered 375,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to over 3 million subscribers. We launched C-Band in early 2022, and our fixed wireless success in the last two years reflects the strong demand for high-quality broadband and the strength and reliability of our product. Notably, in the fourth quarter, over 80% of our consumer fixed wireless gross adds came from C-Band markets. The growth trajectory for fixed wireless continues to be robust and we are ahead of schedule to achieve our 4 million to 5 million subscriber goal by year-end 2025. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, down 4,000 year-over-year. We are pleased with the success of Fios with strong gross adds and retention, reflecting the quality and overall value of the product. We expect broadband subscriber momentum to extend into 2024 as we continue deployment of our C-Band spectrum, further expand our Fios footprint and bring new products and offers to the market. Let's now look at our financials. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $35.1 billion, down 0.3% year-over-year. This change can be attributed to the wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 2% lower than the prior year as total postpaid upgrades declined by approximately 18%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.4 billion, up 3.2% year-over-year. Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans and growth in fixed wireless access. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduced total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 70 basis points year-over-year as well as promo amortization. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $11.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the prior year. Higher wireless service revenue and the benefits of lower upgrades were more than offset by higher marketing and bad debt expense and ongoing declines in Business wireline revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.2% was relatively flat year-over-year. In 2023, we implemented transformations within our Consumer customer care group as well as Business managed services. We are pleased with what we have achieved this year and our cost saving measures are meeting our expectations. We expect further progress on our cost efficiency program in 2024. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 in the quarter, resulting in full year adjusted EPS of $4.71. Turning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $8.7 billion, bringing the total for 2023 to $37.5 billion. This marks a year-over-year improvement of over $300 million, primarily due to working capital improvements. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.6 billion compared to $7.3 billion in the prior year. The full year CapEx totaled $18.8 billion, which represents a more than $4 billion reduction in capital spending from 2022 as we come down from our peak C-Band spending level. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $4.1 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $18.7 billion, a $4.7 billion increase over the prior year, driven by operational improvements and the lower CapEx spending that we previously noted. We are pleased to have delivered on our guidance of more than $18 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which reflects our balanced and strategic approach to delivering profitable growth. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.4 billion, a $1.6 billion improvement year-over-year. Net unsecured debt increased sequentially primarily due to settling the $3.7 billion in incentive payments to satellite operators for our remaining C-Band spectrum. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times as of the end of the fourth quarter, in-line with the prior two quarters. We expect deleveraging of the balance sheet to accelerate in 2024 as CapEx comes down to BAU levels and we continue to generate strong cash flow. Additionally, we continue to benefit from our approach to managing long-term debt and have only $3.6 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2024. Overall, I'm pleased with our momentum exiting the year and our performance in 2023, delivering an improved operational profile while also meeting our financial guidance. Now, I want to take a few moments to look ahead and walk through our 2024 guidance. Our 2024 guidance demonstrates our expectations for accelerating wireless service revenue growth. As a reminder, the reported 2023 wireless service revenue growth of 3.2% included approximately 190 basis points of benefit from a reallocation of other revenues. Excluding this reallocation, the 2023 wireless service revenue growth was 1.3%. For 2024, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2% and 3.5%. This will be driven by anticipated positive postpaid phone net additions in both Consumer and Business, continued fixed wireless access subscriber growth, further adoption of premium unlimited plans, growth in products and services, and pricing action benefits. We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA to grow by 1% to 3% versus the prior year. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue and the impact of our cost transformation initiatives, partially offset by continued pressure in Business wireline revenues and increased wireless network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.50 to $4.70. As noted, we expected adjusted EBITDA to grow in 2024, offset by certain below-the-line impacts. Specifically, higher interest expense is expected to impact adjusted EPS by $0.16 to $0.19, over 75% of which is driven by the continued reduction in capitalized interest related to the C-Band licenses being placed into service. In addition, EPS is expected to be impacted by approximately $0.07 to $0.09 of higher pension and OPEB expense, primarily due to the expiration of certain credits. This impact will flow through the other income and expense line on our income statement. We expect depreciation and amortization to be relatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24% based on current legislation. As discussed in prior quarters, capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $17 billion and $17.5 billion, down from $18.8 billion in 2023. While we are not providing guidance on 2024 free cash flow, we wanted to provide some additional color to aid with your analysis. Tailwinds to free cash flow will come from our adjusted EBITDA growth outlook as well as the expected $1.5 billion reduction in CapEx in 2024 based on the midpoint of our guided CapEx range. Offsets will be higher interest expense and higher cash taxes. As a reminder, the majority of the higher interest expense relates to reductions in capitalized interest. Such interest was recognized in cash flow from investing prior to placing the C-Band spectrum into service. The higher cash taxes are primarily related to the continued phaseout of bonus depreciation in 2024 based on current legislation. Overall, we expect a strong free cash flow profile that will support our capital allocation priorities and position us for meaningful unsecured debt reduction in 2024, which we expect to come in the latter half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans for his closing thoughts. Hey, John, it's Tony. Good morning. So, just to add on to what Hans mentioned, we did really well in Tier 1 markets. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, about 8 percentage points better, and we were also net add positive in both Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets as well. We improved our competitive positioning against all providers. We continue to build out C-Band as we said earlier and -- in suburban and rural markets and we see further opportunity there. And as Hans mentioned, we have strong momentum in the VBG side as well on both mobility and FWA. So, good results. And then, on your question on service revenue, so we feel really good about the shape of service revenue in 2024. The guidance that we gave of 2% to 3.5% reflects accelerated growth, and we talked about the jump off point of 1.3% in the prepared remarks. The midpoint of our guidance range implies over $2 billion of service revenue growth. If we think about the assumptions in the guide, in terms of tailwinds, as you know, we've executed a number of pricing actions, both in the back half of 2023 that do carry into 2024, as well as in recent weeks, we've taken further pricing actions in both Consumer and Business that will provide a tailwind. We also have an improving volume profile in our Consumer business. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive phone net adds in Consumer in 2024 and stable Business volumes as well. And then, the third tailwind I'd point to is an increasing contribution from fixed wireless access. We have really good momentum and over 3 million subs in the base. In terms of headwinds, prepaid has been a drag on service revenue both in the fourth quarter and the full year. It was about $142 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect the prepaid headwinds continue into 2024 as we stabilize that business. And then on promo amortization, that continues to be a headwind with the increase in 2024 similar to the increase we experienced in 2023. But when you put that all together, we like the trajectory of service revenue. Yeah. And then just one additional point there. So, the longer-dated churn, Simon, is very strong, and we're very pleased with the progress thus far. On your other question, on ACP, just maybe a few points to make here. The guidance assumes that the ACP funding remains intact. In the event the funding goes away, we have plans to address it and we'll see what happens there. The majority of the exposure on ACP is in our prepaid business. We have about 1.2 million prepaid subs that benefit from the ACP program, and that's less than 10% of our prepaid base. On the postpaid side, we have minimal exposure to ACP, both Fios and postpaid wireless. And the margin exposure from ACP is very, very small. Yeah, Simon, it will be a little bit over 400,000 next year. Sure. So, just, Phil, on the churn, I mean, obviously, we'll see a little bit of an uptick from the pricing changes we made in both Consumer and in Business, and those changes were announced in the last few weeks. And then, as Hans mentioned, we really had good performance in Consumer. You saw the gross add number at 17% and 10% for the full year, and that's despite being in a much lower upgrade environment as well. So, we feel really good. Like I said earlier, the Tier 1 markets were very strong and we see further opportunity as we build out C-Band. The churn profile is much better. The ARPA is much better. So, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing so far with C-Band and the performance. Yeah. Look, we said we're going to be postpaid phone positive in Consumer in 2024, and we'll also continue to see strong momentum in Business as well. We did 562,000 net adds this year, and Kyle and the team did a great job, and we expect continued solid growth from the Business side as well. Sure. So, just to add a couple of things here. So, on 2023, we delivered about $300 million to $400 million in savings. And as Hans mentioned, we expect the program to ramp in 2024 and the savings are contemplated in the guide. A portion will hit the bottom-line while also giving us the flexibility to invest in the business. And I think you saw that in the fourth quarter and the results speak for themselves. We're not going to give specific cost targets, but what -- in addition to what Hans mentioned, we have work going on in IT platform transformation, real estate and fleet optimization, and we're also opening up a shared service center in Ireland. So, we feel really good about the cost actions that are driving the EBITDA improvements that you see in the guidance for this year. And Dave, just on your question on cash taxes, so we said, we're going to be pressured by the phaseout of bonus. We did see a tax benefit in 2023 from the spectrum clearing payments. And if you think about the headwind, we'd see it at about $2 billion right now, and we'll have to see how things play out with what the proposed legislation is. Yeah, Walt, just to add on to what Hans said, the regional structure is a lot closer to the customer, and we've run the business this way for many, many years. And we can do things like different promos for different markets and local resources, and decision making and the localization offset some of the price ups as well. So, we feel really good about where we're heading, especially with the Tier 2 and Tier 3 rollouts with C-Band and the opportunity that provides."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website, a detailed review of our third quarter results. You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and good morning, to everyone. I am pleased to share our strong third quarter results making out the quarter with solid growth and improving profitability. It is clear that our strategy is working. In both the consumer and the business groups we are executing a segmented agile strategy that provides value to our customers and our bottom-line.  We have delivered growth in each of areas where on, wireless service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. This is evidence that we have the right strategy and are achieving our results in a financially disciplined way.  Now let me share our financials for the quarter. For the third quarter, wireless service revenue is up 3.9% year-over-year, driven by expanding and deepening our customer relationships. This revenue growth is a key driver for adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion for the quarter which is higher than both Q3 last year and sequentially.  Our year to-date free cash flow of $14.6 billion is already exceeding our full year free cash flow for 2022. Thanks to our focus on high quality revenue growth, disciplined promotion strategy, cost efficiency and CapEx reduction of the recent years of heightened capital-intensity driven by the C-band, and fiber investments.  I'm proud to share that my team and I have taken actions to further our position our financial strengths. Our strong cash generation enabled us to reduce net debt, strengthen our balance sheet, and deliver a higher dividend to our shareholders. We're working to bring our leverage ratio to the pre-Spectrum acquisition levels.  During the third quarter, we paid down $2.6 billion in debt and increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. A current industry record that we take pride in. Our dividend coverage is very healthy. Year to-date our free cash flow dividend payout ratio is approximately 56%, a significant improvement from a year ago.  In summary, in spite of an uncertain economic environment, we are on pace to finish 2023 strong. We are confident that we will deliver on the financial guidance that we issued to you at the start of the year and this morning are announcing higher free cash flow guidance for 2023. Tony will provide you more details in the few moments.  Now, let me share more on how our business units are driving our strategy forward. In the quarter, we delivered on our key growth areas, mobility, broadband and private networks. Thanks to our networks, scale and technology advantages.  In consumer mobility, we achieved sequential and year year-over-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds by continuing to put the customer at the center everything we do rather than engaging in aggressive promotional activity like others in the industry, we're offering our consumers optionality and flexibility to choose how they want to use our products and services.  Our differentiated approach or segmentation, financial discipline is paying off with growth in postpaid phone growth adds and lower promotional cash costs. There is more work to be done, but our responsible approach position us to grow subscribers profitably. Since its launch in May, myPlan continues to deliver a personalized experience, giving our customers the value, choice and control that they want.  During the third quarter,we enhanced myPlan by adding Ultimate Unlimited, a third tier with more value and services, further increasing our premium mix and ARPA growth. This is just one example of the flexibility and speed to market that myPlan provides. And I'm excited about what is to come. Our targeted and segmented market approach also serves as well during the iPhone 15 launch and we continue to execute with an iTunes meeting our customers\u2019 needs while maintaining a disciplined approach.  Our competitive position is now stronger. And we\u2019ve delivered positive consumer postpaid phone net adds in the month of September. We anticipate that momentum will continue as we are on track to exceed our postpaid phone net adds from Q4 of last year.  Postpaid phone shown levels are stable even with our targeted pricing actions throughout the year. We continue to see muted upgrade levels, which is something we are watching carefully and is a trend we expect will continue for the next few quarters.  Turning to business mobility. Verizon Business Group delivered 151,000, phone net ads and reached our ninth consecutive quarter above 125,000. Business in governments continue place an increased emphasis on best-in-class reliable connectivity that only Verizon provides. Across mobility, postpaid phone net adds were 100,000, compared to 8,000 last year. We have the largest customer base in the industry and are still finding new ways to add customers through innovation, service quality and a variety of offerings and partnerships that competitors cannot match.  As we discussed before, we\u2019re seeking the optimal balance between price and quantity that allow us to grow our base profitability. In our value business we have had negative volumes, but I'm encouraged by our quarter-over-quarter improvements. As I\u2019ve said before, the value business is a key part of our growth strategy, and we will continue to invest in it and adjust to the needs of the markets.  As we mentioned last quarter, we believe we're seeing the bottom for prepaid volumes and the team is committed and working daily to grow our value business.  Moving to broadband, we delivered another strong quarter with more than 400,000 new subscribers for the fourth quarter in a row. We finished Q3 with $10.3 million broadband subscribers, up by more than 1.7 million subscribers from a year ago, a 21% increase. Critical to the strengths of this key area is fixed wireless access, something you know we deeply believe in.  Our fixed wireless access net adds of 384,000 continue to be strong even with a recent $10 increase for new bundled customers, further evidence of the demand for our product. Where FWA is available, our customers take it and loving it as seen by the high net promoter score. I'm excited towards the share that on the Fios side we had 72,000 Internet net adds for the quarter, up, almost 20% year-over-year and one or best performances in seven years.  Fios remains a coveted, high quality service and we continue to take share and deliver strong numbers even in a lower mover environment. When it comes to private networks, we demand for the product continue to grow, especially those solutions built with licensed spectrum, which provides a more secure and differentiated experience for the end-users.  Businesses are increasingly looking to us for the private network solutions helping to grow our sales funnel and scale the number of installations each quarter.  Let me end by talking about the backbone of our business, our network. During the third quarter, we obtained early access to our remaining C-band spectrum. In urban markets, where C-band is already deployed, we're firing on all cylinders and leveraging its full potential through software upgrades, delivering two to three times more spectrum depth.  As a result, peak speeds go from 9 megabits per second to an amazing 2.4 gigabits per second enabling an even better experience for our customers. You\u2019ve heard me say this before, but let me say it again. C-Band is a game change for our business, giving us better customer attention and step up, as well as a strong broadband opportunity with fixed wireless access.  Every day we see the benefits of our generation investment in C-band spectrum and the impact it will have for our customers for years to come. And our network is winning. This quarter, we received J.D. Power awards in all six US regions, receiving the most awards for wireless network quality for the 31st time in a row.  We have the best networks in the market and we will extend our lead as we complete our C-band deployment, first augmenting urban areas, and next year in suburban and rural markets. This is our key differentiator and the center of everything we do. And we're doing all of this in a responsible way. We're optimizing our network while returning to business as usual levels of CapEx.  We're finding cost efficiencies across our business both as a result of our a new structure, and by emphasizing profitability, when evaluating new opportunities like within business wireline. Our cost efficiency program remains on track to meet our savings goal of $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2025.  Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial and operational performance in more detail. \nTony Skiadas : Thanks, Hans and good morning. Our results for the third quarter continue to demonstrate our progress towards our three priorities, growing wireless service revenue, and driving EBITDA and free cash flow. As Hans said, we are executing on our plan and remain on track to meet our financial guidance for 2023. We've talked about improving our operational performance while maintaining financial discipline with the third quarter results representing another proof point that demonstrates we can deliver improving key metrics and strong financials.  Consumer postpaid phone net losses totaled $51,000 for the quarter, an improvement of $85,000, sequentially and $138,000 compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we executed well in a low switcher environment, enabling postpaid phone gross add growth of 2.3% year-over-year. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.85% represents a stable result even after implementing over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023.  Our segmented approach to the market and the structure and discipline of our promotional strategy helped to deliver strong postpaid phone gross adds and lower postpaid upgrades. The third quarter\u2019s consumer upgrade rate of 3.6% is down 150 basis points year-over-year. The quality of the business we are writing in consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive an elevated premium mix.  Consumer ARPA of $133.47 increased sequentially by 1.2% and year-over-year by 4.5%. We expect to deliver further ARPA growth as a result of the innovations of myPlan, as well as our most recent pricing actions. Verizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 151,000 phone net adds, which as Hans mentioned is our ninth consecutive quarter above 125,000.  While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain and businesses are more cautious than a year ago, mobility continues to be a top investment priority for our Business customers. We expect to continue to deliver strong volumes and expand their relationships by leveraging our position as the wireless market share leader for small and medium businesses, large enterprises and public sector customers.  Moving on to broadband, we delivered 434,000 net additions continuing the pace of over 400,000 net adds for the fourth quarter in a row. Customers are drawn to the quality of our service and overall value proposition for both FWA and Fios. For fixed wireless, gross add expansions grew 384,00 net adds for the quarter growing the base to nearly 2.7 million subscribers.  The addition of the second tranche of C-band spectrum will help us continue our FWA momentum as we work to build a long-term sustainable business. Fios Internet net adds were 72,000, up 11,000 year-over-year.  We are pleased with the success of FiOS with strong gross adds and retention reflecting the quality and overall value of the product. For prepaid, net loss is up $207,000 represents the sequential improvement from the second quarter. We expected a better trajectory for the remainder of the year, as the teams continue to scale some of our key brands such as Visible, and Total by Verizon and execute on our ongoing integration efforts.  Let's now look at our financials. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $33.3 billion, down 2.6% year-over-year. The decline can be attributed to wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 12% lower than the prior year as postpaid upgrades declined 26%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.3 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year and up $217 million sequentially.  Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans and growth and fixed wireless access.  Additionally, as a result of our discipline around promotions and lower upgrade volumes, we saw further reduction in headwinds to service revenue growth associated with promo amortization. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduce total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 60 basis points year-over-year.  Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12.2 billion, an increase of $267 million sequentially and up 0.2%, compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by improved wireless service revenue and lower consumer postpaid upgrades. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items were down approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily due to the lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volumes.  While bad debt is up year-over-year, it was once again flat sequentially consistent with the first half of the year. We continue to make progress on our cost efficiency program, having recently implemented transformations within our consumer, customer care group, as well as business manage services. We are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million of savings in 2023 building momentum to generate incremental savings in 2024.  Adjusted EPS was $1.22 and includes $0.03of pressure from a reduction in capitalized interest due to the early clearance of C-band spectrum. We currently anticipate another incremental $0.03 to $0.04 in the fourth quarter.  Turning the attention to cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was $10.8 billion, bringing the 2023 year-to-date total to $28.8 billion. The year-to-date performance is up approximately $600 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to working capital improvements associated with fewer upgrades and lower inventory levels partially offset by higher interest payments.  Customer payments continue to be healthy with consistent performance throughout the year. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, totaling $14.2 billion year-to-date. At this point, we expect 2023 CapEx to come in at the upper end of our guidance range of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion.  The third quarter was a second consecutive quarter operating at our business as usual runrate. As a result, we would expect a reduction of approximately $4 billion of CapEx in 2023, compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $6.7 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $14.6 billion, a $2.2 billion improvement over the prior year.  As Hans mentioned, we have generated more free cash flow in the first three quarters of this year than in all of 2022. Based on our year-to-date results and the strength of our core business, we are pleased to raise our 2023 free cash flow guidance by $1 billion to more than $18 billion. We are raising guidance even with CapEd at the upper end of our range and absorbing the headwinds from interest expense.  Strong free cash flow provides flexibility and enables us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. As Hans said, within the third quarter, we executed a successful $2.6 billion debt tender, of which a majority was floating rate, while also increasing our dividend once again. Additionally, given our cash position and the performance of the business, this month we paid approximately $3.7 billion of spectrum clearing cost, primarily using operating cash flow. The remaining spectrum payments are minimal and will be made in 2024.  Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $122.2 billion, an improvement of $4.3 billion from the end of second quarter, and $7.1 billion lower year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash on hand, which we are using to pay the clearing cost I just described. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times as of the end of the third quarter, representing a 0.1, churn improvement year-over-year.  Overall, I'm pleased with our ability to deliver stronger operational and financial trends. We are focused on finishing the year strong with continued improvements in volumes and financials, setting us up for meaningful deleveraging opportunities in 2024.  I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. I'm proud of the progress our team has made and our operating results over the last three quarters should also give you confidence in us. We're delivering on our financial targets ahead of schedule on several key metrics and are restoring our leverage ratios to where we want them to be. We have a great network and our free cash flow generation is industry leading and we have more than 10 million broadband subscribers and that number is growing at near record rates.  As we enter the final quarter of 2023, our goals are clear; deliver strong growth in wireless service revenue; EBITDA and free cash flow. Our segmented and disciplined approach to consumer mobility is working and we expect our momentum to continue building in the fourth quarter. Enabling all of this is America's best and most reliable 5G networks. Or C-band spectrum has already benefited mobility and broadband.  Deploying the remaining C-band will make this network even stronger and more resilient and I'm excited about the opportunities that lies ahead.  Let me close with this. Our performance has put us firmly on track to meet our full year financial targets and position us well as we approach 2024. We're excited to head into 2024 with all of our assets in place and a great team to execute our strategy.  With that, I hand the call back to Brady for questions. \nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we are ready to take questions this morning. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]  And the first question for today will come from Phil Cusick of JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick: Hi guys. Thank you. Two if I can. Tony, how should we think about the pieces of free cash flow growing our stability next year? And after making the C-band relocation payments, what obligations other than the dividend will prevent you from delivering? And then Hans as a follow-up, there's a lot of speculation about M&A in the fiber and wireless spaces lately. Can you talk about any interest you have in buying fiber or wireless assets in the market? And if so, what might be criteria for that? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg : I will start and I hand it over to Tony. I mean, first on the cash flow, I think you have seen us now the last couple of years are focusing very much on our service revenue expansion, EBITDA and cash flow expansion and all our incentives for the management deceptive from the Board, both short and long term. So this is a key thing for us to see that we are continuing to generate a lot of cash flow. Tony will take \u2013 talk to the puts and takes.  Regarding fiber adds, and first of all I love our strategy. I mean our strategy was clear from 2017. In the Fios footprint of course we build a lot of fiber doing extremely well. You saw this quarter again a record quarter of Fios subscribers. Outside we build one fiber over a couple of years. We're basically in all the major markets. We have one fiber to our own network.  Right now, our strategy is clear that we want to take the broadband subscribers with fixed lines access because we get them right now. It's a superior product and we don't see a need right now for adding any fiber to that footprint. Over time, of course, we will always look into it and anyone that would dispose any telecommunication assets, any market will talk to us, but the total is high. I mean, we have a great network and we have built a really good strategy around our technology. \nTony Skiadas : Hi Phil. Good morning. So on the cash generation, so we're very pleased thus far. I'll start with where we are in the third quarter. So we're pleased with the cash generation of the business. The performance of the business, and as you saw the continued discipline that we had with promos and retention gave us the confidence to raise the free cash flow guide by $1 billion to more than $18 billion. And that's with CapEx at the upper end of the range and also with higher interest expense.  So we feel very good about the balance of the year and are positioning heading into next year. Obviously, we're not going to guide on 2024 at this time, but I can share some qualitative aspects as we look ahead to free cash flow for 2024. On the plus side, we continue to focus the team on an improving EBITDA profile and that's a big focus of the team.  With respect to CapEx, we said a couple of times here in the past that we expect to run at $17 billion to $17.5 billion for 2024, which is back to a business as usual level of spend that you've seen from us. And then we also strive to make continued improvements in working capital. And then offsetting that, we expect higher interest costs from both in the rate environment and the reduction in capitalized interest due to the early clearing of the C-band spectrum.  And then with taxes, as you know, under current legislation, taxes are going to be pressured by the continued phase out of bonus depreciation and we'll see how that plays out. And, so heading into 2024, we continue to focus on strong free cash flow generation and opportunities for meaningful debt reduction. And we don't see any obstacles of Delevering.  Thanks. Okay guys. \nBrady Connor: Yeah, great. Thanks. Thanks Phil, Brad. We're ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open sir. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Hans, you talked a lot about fixed wireless. You've got the rest of the C-band. Can you help update the fixed wireless footprint? The open for sale and where you are today? And how you get to the $50 million households or any updated target that you have there?  And then, Tony, you talked a little bit about some of the pricing actions you've taken so far. Can you just cheese out for us what you've recognized in Q3? And what I think you've talked about a tailwind when going into Q4. So, how we think about some of the, the kind of sequential benefits that are still to come? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg : Simon, I can start with fixed wireless access. As you can see, we continue on that rhythm with the 354, 000 every quarter. The additional C-band we got, used a couple of weeks ago we initially go straight to augmenting our urban areas. We\u2019ve already had the sites and then in the early part of next year, we will also start deploying that in suburban and rural areas.  And of course, that's an even greater opportunity for us because there are more underserved markets and our fixed wireless actually come extremely quickly into those markets. So that's will just fortify our situation and how we want to roll this out. We have a target of $4 million to $5 million subscribers by 2025. We keep that of course, we have dimension on network for way more and the team, of course, have a have the internal targets that were set by me. But right now, there's nothing else that we want to deliver this target as well to the market. We always want to deliver what we tell the market and we're going to do that. And then we have a conversation about that when we've passed it. \nTony Skiadas : And Simon, on the - on your question on pricing. So a few things here. We executed a number of pricing actions as you saw. The legacy mix and match that we did earlier in September will yield about a $100 million of incremental benefit in the in the fourth quarter and we also see improving volumes on mobility and year-over-year improvements there. And we also see a an increasing contribution for fixed wireless access. You saw the growth we had in the quarter with 384,000 net adds. We have 2.7, almost 2.7 million subs in our base. So we feel very good about the momentum there. So, very good progress on service revenue and setting us up well for next year. \nSimon Flannery: Right. Thanks a lot. \nBrady Connor: Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open sir. \nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Just two questions. First on the upgrades. Obviously, that number continued to come down or solidly into this sort of 3% range. I mean, Hans, in you're prepared remarks you sort of suggested that you expect to see the same for the next few quarters. I guess, two questions there.  First of all, what in your view, what is really driving it? And do you think that this is a temporary issue or and that, it'll go back to some sort of normalized rate? And then, any comments on what that low rate is really doing to your business?  And then, secondly, in the past, you guys have given some numbers, and some metrics on what the C-band is doing for your business as it gets rolled out. Any update there? Are you still seeing improvement in things like gross adds, ARPU, Churn as you roll C-band out? Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Thanks, John. on the upgrade, as we're seeing now for a couple of quarters, when we started our segmented approach on the consumer side, where we actually tried to meet our customers in different segments with the right offerings. That of course, have driven a lower upgrade rate. But as we are not doing a peanut butter spread sort of that everybody gets everything.  So we're really trying to see that we have the right offer for our customer and what is giving me confidence is that our gross adds just continued to grow for us. So we have the right offering in the market together with myPlan. Of course, fourth quarter is always a little bit higher on upgrades because that's normally a seasonality.  But in general, I see that our model is working and this is both helping our customers with the right offerings. But not only that is helping us with the bottom-line and the cash flow generation that we're very focused here at Verizon. And then on the C-band, we see the same things as we have discussed before. We see lower churn where we deploy C-band.  We see better step ups in those regions. And then on top of it, we increased fixed wireless access. So there's no difference on that. So I think we \u2013 same, same and that's why we're so excited by C-band continue to roll out and I have gotten hold of old C-band here, just a couple of weeks ago. \nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Hans. \nBrady Connor : Brad we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir. \nBrett Feldman: Thanks, for taking the question. Coming back to service revenue growth is we're looking ahead into next year and maybe digging a little bit into ARPU drivers, I know you don't report postpaid, phone ARPU, but it's clearly an important component of what drives your ARPA. And I was hoping you could give us some insight into how you're thinking about those drivers next year?  So for example, are you still - you still see opportunity to make further pricing adjustments in the base? Could you maybe give us some insight into what the mix is looking like? And are you continuing to see the highest tiered plans being among the most popular? And then, are there any headwinds that might be emerging in the ARPU dynamic we need to be taking account for? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg : So, let me start on the high level. I mean, first of all, we need to think about our total offering on wireless and we haven't spoken so far much about the business side, but the business side again for the ninth quarter in a row had more than 125,000 phone net adds, actually 150 plus. So they are doing good in a market where our customers on that side, is really looking on the performance of the network and the high quality distribution we have. So I'm very pleased with that and I have - I would like to say it.  On the consumer side, I think we have found a model with myPlan and how we go to market. All the changes that consumer group and Samper have done since earlier, this year with the plans to decentralization, sales incentives, is helping us to be in the right proposition. Then we always look to order new value add that we can give to our customers to broaden the scope for us and for our customers like we did with the third tier on the network side on myPlan or that we took away the discount on the convergence within mobility and fixed wireless access in these quarters.  We will continue to look at it, but it's nothing that is the most important right now because I think we having offering that is really compelling to our customers. \nTony Skiadas : And then, Brett, on the - on your service revenue question, just some qualitative thoughts for you. On the plus side, I would say, look the pricing actions we took this year, obviously have a tailwind in the fourth quarter and carry over into next year. So we continue to see momentum there. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we do expect an improving volume profile in the consumer business. So that's something that the team is very focused on.  Fixed wireless access continues to scale. So, as I mentioned earlier, another 384,000 net adds, even as Hans said, and taking away the discount as well. So the momentum is strong there. And continued increase premium mix with myPlan. So myPlan is seeing roughly 70% premium mix and we're very pleased with the progress there.  And we're also seeing some of the headwinds from the promo amortization starting to ease a little bit, that's starting to flatten out, which is good news. And also a function of all the discipline that we've had this year. And then offsetting that, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, prepaid continues to be a headwind the in the near term as we continue to work to improve the business and that's still ongoing.  So those are the puts and takes in terms of service revenue. \nBrett Feldman: Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open. \nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. I'm curious if you can unpack the ways in which Verizon will look to achieve its cost-cutting targets through 2025, as well, as how much of those benefits could come through in 2024 versus 2025? And then just separately on prepaid, just an update would be great on the integration of TracFone? And how Verizon is thinking about the opportunities and timing of potentially taking some of those prepaid customers and migrating them over to your postpaid base. Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Mike. On the cost target, we are definitely on track for delivering on the $2 million to $3 million that we talked about when we launched a new structure. The new structure started this year. The first of January. We see a lot of tractions on it and probably, as you follow us closely, you have seen that we've worked on the managed services side together with HL.  We have done a big transaction on the customer care side. We are doing a lot of transaction on the IT side. We're bringing more AI into the network and to the customer care. It's a lot of things ongoing. So I have a high confidence that we are finding along the road there all the savings we need and the traction is very high in the company on the efficiency given that we have one organization right now, Russian Global Services supporting all others to see that we find the best measurements across the company.  And I can go back to prepaid and maybe Tony has some more comments on the cost side. \nTony Skiadas : Sure. Thanks. And Mike, just a couple of other additional points that Hans mentioned. So, we're on track to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion as Hans said. $200 million to $300 million of that will come this year in 2023 in EBITDA and that was already contemplated in the guide. Hans mentioned a lot of the initiatives. The other item I would mention is we are being very disciplined in business wireline by deemphasizing low margin deals. So that's something that the team is very, very focused on, as well.  We're not going to give cost targets for \u201824 at this time, but we feel good that we have a good foundation that are driving EBITDA improvements and you saw it in the quarter with both sequential and year-over-year improvements in EBITDA that's going to set the foundation for improving EBITDA profile in 2024. \nHans Vestberg : On the value segment, in prepaid and TracFone, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are at the low point to first half of \u201823 and from here on, we should start sequentially improving. Secondly, this is really important for our strategy. We want to build the network once and have as many connections as possible and address the entire market on wireless.  And, of course, being strong and being the number one in the value segment is important. Then from a market point of view, we all know that there has been some sort of blend between the low end on postpaid and prepaid, which means that the volumes in preparation is little bit lower and we have not been part of that transformation or taking customer for prepaid.  So what we're doing right now in our own operation, which is a lot, but one, we're building up Total by Verizon, which is a great speed we have on opening new doors. That's going to help us to move up to postpaid for the customers that want to do that. But also have an high end value proposition.  Secondly, we work with the national retailers that we have to see that we are fortifying our offerings in our store. And finally, you're seeing that feasible continuous with the pace it has. And that we're working with a lot of other things. So it's a lot of ongoing here that gives us confidence that we will sequentially continue to improve. And but clearly, this is very important for our overall strategy. \nMichael Rollins: Thanks. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir. \nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I have a question on fixed wireless. There continues to be a lot of debate regarding the sustainability of fixed wireless served by macro as all sites given the trajectory of broadband usage and of course, unit economics of radio access networks versus fiber. So really I guess two questions. One, since you started the fixed wireless deployment, have your assumptions changed at all regarding usage or the number of fixed wireless customers you can ultimately load network with over time?  And secondly, what developments have occurred in millimeter waves delivered fixed wireless this year? And how at this point are you thinking about millimeter wave evolving over the next couple years as a scalable access technology? Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Hi, Bryan. And the first, yeah, our assumption has changed on fixed wireless access because our technology has improved more than we thought from the beginning. That means that we can take on even more capacity. And we're only on the first inning on the software improvements, and our optimization of the network. I think Joe and his team is doing a fantastic job with it.  Customers are using it on the consumer side, equally much as on the Fios. So that there's no different on usage. So I think we have a great path forward with technology and we are not seeing everything we can do still with the fixed wireless access when it comes to software development, radio improvements, et cetera. So I'm - I have no hesitation over the assumption with that made. They are actually having better assumptions today.  When it comes to millimeter wave, that is playing a vital role for us for many reasons. First of all, it takes in all high density areas. They take the majority of the capacity. And that's very important for several reasons. I unleashed a mid-band spectrum in order to have better performance on the street, but also in fixed wireless access.  So millimeter wave will continue to play a very vital role. As we have said several times, we built very few - very quickly in all major places. And now we're sort of augmenting where we see a lot of traffic. On top of that, of course, we see opportunities for using our millimeter wave also for MDUs over the time to see that we address that market with fixed wireless access.  So, all in all, we still have a lot of technology evolution to see that we can serve even more customers with even better performance and more capacity. So, I'm very happy and as you've seen on fixed wireless access, our MPS scores is all out to the shot. I mean the customers loves it. It is easy. It's quick to deploy itself to install. So I think we hit it clearly with this product and we want to push it with our team and see the customer gets the right products. \nBryan Kraft: Thank you Hans. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open. \nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you very much. Quick question. I apologize if this was addressed. Can you quantify how much of the interest expense going from capitalization to the income statement from C-band? And then secondly, where are you as far as being able to utilize the fixed wireless to help reduce cost or type two circuits and that's sort of thing? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg : I can start with the fixed wireless access and Tony will. Yeah, great question. Sometimes we are focused on fixed wireless access being sort of a consumer solution for broadband. Today, we sell a lot of fixed wireless access for - in the business segment as well both for large enterprises and for small and medium customers which has a different usage pattern, which is great.  And also we see and Kyle has discussed that several times. He see also, this is a way of optimizing our access cost by having fixed access as a barrier or transport in many cases. So, clearly again, this is how we build our network from the beginning to be able from the datacenter to the edge of the network have a total harmonized network that can fastly move all the data and then at the edge of the network, we'll have different type of access technologies in order to serve our customers and fixed wireless access can serve many different use cases.  And we, we tend to talk a lot about the consumer fixed wireless access use case. But I have or Kyle have a lot of use cases in the business segment and if you look at the numbers this quarter, he's continuing to add the lot of fixed wireless access customers, as well. \nTony Skiadas : And then, Frank on the on the capitalized interest question, in the quarter, we saw about $0.03 of pressure from capitalized interest from the time we got the licenses. And then, for the fourth quarter, we estimate $0.03 to $0.04 of pressure from capitalized interest. So hope that helps. \nFrank Louthan: All right. Great. Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open. \nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. Just the first one, Hans, at the very beginning of the call, you said that you were being really successful at three things, mobility, broadband, and private networks. And we haven't really heard a lot about what you're doing in private networks. What your goals are, what you're successes has been.  So if you could elaborate a little bit on what that is and why it's one of the big three things that we should care about Verizon being good at it will be super helpful. And then the second is maybe this is for Tony. Just, I think we just touched on a little bit, but the, the success that you guys have been having in the postpaid phone subscriber net adds in business, could you elaborate a little bit on where that's coming from? Like, given that the consumer isn't growing, how is it that the business continues to be so successful quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter and should we assume that that just can continue? Thank you so much. \nHans Vestberg : Thank you, David. On the private networks, yeah, good question. What is happening in the private network right now is that we are doing proof-of-concept to go to commercials. We have ramped up a fantastic funnel. We're starting getting more and more deals every quarter. They start pretty small. They start sort of like a Wi-Fi substitution.  And then, when it works, let's say, you have one big this logistic company. They take the one logistics center then they do it and all. We are in that phase of ramping that up to do in one to many at the moment. What we have done, we've done two things very important. We're cut the lead times of proof-of-concept to actually to commercial deal.  And it's very clear for our customers that the capacity, the security and the low latency is a game changer for them when they see it. And secondly we also now have an ecosystem of products, infrastructure, modem, chipsets, phones and radios that can serve different use cases. So, that's why we're excited over it. We are not going to see any significant revenues that has an impact on Verizon overall in \u201824. We are going to see that in \u201825, but why it's important is that, this is an area we never been into.  This is a total the new time we can address by running private networks for different industries for different large enterprises across the country with our distribution and technology. I see this is a great opportunity to how we use our spectrum. So that's why we pay a lot of attention to it. And with a lot of opportunities coming through it.  And before Tony talks about the business segment, and the wireless, I would say one main reason why we continue to do is our wireless \u2013 our network is the best. I mean, if you ask any of our enterprise customers or SMB customers, the reliability and the performance of our network is just the best. And that's a very important buying criteria in that segment. Tony? \nTony Skiadas : Sure. So, Dave, a couple things. We're pleased again with the strong results from Kyle and the team. We saw a great phone net adds in the quarter, 151,000 and over 430,000 year-to-date. And we saw healthy demand across the board. That would be enterprise public sector and small medium biz. And that performance is in a very uncertain environment and as Hans said, these strong results validate that the businesses continue to trust the Verizon network even during uncertain economic times.  And, we do see certain pressures in certain sectors and we're certainly not immune to it. But we're not seeing anything significant and from a competitive standpoint, I would tell you that we're being very disciplined and we're not going to chase the bad deals that are that are better unprofitable.  The other thing I would mention is FWA volumes also continue at a strong pace and in business. And we had a hundred and 132,000 net adds in the third quarter and over 400,000 year-to-date. So we have great momentum heading into the fourth quarter here and as we set up for next year. \nDavid Barden: And if I could just one more and I apologize. Thank you, Tony. So Hans, it's been six months since the team kind of got reset and you put all the people to work. The results seem to be moving in the right direction. Are you - how happy are you with the choices you made right now? \nHans Vestberg : I'm very happy with the choices. I think, as always, when you make a change and we did quite a big change. And I think six out of the eight seats in the leadership team changed in one swoop. I think we had good alignment from the first week. What we need to do, all the way from Kyle, Tony and Sam, Pat which was very important and Joe which is sort of the four operational units. And you can see the results right now. I mean the guys are executing extremely well.  So I'm happy with it. I want to push them even harder but these guys are really good. They take hard pressure and they deliver on it. So, I'm happy on the choices and the team is doing well. \nDavid Barden: Great. Thanks guys. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. \nCraig Moffett : Hi, thank you. Maybe starting with Tony, Tony can you talk about what contribution you're getting from your wholesale wireless revenue that the cable industry scales? And then, could you talk about what benefits that's having in terms of margin accretion and what have you? And then, I wonder if you just - how we should think about potential risk to that revenue stream as ComCast and Charter start to roll out strand on the small cells to potentially offload more of that traffic onto their own networks. \nTony Skiadas : Okay. So a few things here. So as, you know, we can't discuss the particular economics of any commercial deal and that includes the commercial deals we have with the cable companies. What I can tell you is that, we are very happy with the MB&O agreements and those agreements are accretive. It's important business for us and as Hans said many times it\u2019s consistent with our strategy to monetize the network. It's very profitable business for us.  It's growing and we're very comfortable with the arrangement. But that's as far as we'll go. \nBrady Connor : All right. Thanks Craig. Brad we're ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open sir. \nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So maybe Hans, you in terms of fixed wireless business, when you think about the capacity that you have with C-band and you've talked a couple of times about momentum heading into next year, as you expand into other footprints, is there any kind of a goal post that you have in terms of the kind of growth here - growth aspirations that you have to balance it with a capacity use that the network may have. So the 350, 400, kind of a number, does it go to 500 or is there some kind of a framework you guys are thinking about in terms of your aspiration there? Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Thanks, Kannan. I think on the fixed wireless access we have said a couple of times that we like they read them on 400,000 per quarter, because it's putting our sort of our operations in the right model or deploying this. And as we have also decentralized or regionalized our go to market, we can work with the markets where we actually open for sale fixed-wireless access, work with the local community, work with the local government and also address it through our stores.  We can focus our efforts in that region and see that we capture all the demand and the funnel we have there. So, we think it's a good model that we have right now and that's also there's some loss of physics how quickly we can roll out the C-band. But I can tell you there's no one holding back any investments here in order to get the C-band to our customers as soon as possible.  So, I think, we will continue to look at that and that. I mean, that type of levels going forward, as well. And that will help us with reaching any goalpost we have or whatever goalpost we have communicated to the market. \nKannan Venkateshwar: Great. Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Brad we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Williams of TD Cowen. Your line is open. \nGreg Williams : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, Hans you mentioned the improving KPIs when you launch C-band in the markets similar to last quarter, as well. Just thinking, should we see churn improvements from here as the C-band sort of maturates this markets or every sort of optimal levels? And then second on just on media reports suggesting that you are hiring suggesting seriously in the wire line side and I'm just thinking about your fiber-to-the-home builds maybe it's not on the M&A side. You said it's high hurdle that's on your organic side if you would bring up your builds or even the beta opportunity there. Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Okay. On the, KPIs, you are correct and we rollout the C-bandwidth we have better retention and better step-ups. And of course, we also expect that we can take share. I think in the consumer side and the business in both sides, we see opportunities as we come with the fixed files access to this market and with the C-band. So there is share gains. We are planning to do here and our teams are very focused on it going forward.  The second question was around fiber. In our ILEC, I guess and we're not holding back on that. I mean, first of all, you saw how great we're doing this quarter with Fios. We'll continue to invest in Fios and see we have our customers. Outside the Fios, our primary strategy is to build on a One Fiber and the fix wireless access to capture the market before anybody else is even the remotely there. That's what we do.  Then over time, as I said hundred times, I got to have optionality if I would have another access technology over time. But that's not in the chords right now. We have all the capacity and the technology out in the fields right now and the quicker we can come out, the quicker we can meet the demand that\u2019s out there and meeting the customer that wants our broadband, which is a lot of them. \nGreg Williams : Got it. Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Hey Brad, we have time for one more question, please. \nOperator: Your last question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. \nTim Horan: Thanks, guys. Hans, stepping back a second, can you talk about the ability for yourselves and industry demand of how all the investments in the last few years both accelerating growth in free cash flow, how important is pricing here because inflations were only 4%, GDP is growing about 5%, inflation is probably above 4% again next year or we are not really seeing much revenue growth. So, what you think needs to be done for the industry to kind of monetize all the investments? Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : I can talk for ourselves. I think we are in a moment where we actually are monetizing by being very segmented both in our business side and in our consumer side. And that both having the right offers for our customers at the same time we are again raising bottom-line for ourselves. So, I think that\u2019s where we are and we have done some price adjustments but that has also included new values for our customers. I think we now are coming to a moment where we are probably going to have a little bit more on quantities not only price given the track that we have in our business right now.  So we're going to balance that out doing the right for our customers, but also doing right for our shareholders. And then, we are of course adding that with our broadband growth which is also helping us. And then, as Tony said, we are taking out cost at the same time. So that's how we work. And that's why we can lift the free cash flow for this year. The guidance even though we're on the high end on our CapEx guidance, as well as higher or headwinds from the interest rate.  So that tells you a little bit how we feel about the business. How we now have the right propositions in a market and we can sort of retooling that if something happen. But right now, we feel confident about the model we have. \nTim Horan: And related to that, I know you want to get that EBITDA back to pre-auction levels. Do you have a kind of a time frame on that and just remind us what - how do you do that? \nHans Vestberg : Yeah. So what we have said before was that we want to come to a ratio of 2.25 over the net debt to EBITDA and we are going to continue to work our way down and that is a primary goal for us. Number one in the capital allocation is to invest in our business. Number two is continue to put our board in a position so they can increase our dividend. We are on 17 years of consecutive increases and thirdly we're paying down our debts. When we come to that ratio, we will start having a conversation about buybacks.  But we want to do buybacks not that one-off or something. It has to be a consecutive program all the time. So, but we're not there yet. But the team is doing great job. Tony talked about the 2.6 billion they we reduced debt this quarter with the tenders were down. So we will continue to do that with the cash flow. That's where we are yielding right now. \nTim Horan: Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Yeah, thanks, Tim. Brad, before we end the call, I want to turn it back over to Hans for a few closing statements here. \nHans Vestberg : Before we close, I want to take a moment to address the humanitarian crisis in Israel and Palestine. That has continued to escalate over the past few weeks. At Verizon we stand against terrorism in all its forms and condemn the violence that has claimed the lives of so many innocent civilians. The Verizon Foundation has committed a $2 million donation to organizations supporting relief efforts. And we continue to waive international long distance charges for calls and text from US to the region.  My hope is that we will move to a peaceful resolution as soon as possible. In the meantime, we need to come together as a society and lean into what connects us, not what divides us. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and good morning, to everyone. I am pleased to share our strong third quarter results making out the quarter with solid growth and improving profitability. It is clear that our strategy is working. In both the consumer and the business groups we are executing a segmented agile strategy that provides value to our customers and our bottom-line.  We have delivered growth in each of areas where on, wireless service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. This is evidence that we have the right strategy and are achieving our results in a financially disciplined way.  Now let me share our financials for the quarter. For the third quarter, wireless service revenue is up 3.9% year-over-year, driven by expanding and deepening our customer relationships. This revenue growth is a key driver for adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion for the quarter which is higher than both Q3 last year and sequentially.  Our year to-date free cash flow of $14.6 billion is already exceeding our full year free cash flow for 2022. Thanks to our focus on high quality revenue growth, disciplined promotion strategy, cost efficiency and CapEx reduction of the recent years of heightened capital-intensity driven by the C-band, and fiber investments.  I'm proud to share that my team and I have taken actions to further our position our financial strengths. Our strong cash generation enabled us to reduce net debt, strengthen our balance sheet, and deliver a higher dividend to our shareholders. We're working to bring our leverage ratio to the pre-Spectrum acquisition levels.  During the third quarter, we paid down $2.6 billion in debt and increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. A current industry record that we take pride in. Our dividend coverage is very healthy. Year to-date our free cash flow dividend payout ratio is approximately 56%, a significant improvement from a year ago.  In summary, in spite of an uncertain economic environment, we are on pace to finish 2023 strong. We are confident that we will deliver on the financial guidance that we issued to you at the start of the year and this morning are announcing higher free cash flow guidance for 2023. Tony will provide you more details in the few moments.  Now, let me share more on how our business units are driving our strategy forward. In the quarter, we delivered on our key growth areas, mobility, broadband and private networks. Thanks to our networks, scale and technology advantages.  In consumer mobility, we achieved sequential and year year-over-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds by continuing to put the customer at the center everything we do rather than engaging in aggressive promotional activity like others in the industry, we're offering our consumers optionality and flexibility to choose how they want to use our products and services.  Our differentiated approach or segmentation, financial discipline is paying off with growth in postpaid phone growth adds and lower promotional cash costs. There is more work to be done, but our responsible approach position us to grow subscribers profitably. Since its launch in May, myPlan continues to deliver a personalized experience, giving our customers the value, choice and control that they want.  During the third quarter,we enhanced myPlan by adding Ultimate Unlimited, a third tier with more value and services, further increasing our premium mix and ARPA growth. This is just one example of the flexibility and speed to market that myPlan provides. And I'm excited about what is to come. Our targeted and segmented market approach also serves as well during the iPhone 15 launch and we continue to execute with an iTunes meeting our customers' needs while maintaining a disciplined approach.  Our competitive position is now stronger. And we've delivered positive consumer postpaid phone net adds in the month of September. We anticipate that momentum will continue as we are on track to exceed our postpaid phone net adds from Q4 of last year.  Postpaid phone shown levels are stable even with our targeted pricing actions throughout the year. We continue to see muted upgrade levels, which is something we are watching carefully and is a trend we expect will continue for the next few quarters.  Turning to business mobility. Verizon Business Group delivered 151,000, phone net ads and reached our ninth consecutive quarter above 125,000. Business in governments continue place an increased emphasis on best-in-class reliable connectivity that only Verizon provides. Across mobility, postpaid phone net adds were 100,000, compared to 8,000 last year. We have the largest customer base in the industry and are still finding new ways to add customers through innovation, service quality and a variety of offerings and partnerships that competitors cannot match.  As we discussed before, we're seeking the optimal balance between price and quantity that allow us to grow our base profitability. In our value business we have had negative volumes, but I'm encouraged by our quarter-over-quarter improvements. As I've said before, the value business is a key part of our growth strategy, and we will continue to invest in it and adjust to the needs of the markets.  As we mentioned last quarter, we believe we're seeing the bottom for prepaid volumes and the team is committed and working daily to grow our value business.  Moving to broadband, we delivered another strong quarter with more than 400,000 new subscribers for the fourth quarter in a row. We finished Q3 with $10.3 million broadband subscribers, up by more than 1.7 million subscribers from a year ago, a 21% increase. Critical to the strengths of this key area is fixed wireless access, something you know we deeply believe in.  Our fixed wireless access net adds of 384,000 continue to be strong even with a recent $10 increase for new bundled customers, further evidence of the demand for our product. Where FWA is available, our customers take it and loving it as seen by the high net promoter score. I'm excited towards the share that on the Fios side we had 72,000 Internet net adds for the quarter, up, almost 20% year-over-year and one or best performances in seven years.  Fios remains a coveted, high quality service and we continue to take share and deliver strong numbers even in a lower mover environment. When it comes to private networks, we demand for the product continue to grow, especially those solutions built with licensed spectrum, which provides a more secure and differentiated experience for the end-users.  Businesses are increasingly looking to us for the private network solutions helping to grow our sales funnel and scale the number of installations each quarter.  Let me end by talking about the backbone of our business, our network. During the third quarter, we obtained early access to our remaining C-band spectrum. In urban markets, where C-band is already deployed, we're firing on all cylinders and leveraging its full potential through software upgrades, delivering two to three times more spectrum depth.  As a result, peak speeds go from 9 megabits per second to an amazing 2.4 gigabits per second enabling an even better experience for our customers. You've heard me say this before, but let me say it again. C-Band is a game change for our business, giving us better customer attention and step up, as well as a strong broadband opportunity with fixed wireless access.  Every day we see the benefits of our generation investment in C-band spectrum and the impact it will have for our customers for years to come. And our network is winning. This quarter, we received J.D. Power awards in all six US regions, receiving the most awards for wireless network quality for the 31st time in a row.  We have the best networks in the market and we will extend our lead as we complete our C-band deployment, first augmenting urban areas, and next year in suburban and rural markets. This is our key differentiator and the center of everything we do. And we're doing all of this in a responsible way. We're optimizing our network while returning to business as usual levels of CapEx.  We're finding cost efficiencies across our business both as a result of our a new structure, and by emphasizing profitability, when evaluating new opportunities like within business wireline. Our cost efficiency program remains on track to meet our savings goal of $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2025.  Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial and operational performance in more detail. Thank you, Tony. I'm proud of the progress our team has made and our operating results over the last three quarters should also give you confidence in us. We're delivering on our financial targets ahead of schedule on several key metrics and are restoring our leverage ratios to where we want them to be. We have a great network and our free cash flow generation is industry leading and we have more than 10 million broadband subscribers and that number is growing at near record rates.  As we enter the final quarter of 2023, our goals are clear; deliver strong growth in wireless service revenue; EBITDA and free cash flow. Our segmented and disciplined approach to consumer mobility is working and we expect our momentum to continue building in the fourth quarter. Enabling all of this is America's best and most reliable 5G networks. Or C-band spectrum has already benefited mobility and broadband.  Deploying the remaining C-band will make this network even stronger and more resilient and I'm excited about the opportunities that lies ahead.  Let me close with this. Our performance has put us firmly on track to meet our full year financial targets and position us well as we approach 2024. We're excited to head into 2024 with all of our assets in place and a great team to execute our strategy.  With that, I hand the call back to Brady for questions. I will start and I hand it over to Tony. I mean, first on the cash flow, I think you have seen us now the last couple of years are focusing very much on our service revenue expansion, EBITDA and cash flow expansion and all our incentives for the management deceptive from the Board, both short and long term. So this is a key thing for us to see that we are continuing to generate a lot of cash flow. Tony will take \u2013 talk to the puts and takes.  Regarding fiber adds, and first of all I love our strategy. I mean our strategy was clear from 2017. In the Fios footprint of course we build a lot of fiber doing extremely well. You saw this quarter again a record quarter of Fios subscribers. Outside we build one fiber over a couple of years. We're basically in all the major markets. We have one fiber to our own network.  Right now, our strategy is clear that we want to take the broadband subscribers with fixed lines access because we get them right now. It's a superior product and we don't see a need right now for adding any fiber to that footprint. Over time, of course, we will always look into it and anyone that would dispose any telecommunication assets, any market will talk to us, but the total is high. I mean, we have a great network and we have built a really good strategy around our technology. Simon, I can start with fixed wireless access. As you can see, we continue on that rhythm with the 354, 000 every quarter. The additional C-band we got, used a couple of weeks ago we initially go straight to augmenting our urban areas. We've already had the sites and then in the early part of next year, we will also start deploying that in suburban and rural areas.  And of course, that's an even greater opportunity for us because there are more underserved markets and our fixed wireless actually come extremely quickly into those markets. So that's will just fortify our situation and how we want to roll this out. We have a target of $4 million to $5 million subscribers by 2025. We keep that of course, we have dimension on network for way more and the team, of course, have a have the internal targets that were set by me. But right now, there's nothing else that we want to deliver this target as well to the market. We always want to deliver what we tell the market and we're going to do that. And then we have a conversation about that when we've passed it. Thanks, John. on the upgrade, as we're seeing now for a couple of quarters, when we started our segmented approach on the consumer side, where we actually tried to meet our customers in different segments with the right offerings. That of course, have driven a lower upgrade rate. But as we are not doing a peanut butter spread sort of that everybody gets everything.  So we're really trying to see that we have the right offer for our customer and what is giving me confidence is that our gross adds just continued to grow for us. So we have the right offering in the market together with myPlan. Of course, fourth quarter is always a little bit higher on upgrades because that's normally a seasonality.  But in general, I see that our model is working and this is both helping our customers with the right offerings. But not only that is helping us with the bottom-line and the cash flow generation that we're very focused here at Verizon. And then on the C-band, we see the same things as we have discussed before. We see lower churn where we deploy C-band.  We see better step ups in those regions. And then on top of it, we increased fixed wireless access. So there's no difference on that. So I think we \u2013 same, same and that's why we're so excited by C-band continue to roll out and I have gotten hold of old C-band here, just a couple of weeks ago. So, let me start on the high level. I mean, first of all, we need to think about our total offering on wireless and we haven't spoken so far much about the business side, but the business side again for the ninth quarter in a row had more than 125,000 phone net adds, actually 150 plus. So they are doing good in a market where our customers on that side, is really looking on the performance of the network and the high quality distribution we have. So I'm very pleased with that and I have - I would like to say it.  On the consumer side, I think we have found a model with myPlan and how we go to market. All the changes that consumer group and Samper have done since earlier, this year with the plans to decentralization, sales incentives, is helping us to be in the right proposition. Then we always look to order new value add that we can give to our customers to broaden the scope for us and for our customers like we did with the third tier on the network side on myPlan or that we took away the discount on the convergence within mobility and fixed wireless access in these quarters.  We will continue to look at it, but it's nothing that is the most important right now because I think we having offering that is really compelling to our customers. Thank you, Mike. On the cost target, we are definitely on track for delivering on the $2 million to $3 million that we talked about when we launched a new structure. The new structure started this year. The first of January. We see a lot of tractions on it and probably, as you follow us closely, you have seen that we've worked on the managed services side together with HL.  We have done a big transaction on the customer care side. We are doing a lot of transaction on the IT side. We're bringing more AI into the network and to the customer care. It's a lot of things ongoing. So I have a high confidence that we are finding along the road there all the savings we need and the traction is very high in the company on the efficiency given that we have one organization right now, Russian Global Services supporting all others to see that we find the best measurements across the company.  And I can go back to prepaid and maybe Tony has some more comments on the cost side. On the value segment, in prepaid and TracFone, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are at the low point to first half of \u201823 and from here on, we should start sequentially improving. Secondly, this is really important for our strategy. We want to build the network once and have as many connections as possible and address the entire market on wireless.  And, of course, being strong and being the number one in the value segment is important. Then from a market point of view, we all know that there has been some sort of blend between the low end on postpaid and prepaid, which means that the volumes in preparation is little bit lower and we have not been part of that transformation or taking customer for prepaid.  So what we're doing right now in our own operation, which is a lot, but one, we're building up Total by Verizon, which is a great speed we have on opening new doors. That's going to help us to move up to postpaid for the customers that want to do that. But also have an high end value proposition.  Secondly, we work with the national retailers that we have to see that we are fortifying our offerings in our store. And finally, you're seeing that feasible continuous with the pace it has. And that we're working with a lot of other things. So it's a lot of ongoing here that gives us confidence that we will sequentially continue to improve. And but clearly, this is very important for our overall strategy. Hi, Bryan. And the first, yeah, our assumption has changed on fixed wireless access because our technology has improved more than we thought from the beginning. That means that we can take on even more capacity. And we're only on the first inning on the software improvements, and our optimization of the network. I think Joe and his team is doing a fantastic job with it.  Customers are using it on the consumer side, equally much as on the Fios. So that there's no different on usage. So I think we have a great path forward with technology and we are not seeing everything we can do still with the fixed wireless access when it comes to software development, radio improvements, et cetera. So I'm - I have no hesitation over the assumption with that made. They are actually having better assumptions today.  When it comes to millimeter wave, that is playing a vital role for us for many reasons. First of all, it takes in all high density areas. They take the majority of the capacity. And that's very important for several reasons. I unleashed a mid-band spectrum in order to have better performance on the street, but also in fixed wireless access.  So millimeter wave will continue to play a very vital role. As we have said several times, we built very few - very quickly in all major places. And now we're sort of augmenting where we see a lot of traffic. On top of that, of course, we see opportunities for using our millimeter wave also for MDUs over the time to see that we address that market with fixed wireless access.  So, all in all, we still have a lot of technology evolution to see that we can serve even more customers with even better performance and more capacity. So, I'm very happy and as you've seen on fixed wireless access, our MPS scores is all out to the shot. I mean the customers loves it. It is easy. It's quick to deploy itself to install. So I think we hit it clearly with this product and we want to push it with our team and see the customer gets the right products. I can start with the fixed wireless access and Tony will. Yeah, great question. Sometimes we are focused on fixed wireless access being sort of a consumer solution for broadband. Today, we sell a lot of fixed wireless access for - in the business segment as well both for large enterprises and for small and medium customers which has a different usage pattern, which is great.  And also we see and Kyle has discussed that several times. He see also, this is a way of optimizing our access cost by having fixed access as a barrier or transport in many cases. So, clearly again, this is how we build our network from the beginning to be able from the datacenter to the edge of the network have a total harmonized network that can fastly move all the data and then at the edge of the network, we'll have different type of access technologies in order to serve our customers and fixed wireless access can serve many different use cases.  And we, we tend to talk a lot about the consumer fixed wireless access use case. But I have or Kyle have a lot of use cases in the business segment and if you look at the numbers this quarter, he's continuing to add the lot of fixed wireless access customers, as well. Thank you, David. On the private networks, yeah, good question. What is happening in the private network right now is that we are doing proof-of-concept to go to commercials. We have ramped up a fantastic funnel. We're starting getting more and more deals every quarter. They start pretty small. They start sort of like a Wi-Fi substitution.  And then, when it works, let's say, you have one big this logistic company. They take the one logistics center then they do it and all. We are in that phase of ramping that up to do in one to many at the moment. What we have done, we've done two things very important. We're cut the lead times of proof-of-concept to actually to commercial deal.  And it's very clear for our customers that the capacity, the security and the low latency is a game changer for them when they see it. And secondly we also now have an ecosystem of products, infrastructure, modem, chipsets, phones and radios that can serve different use cases. So, that's why we're excited over it. We are not going to see any significant revenues that has an impact on Verizon overall in \u201824. We are going to see that in \u201825, but why it's important is that, this is an area we never been into.  This is a total the new time we can address by running private networks for different industries for different large enterprises across the country with our distribution and technology. I see this is a great opportunity to how we use our spectrum. So that's why we pay a lot of attention to it. And with a lot of opportunities coming through it.  And before Tony talks about the business segment, and the wireless, I would say one main reason why we continue to do is our wireless \u2013 our network is the best. I mean, if you ask any of our enterprise customers or SMB customers, the reliability and the performance of our network is just the best. And that's a very important buying criteria in that segment. Tony? I'm very happy with the choices. I think, as always, when you make a change and we did quite a big change. And I think six out of the eight seats in the leadership team changed in one swoop. I think we had good alignment from the first week. What we need to do, all the way from Kyle, Tony and Sam, Pat which was very important and Joe which is sort of the four operational units. And you can see the results right now. I mean the guys are executing extremely well.  So I'm happy with it. I want to push them even harder but these guys are really good. They take hard pressure and they deliver on it. So, I'm happy on the choices and the team is doing well. Thanks, Kannan. I think on the fixed wireless access we have said a couple of times that we like they read them on 400,000 per quarter, because it's putting our sort of our operations in the right model or deploying this. And as we have also decentralized or regionalized our go to market, we can work with the markets where we actually open for sale fixed-wireless access, work with the local community, work with the local government and also address it through our stores.  We can focus our efforts in that region and see that we capture all the demand and the funnel we have there. So, we think it's a good model that we have right now and that's also there's some loss of physics how quickly we can roll out the C-band. But I can tell you there's no one holding back any investments here in order to get the C-band to our customers as soon as possible.  So, I think, we will continue to look at that and that. I mean, that type of levels going forward, as well. And that will help us with reaching any goalpost we have or whatever goalpost we have communicated to the market. Okay. On the, KPIs, you are correct and we rollout the C-bandwidth we have better retention and better step-ups. And of course, we also expect that we can take share. I think in the consumer side and the business in both sides, we see opportunities as we come with the fixed files access to this market and with the C-band. So there is share gains. We are planning to do here and our teams are very focused on it going forward.  The second question was around fiber. In our ILEC, I guess and we're not holding back on that. I mean, first of all, you saw how great we're doing this quarter with Fios. We'll continue to invest in Fios and see we have our customers. Outside the Fios, our primary strategy is to build on a One Fiber and the fix wireless access to capture the market before anybody else is even the remotely there. That's what we do.  Then over time, as I said hundred times, I got to have optionality if I would have another access technology over time. But that's not in the chords right now. We have all the capacity and the technology out in the fields right now and the quicker we can come out, the quicker we can meet the demand that's out there and meeting the customer that wants our broadband, which is a lot of them. I can talk for ourselves. I think we are in a moment where we actually are monetizing by being very segmented both in our business side and in our consumer side. And that both having the right offers for our customers at the same time we are again raising bottom-line for ourselves. So, I think that's where we are and we have done some price adjustments but that has also included new values for our customers. I think we now are coming to a moment where we are probably going to have a little bit more on quantities not only price given the track that we have in our business right now.  So we're going to balance that out doing the right for our customers, but also doing right for our shareholders. And then, we are of course adding that with our broadband growth which is also helping us. And then, as Tony said, we are taking out cost at the same time. So that's how we work. And that's why we can lift the free cash flow for this year. The guidance even though we're on the high end on our CapEx guidance, as well as higher or headwinds from the interest rate.  So that tells you a little bit how we feel about the business. How we now have the right propositions in a market and we can sort of retooling that if something happen. But right now, we feel confident about the model we have. Yeah. So what we have said before was that we want to come to a ratio of 2.25 over the net debt to EBITDA and we are going to continue to work our way down and that is a primary goal for us. Number one in the capital allocation is to invest in our business. Number two is continue to put our board in a position so they can increase our dividend. We are on 17 years of consecutive increases and thirdly we're paying down our debts. When we come to that ratio, we will start having a conversation about buybacks.  But we want to do buybacks not that one-off or something. It has to be a consecutive program all the time. So, but we're not there yet. But the team is doing great job. Tony talked about the 2.6 billion they we reduced debt this quarter with the tenders were down. So we will continue to do that with the cash flow. That's where we are yielding right now. Before we close, I want to take a moment to address the humanitarian crisis in Israel and Palestine. That has continued to escalate over the past few weeks. At Verizon we stand against terrorism in all its forms and condemn the violence that has claimed the lives of so many innocent civilians. The Verizon Foundation has committed a $2 million donation to organizations supporting relief efforts. And we continue to waive international long distance charges for calls and text from US to the region.  My hope is that we will move to a peaceful resolution as soon as possible. In the meantime, we need to come together as a society and lean into what connects us, not what divides us."

            "content": "Thanks, Hans and good morning. Our results for the third quarter continue to demonstrate our progress towards our three priorities, growing wireless service revenue, and driving EBITDA and free cash flow. As Hans said, we are executing on our plan and remain on track to meet our financial guidance for 2023. We've talked about improving our operational performance while maintaining financial discipline with the third quarter results representing another proof point that demonstrates we can deliver improving key metrics and strong financials.  Consumer postpaid phone net losses totaled $51,000 for the quarter, an improvement of $85,000, sequentially and $138,000 compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we executed well in a low switcher environment, enabling postpaid phone gross add growth of 2.3% year-over-year. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.85% represents a stable result even after implementing over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023.  Our segmented approach to the market and the structure and discipline of our promotional strategy helped to deliver strong postpaid phone gross adds and lower postpaid upgrades. The third quarter's consumer upgrade rate of 3.6% is down 150 basis points year-over-year. The quality of the business we are writing in consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive an elevated premium mix.  Consumer ARPA of $133.47 increased sequentially by 1.2% and year-over-year by 4.5%. We expect to deliver further ARPA growth as a result of the innovations of myPlan, as well as our most recent pricing actions. Verizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 151,000 phone net adds, which as Hans mentioned is our ninth consecutive quarter above 125,000.  While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain and businesses are more cautious than a year ago, mobility continues to be a top investment priority for our Business customers. We expect to continue to deliver strong volumes and expand their relationships by leveraging our position as the wireless market share leader for small and medium businesses, large enterprises and public sector customers.  Moving on to broadband, we delivered 434,000 net additions continuing the pace of over 400,000 net adds for the fourth quarter in a row. Customers are drawn to the quality of our service and overall value proposition for both FWA and Fios. For fixed wireless, gross add expansions grew 384,00 net adds for the quarter growing the base to nearly 2.7 million subscribers.  The addition of the second tranche of C-band spectrum will help us continue our FWA momentum as we work to build a long-term sustainable business. Fios Internet net adds were 72,000, up 11,000 year-over-year.  We are pleased with the success of FiOS with strong gross adds and retention reflecting the quality and overall value of the product. For prepaid, net loss is up $207,000 represents the sequential improvement from the second quarter. We expected a better trajectory for the remainder of the year, as the teams continue to scale some of our key brands such as Visible, and Total by Verizon and execute on our ongoing integration efforts.  Let's now look at our financials. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $33.3 billion, down 2.6% year-over-year. The decline can be attributed to wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 12% lower than the prior year as postpaid upgrades declined 26%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.3 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year and up $217 million sequentially.  Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans and growth and fixed wireless access.  Additionally, as a result of our discipline around promotions and lower upgrade volumes, we saw further reduction in headwinds to service revenue growth associated with promo amortization. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduce total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 60 basis points year-over-year.  Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12.2 billion, an increase of $267 million sequentially and up 0.2%, compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by improved wireless service revenue and lower consumer postpaid upgrades. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items were down approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily due to the lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volumes.  While bad debt is up year-over-year, it was once again flat sequentially consistent with the first half of the year. We continue to make progress on our cost efficiency program, having recently implemented transformations within our consumer, customer care group, as well as business manage services. We are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million of savings in 2023 building momentum to generate incremental savings in 2024.  Adjusted EPS was $1.22 and includes $0.03of pressure from a reduction in capitalized interest due to the early clearance of C-band spectrum. We currently anticipate another incremental $0.03 to $0.04 in the fourth quarter.  Turning the attention to cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was $10.8 billion, bringing the 2023 year-to-date total to $28.8 billion. The year-to-date performance is up approximately $600 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to working capital improvements associated with fewer upgrades and lower inventory levels partially offset by higher interest payments.  Customer payments continue to be healthy with consistent performance throughout the year. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, totaling $14.2 billion year-to-date. At this point, we expect 2023 CapEx to come in at the upper end of our guidance range of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion.  The third quarter was a second consecutive quarter operating at our business as usual runrate. As a result, we would expect a reduction of approximately $4 billion of CapEx in 2023, compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $6.7 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $14.6 billion, a $2.2 billion improvement over the prior year.  As Hans mentioned, we have generated more free cash flow in the first three quarters of this year than in all of 2022. Based on our year-to-date results and the strength of our core business, we are pleased to raise our 2023 free cash flow guidance by $1 billion to more than $18 billion. We are raising guidance even with CapEd at the upper end of our range and absorbing the headwinds from interest expense.  Strong free cash flow provides flexibility and enables us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. As Hans said, within the third quarter, we executed a successful $2.6 billion debt tender, of which a majority was floating rate, while also increasing our dividend once again. Additionally, given our cash position and the performance of the business, this month we paid approximately $3.7 billion of spectrum clearing cost, primarily using operating cash flow. The remaining spectrum payments are minimal and will be made in 2024.  Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $122.2 billion, an improvement of $4.3 billion from the end of second quarter, and $7.1 billion lower year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash on hand, which we are using to pay the clearing cost I just described. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times as of the end of the third quarter, representing a 0.1, churn improvement year-over-year.  Overall, I'm pleased with our ability to deliver stronger operational and financial trends. We are focused on finishing the year strong with continued improvements in volumes and financials, setting us up for meaningful deleveraging opportunities in 2024.  I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions. Hi Phil. Good morning. So on the cash generation, so we're very pleased thus far. I'll start with where we are in the third quarter. So we're pleased with the cash generation of the business. The performance of the business, and as you saw the continued discipline that we had with promos and retention gave us the confidence to raise the free cash flow guide by $1 billion to more than $18 billion. And that's with CapEx at the upper end of the range and also with higher interest expense.  So we feel very good about the balance of the year and are positioning heading into next year. Obviously, we're not going to guide on 2024 at this time, but I can share some qualitative aspects as we look ahead to free cash flow for 2024. On the plus side, we continue to focus the team on an improving EBITDA profile and that's a big focus of the team.  With respect to CapEx, we said a couple of times here in the past that we expect to run at $17 billion to $17.5 billion for 2024, which is back to a business as usual level of spend that you've seen from us. And then we also strive to make continued improvements in working capital. And then offsetting that, we expect higher interest costs from both in the rate environment and the reduction in capitalized interest due to the early clearing of the C-band spectrum.  And then with taxes, as you know, under current legislation, taxes are going to be pressured by the continued phase out of bonus depreciation and we'll see how that plays out. And, so heading into 2024, we continue to focus on strong free cash flow generation and opportunities for meaningful debt reduction. And we don't see any obstacles of Delevering.  Thanks. Okay guys. And Simon, on the - on your question on pricing. So a few things here. We executed a number of pricing actions as you saw. The legacy mix and match that we did earlier in September will yield about a $100 million of incremental benefit in the in the fourth quarter and we also see improving volumes on mobility and year-over-year improvements there. And we also see a an increasing contribution for fixed wireless access. You saw the growth we had in the quarter with 384,000 net adds. We have 2.7, almost 2.7 million subs in our base. So we feel very good about the momentum there. So, very good progress on service revenue and setting us up well for next year. And then, Brett, on the - on your service revenue question, just some qualitative thoughts for you. On the plus side, I would say, look the pricing actions we took this year, obviously have a tailwind in the fourth quarter and carry over into next year. So we continue to see momentum there. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we do expect an improving volume profile in the consumer business. So that's something that the team is very focused on.  Fixed wireless access continues to scale. So, as I mentioned earlier, another 384,000 net adds, even as Hans said, and taking away the discount as well. So the momentum is strong there. And continued increase premium mix with myPlan. So myPlan is seeing roughly 70% premium mix and we're very pleased with the progress there.  And we're also seeing some of the headwinds from the promo amortization starting to ease a little bit, that's starting to flatten out, which is good news. And also a function of all the discipline that we've had this year. And then offsetting that, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, prepaid continues to be a headwind the in the near term as we continue to work to improve the business and that's still ongoing.  So those are the puts and takes in terms of service revenue. Sure. Thanks. And Mike, just a couple of other additional points that Hans mentioned. So, we're on track to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion as Hans said. $200 million to $300 million of that will come this year in 2023 in EBITDA and that was already contemplated in the guide. Hans mentioned a lot of the initiatives. The other item I would mention is we are being very disciplined in business wireline by deemphasizing low margin deals. So that's something that the team is very, very focused on, as well.  We're not going to give cost targets for \u201824 at this time, but we feel good that we have a good foundation that are driving EBITDA improvements and you saw it in the quarter with both sequential and year-over-year improvements in EBITDA that's going to set the foundation for improving EBITDA profile in 2024. And then, Frank on the on the capitalized interest question, in the quarter, we saw about $0.03 of pressure from capitalized interest from the time we got the licenses. And then, for the fourth quarter, we estimate $0.03 to $0.04 of pressure from capitalized interest. So hope that helps. Sure. So, Dave, a couple things. We're pleased again with the strong results from Kyle and the team. We saw a great phone net adds in the quarter, 151,000 and over 430,000 year-to-date. And we saw healthy demand across the board. That would be enterprise public sector and small medium biz. And that performance is in a very uncertain environment and as Hans said, these strong results validate that the businesses continue to trust the Verizon network even during uncertain economic times.  And, we do see certain pressures in certain sectors and we're certainly not immune to it. But we're not seeing anything significant and from a competitive standpoint, I would tell you that we're being very disciplined and we're not going to chase the bad deals that are that are better unprofitable.  The other thing I would mention is FWA volumes also continue at a strong pace and in business. And we had a hundred and 132,000 net adds in the third quarter and over 400,000 year-to-date. So we have great momentum heading into the fourth quarter here and as we set up for next year. Okay. So a few things here. So as, you know, we can't discuss the particular economics of any commercial deal and that includes the commercial deals we have with the cable companies. What I can tell you is that, we are very happy with the MB&O agreements and those agreements are accretive. It's important business for us and as Hans said many times it's consistent with our strategy to monetize the network. It's very profitable business for us.  It's growing and we're very comfortable with the arrangement. But that's as far as we'll go."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website, a detailed review of our second quarter results. You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains committed on delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue, and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cashflow from operation was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow was $5.6 billion. The actions we\u2019re taking to accelerate growth, improve operations, and ensure solid balance sheet, are working. Our results today illustrate our ability to adapt, innovate, and excel, even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments. Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to the hard work and a dedication of our team.  Now, let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks, and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade levels, and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking for ways to do better. In May, we launched myPlan, a first of its kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control, and simplicity they want. This aligns with our strategy of bringing our customer the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped our Verizon Consumer Group deliver notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come for our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we're constantly evolving our offerings to fit customers\u2019 needs. We'll also continue to invest in prepaid to improve performance, and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we've reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high value they place on our services. Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team, support a stronger Verizon where we are the premium provider, with elements like the new myPlan, strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation, and the reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We are strengthening our operational blueprint, with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth. Wireless access had yet another strong quarter, driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance, even as the secular decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon Business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses, and the value of our world class network. On private networks, we won a mandate from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development. The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable broadband performance. This represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our growth trajectory. We have established a high pace of customer growth. It's clear, fixed wireless access is here to stay as a proven competitive broadband product. We're well on track to meet our target of 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers by the end of 2025, from a current base of nearly 2.3 million subscribers. We also now have an opportunity to segment the fixed wireless access market based on price and speed tiers so that our customers can choose the service that best suit them. Further, we continue to see net promoter scores of Fios and fixed wireless access that significantly exceed those of traditional cable offerings. We have the best network in the market. In the next couple of quarters, we will extend our lead with a large tranche of the C-Band spectrum. For the 31st time in a row, Verizon was the most awarded brand for wireless network quality in J.D. Power\u2019s US Wireless Network Quality Study. No other wireless provider has achieved this. And for 2023, we received top scores among all J.D. Power\u2019s study factors in all six regions. Additionally, our team continues to innovate within our network, upgrading our infrastructure around the country, and successfully testing our ability to slice our 5G network. Slicing will allow us to serve customers with dedicated 5G service on a large scale and to meet the diverse needs of the largest base of wireless customers in the United States.  Next, I want to address the recent news about the legacy lead cable in our network. We take these matters seriously, and to be very clear, lead infrastructure makes up a small percentage of our copper network, and we began phasing away from installing new lead cable by the 1950s. At Verizon, the communities we serve and our employees are at the heart of everything we do and we're using a fact and science-based approach in our assessment. You'll hear more on the topic from Tony later on. Our accelerated plans for efficiency with our new structure, which we put in place over the last couple of quarters, are already paying off. Verizon Global Services has taken action on a number of opportunities company-wide, realizing significant savings by focusing on IT platform transformation, leveraging artificial intelligence, rationalizing our real estate portfolio, and improving our supply chains. We're on track to achieve our forecasted $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2025. These savings, in combination with the completion of the $10 billion C-band spend, position us to generate strong cash flow and continue to invest in our business and pursue dividend increases as we execute on our capital allocation strategy.  Now, I will turn the call over to Tony to discuss our operations and financial performance in more detail.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the second quarter demonstrate our progress towards our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, delivering healthy consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and increasing free cash flow. Our focus on execution is working, and we remain on track to meet our financial guidance for 2023. We are happy with our progress, but we have more work to do. We are focused on continuing to improve our performance, while remaining financially disciplined. In the second quarter, our consumer segment demonstrated better operating results, both sequentially and year-over-year in postpaid phone net adds. Additionally, we experienced continued strong performance within our business segment, both in terms of mobility and FWA subscriber growth. The results reflect the benefits of our ongoing C-band deployment and improved go-to-market execution.  Consumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 136,000 for the quarter compared to 215,000 net losses in the second quarter of 2022. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds were strong once again, up 6.9% year-over-year, driven by new-to-Verizon gross adds, which increased approximately 19% over the prior year period. We also saw notable growth in consumer postpaid ARPA, which was up 6.2% year-over-year. The recent launch of myPlan reflects a more segmented and targeted approach. While it's still early, myPlan is driving a significantly higher premium mix, with nearly 70% of myPlan customers taking the Unlimited Plus option. We are also encouraged by the step activity we are seeing. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.76%, up one basis point compared with the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn drove the year-over-year increase, offsetting a modest improvement in voluntary churn. Our involuntary churn rates remain at pre-pandemic levels and were flat for the third consecutive quarter. It is important to note our performance in existing C-band markets. In the 46 markets where we initially deployed C-band, postpaid phone gross add growth was more than 100 basis points higher in the quarter than in non C-band markets. Additionally, phone churn was four basis points lower in C-band markets, and our premium mix in C-band markets was 11 percentage points higher.  Let's now look at our business results. Verizon Business once again delivered solid performance and continues to expand on its industry-leading wireless market share. Demand continues to be strong in all three customer groups, resulting in 144,000 phone net adds for the second quarter, compared to 227,000 for the same period last year, which benefited from some large deals. As Hans mentioned, this marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we have delivered over 125,000 business phone net adds. We continue to win high value business based on the strength of our network performance and value proposition. Notably, we had a recent government contract win where we took share from two of our competitors at attractive ARPUs. Moving on to broadband, we maintained our strong performance, with 418,000 total broadband net additions in the second quarter. In the past four quarters, we've added more than 1.6 million broadband subscribers, growing our total broadband subscriber base by more than 21% during that time. Growth in FWA remained healthy, with 384,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in the prior year period. We now have nearly 2.3 million customers on our FWA product, and we expect growth to continue at a fairly similar pace in the third quarter. On the Fios side, internet net adds for the second quarter were 54,000, up from 36,000 in the second quarter of last year. Despite continued softness in household move activity, gross adds rose year-over-year, and our retention levels continue to be strong. Our value market team continues to take steps to address some of the softness we saw in the first half of the year. Prepaid net losses totaled 304,000 in the second quarter. Our year-to-date net add performance should represent the low point as we continue to make progress integrating TracFone, while taking actions to better position us for growth, including scaling our Visible and Total by Verizon brands. As Hans mentioned, we expect to see sequential improvements beginning in the third quarter. Let's now look at our financials, starting with consolidated revenue for the quarter, which was $32.6 billion, down 3.5% year-over-year. The decline can be attributed to reduced wireless equipment revenue, which was nearly 21% lower than the prior year, as postpaid phone upgrade activity declined 34% versus the same period last year. Service and other revenue grew 0.8%, driven by wireless service revenue growth. Total wireless service revenue was $19.1 billion, up 3.8% year-over-year and more than $200 million sequentially. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from pricing actions, including a recent change to our Verizon Mobile Protect offering. Additionally, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, and growth in fixed wireless access, drove revenue improvements. These benefits were partially offset by continued pressure from the amortization of handset promotions. We are on track to deliver our wireless service revenue guidance for the year. We continue to assess opportunities to take targeted pricing actions to better monetize our products and services as we deliver great value for our customers. For example, we recently announced an increase in our FWA bundle pricing for new customers, which we expect will provide service revenue benefits in the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect less pressure from the amortization and promotional cost in the second half of the year, given the softer upgrade environment and our disciplined approach to promotional spending.  Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12 billion, up 0.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 160 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by lower consumer postpaid upgrade volumes, and improved service revenue. These benefits were partially offset by higher marketing expenses in the quarter related to the myPlan launch, as well as a $194 million increase in bad debt year-over-year. Bad debt was relatively flat from the prior quarter, and payment trends remained consistent with recent quarters and pre-pandemic levels.  Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items, were down 5.9% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volumes. As Hans mentioned, we continue to execute on our cost savings program, including through initiatives within our Verizon Global Services organization. During the quarter, we took actions to rationalize our workforce as we continue to see benefits from rationalizing certain legacy wireline products. We are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million of savings this year from our transformation efforts, and continue to make progress towards achieving our goal of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual cost savings by 2025.  Cashflow from operating activities for the second quarter was $9.7 billion, and for the first half of the year totaled $18 billion, compared to $17.7 billion in the prior year period. The increase continues to be related to working capital improvements associated with lower inventory levels and fewer upgrades, which were offset in part by higher cash income taxes and interest expense. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, which reflects the completion of our $10 billion accelerated C-Band program. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.1 billion, which was over $400 million less than last year. We continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. Our peak capital spend is behind us, and we are now at a business-as-usual run rate for CapEx, which we expect will continue into 2024.  The net result of cashflow from operations and capital spending is free cashflow for the quarter of $5.6 billion. Free cashflow for the first half of the year is $8 billion, a nearly $800 million improvement from the previous year, driven by a combination lower CapEx spend compared to the prior year, and operating cashflow benefits previously mentioned. While we do not normally guideline free cash flow, our strong results give us a clear line of sight to more than $17 billion of free cash flow for the full year.  Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.6 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the end of the previous quarter, and $4.1 billion lower year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash on hand. We are well positioned with respect to our unsecured debt maturities, with no remaining obligations for the rest of the year. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times as of the end of the second quarter, a 0.1 time improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to monitor the current interest rate environment closely given recent comments from the Federal Reserve on planned rate increases later in the year. As previously stated, we expect higher interest expense to impact our full year earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30, and there's no change to that view. Our strong second quarter results support our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged.  Before I hand the call back to Hans, I'd like to address the recent media reports on lead sheath cables in our network. Here is what we currently know. We still have some legacy lead sheath cable in our copper network. As a result of the age of this infrastructure and the history of the industry, records are incomplete as to exactly how much of the cable at our network has led sheathing. However, to give you a sense of the scale of the infrastructure we are talking about, our copper network is comprised of less than 540,000 miles of cable, roughly half of which is aerial, and lead sheath cable makes up a small percentage of our copper network. This number excludes the network elements previously owned by MCI and XO communications because we are still reviewing the historical records of those companies. When not disturbed, the likelihood of exposure to lead from lead sheath cables is low. In addition, because the lead sheath cable was used as a feeder and distribution cable and does not run into individual homes or apartments, it is generally in locations that minimize the potential for public contact. We are working with a third party expert to conduct our own testing at our sites that were identified by the media. We will not have the results of our testing for several weeks. When we have the results of our testing, we will work closely with our industry and others to address any concerns and issues.  Now, I think it's important to address a question we've received from a lot of investors, which is about the process for and potential cost of removal of the lead sheath cable in our network. Given where we are in this process, it is far too soon to make any projection on what the potential financial impact might be to the company. There are a number of unknowns in this area, including whether there is a health risk presented by undisturbed lead sheath cable, and if there is a risk, how that risk should be addressed. As a result, we do not believe there's a meaningful way to estimate any potential cost to the company or that any such estimate would even be useful. We won't be able to provide any additional color during the Q&A session. As we have more information we can share on the topic, we will certainly do that.  I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. As we pass the midpoint of 2023, I'm pleased by how we're effectively delivering on our priorities, and I'm confident that we will meet the financial goals we set for ourselves for the full year. To summarize, in mobility, our segmented and disciplined approach to the market is working, and our efforts to improve the consumer group's performance will continue throughout the second half of the year. In broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning as we capitalize on the unique strength and capabilities of both technologies. We continue to have the best network in the market, and our leadership position will only get stronger as we continue to roll out C-band. While we're encouraged by the quarter\u2019s results, there's more work to be done. My leadership team and I are laser focused on delivering what we committed to you at top of the year, strong wireless service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, as well as meeting our 2023 financial guidance.  By that, I hand it over to Brady for questions. \nBrady Connor: Okay. Thanks, Hans. Brad, we\u2019re ready to take the first question. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Looks like a nice beat on the consumer side, really driven by the postpaid ARPA growth of about 6%. Could you guys sort of pull that apart a little bit and maybe talk about the sustainability of that and the service revenue growth you saw as we head into the second half? I mean, I think you've got some - you lapsed some price increases, but you've got some other price increases coming through and some of the promotional stuff rolling off. And then maybe just quickly on the lead, obviously you guys can't quantify it, but when you guys say low exposure of the 540,000 miles of copper, is that single-digit? Can you guys tighten up that number for us a little bit? That'd be great. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, John. Let me start with the service revenue. I think we have been extremely focused on the service revenue. As you\u2019re seeing this quarter, we are expanding the growth from the first quarter, but it's many components. I understand you want to know a little bit more about the ARPA expansion, but we definitely see the broadband is adding to our growth. And then of course, our wireless business side is doing extremely well as well, I mean, eighth quarter we\u2019re on 125,000. So, we're actually doing a lot of things in different areas. But then if you go to the consumer group, they have been really good the last couple of quarters right now to be segmenting, targeting the right offering with the right pricing for the customers. And myPlan has been playing in very well to that. And as you heard Tony talking about, 70% are taking the premium plan. So, but that's just the start of it. We're not done, but clearly I\u2019m confident that the team knows how to manage this given how much we invested in research on the consumer side to understand our consumers better. And that's why we launched myPlan. So, all in all, I have to say, the guys are doing well. I'm confident we'll continue on this stride, but maybe Tony can give you some more on that and then we can come back to the lead. \nTony Skiadas: Yes, thanks, Hans. Good morning, John. So, on the service revenue, we're very confident in the guide. You mentioned tough comps that we face in the second half. When you think about the second half of the year, let me unpack some of the drivers for you. As you know, we executed a number of targeted pricing actions between the price ups on the Legacy Unlimited plans that we did earlier in the quarter, as well as most recently changes to our handset insurance program and price changes on FWA bundles. Secondly, we had the introduction of myPlan back in May. That's helped with premium mix and you heard that we're roughly 70% taking the Unlimited Plus plan. As Hans mentioned, we see an increase in contribution from fixed wireless access. We have 2.3 million subs in the base, and we have great momentum on FWA. And then fourth, we see continued improvements in year-over-year consumer postpaid volumes, and you saw that in the quarter. And then lastly, when you think about the promo amortization, the revenue impact from promotions and the promo amortization has decelerated in recent quarters, and that's - it's basically a function of our disciplined approach to promotions and retention. So, when you put that all together, we're very confident that all the initiatives here will continue to drive the meaningful revenue growth in the second half. \nHans Vestberg: On the lead, as I said, we take this matter very seriously, and we're doing exactly what you expect from Verizon. We're doing this scientific and fact-based. As Tony said, we're going over the different places that we pointed out by media and doing our own measurements with internal and external experts. And that's where we are. And we will do this very thorough. We are always doing things thorough. We do it fact-based, scientific, and that's how we're going to do, and that's what you should expect from us. \nTony Skiadas: Yes, and to add on to that, John, we're still reviewing the records, and we mentioned that we're still reviewing the historical records of the former MCI and XO network. So, that work is still ongoing as well. So, we still have more work to do there, and as we learn more, we'll keep you updated.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, John. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question, and I think I'll follow up on consumer volumes you alluded to in responding to John. It was great to see the consumer phone losses improve year-over-year. But I know your ambition is to do better than that. How do you think about path, getting back to net growth in consumer postpaid phones? Do you think you're going to need to take further actions in terms of the product mix or pricing or even any additional internal adjustments, or do you think you have the pieces in place and it's really just a matter of driving better execution against that framework? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I think it's about execution on the framework we have built right now. The guys have everything. Sampath and the team, together with Tony and me, they have the full support. We have a new platform in myPlan. We're segmented up the market. We work with financial discipline. The target we have, our team is continue to do sequential growth. And as you recall, Sampath and the team said before, ultimately, we want our fair share also on the net adds. But ultimately, we measure ourself on service revenue growth. And as you can see, we continue to improve that. So, it's more about now executing on this, being patient and see that both the network is the best in the market, but it's just improving. And some of the numbers that Tony talked about, you see the impact we have when the C-band is coming out. And then myPlan, you also see that is now initially what we have talked about is actually giving us really good confidence that we're in the right place. So, all that is in place. And then we do the regionalization as well at the same time. So, a lot of things is in place. It's more about execution and doing it with a financial discipline that you should expect from Verizon.\nBrett Feldman: And how do we think about a timeline for getting to sustainably positive net adds in consumer? Is that something that would be a reasonable expectation once you have C-band fully deployed?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Hi, Brett, it's Tony. So, volumes are important to the business, and as we said before, we're going to be very disciplined on how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. It's too soon to call third quarter positive for consumer. But as we said, we expect improvements year-over-year in consumer net adds. And the team and Sampath and the team are very focused on that.\nBrett Feldman: All right, thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you very much. Good morning. I wanted to come back to the second phase of C-band. It was helpful to get those statistics. Could you just help us a little bit more in terms of what this is going to mean in terms of your footprint, both on the wireless side and on the fixed wireless side? How do we think that's going to help both coverage and also capacity? I know there's concerns in some quarters about fixed wireless facing congestion. It'd be great to let us know what your experience has been with usage and how you feel good about handling that 4 million to 5 million and beyond over the next few years. And then maybe a quick one for Tony. Obviously, the stock's been under some pressure here, pretty high yield. Perhaps remind us about how you're thinking about potentially going to buybacks. You're seeing some deleveraging now, strong free cash flow. Is that going to be an option here in the not-too-distant future? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Simon. When it comes to the C-band, I said we\u2019re ahead of the plan. As soon as we get hold of the next tranche of spectrum, the team is ready to continue to deploy that. That's going to give us both more capacity, but of course more coverage as well. So, it gives us both. And as you have seen the numbers we talk about here, as soon as we deploy C-band, we get better uptake from our wireless customers. And of course, we'll open up fixed wireless access. So, that should be positive over time for us. And when it comes to this lingering question about capacity, we don't have any capacity problems. I mean, the guys are doing an enormously good job, as always when it comes to Verizon and capacity network planning. Joe and the team are on it all the time and seeing that we're doing the right for our customers. And remember, we are building a multipurpose network. That means that we have one radio that serve multiple opportunities, wireless, fixed wireless access, in some cases private networks. So, all that is in one, and that's efficiency and the scale we're bringing right now, which we expected when we start with 5G and the C-band to see that we get the leverage model over time. But of course, it's going to roll out over the next year. So, I\u2019m confident that this will create more opportunities for us now when we get hold of the next tranche of the C-band spectrum. \nTony Skiadas: Okay, Simon. And then on your question on the cash generation here, we're very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which was very strong and reflective of our strong free cash flow results that is running higher than normal. As a reminder, we do have about $4.5 billion of the C-band clearing obligations remaining and due soon, and that's obviously a priority for us. The cash generation, as I said, is strong, gives us optionality and supports a much-improved dividend payout ratio. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We said first we would invest in the business. The second priority is our commitment to the dividend. Our third priority is to delever, and you'll see us be focused on that. And then once we get to the leverage metric of 2.25, we will consider buybacks at that time.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks so much. \nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, Simon. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next the next question comes Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thanks. With the price increases and the impact of the new pricing structure, it looks like you're trending above the midpoint of service revenue growth. I mean, could be closer to the high end. Any reason to think it decelerates from here? And then second, Hans, you spoke on private wireless. Can you dig into the market opportunity there and how long it takes for that to be a billion-dollar business? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I\u2019ll start with the second question and Tony can come back on the first. On the private wireless, what we have found out during the work we've been doing is that private 5G networks is something really, really valuable for enterprises and SMBs. And the main reason is that the capacity on it, the speed and the security, it basically starts as a Wi-Fi replacement on the license spectrum, and then you start adding onto it. It usually start with one factory, and if you see that it\u2019s working there, they do it in all factories. We have a growing list of new customers coming in, in the first phase. I would say this is a new business for us that again, is building on the same investment, the same Verizon Intelligent Edge network. I don't think we should expect that it's a billion-dollar business this year, but that definitely over time, this is a very important lever for Kyle and his team for growth in the service revenue and actually doing even better with enterprises. So, it's going to take some time, but I\u2019m really pleased what I've seen in the last couple of quarters how this is turning out. And I would say we have now an ecosystem with devices, with radio-based stations, with integrators and all of that, which we haven't had before. So, I'm more optimistic than a long time that private networks will be something. And as you know, I mean, we were way ahead of anybody else on this field, and that's why I feel really confident we will take more than our fair share.\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Good morning, Phil. And then on the service revenue, as we mentioned upfront, we have some tough comps as we lap the price ups from last year. We do expect sequential improvements in the third quarter. One thing to note, just on the prepaid revenue, we did see a headwind in the quarter of about $125 million. I would expect that to be at a similar level in the third quarter before it eases up in the fourth quarter. That's probably one additional data point for you.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, Tony.\nBrady Connor: Yep. Thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open, sir.\nFrank Louthan: Great, thank you. Can you walk us through the correlation between the broadband adds and the business wireless adds, including both the Fios and the fixed wireless? And then you mentioned expecting some softer upgrades. Are you anticipating having to subsidize anymore for handsets to get adds as the year goes on? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: On the broadband side, I think I got the question like that, the correlation between the fixed wireless access and the Fios. I mean, let me say that, I mean, on the fixed wild access right now, we are growing that base, of course, mainly outside the (indiscernible) because that's just how it is because the Fios is so strong. So, we're doing great on the Fios business. And as you've seen, even though it's a softer housing movement season than before, we're doing great. I mean, over 50,000 again on Fios. So, Fios is doing really well. And then of course we have a portion of converged customers that is now growing. It's not growing that to come to European levels or something, but it's growing. The good thing for us is we have owners\u2019 economics on everything, fixed wireless access, wireless, Fios. We have one network with our own fiber. And that, of course, gives us opportunity to meet customer demands if they want convergence or not, and that nobody else has in the industry. So, really pleased with the development of broadband for us. We outlined this as one of the most important 5G innovations we've done. We add substantial new customers there. So, now this is a great opportunity there. And as you saw right now, we continue doing as we've done. I mean, we have now 2.3 billion customers on fixed wireless access. We can now start with different tiers, different pricings, so we can meet customer demands that have different requirements. And that's just good for us, but it's also really good for our customers because they can choose between different models depending on what needs to have.\nTony Skiadas: Yes, the only thing I would add is that we have a great rhythm at 400,000 broadband net adds in the quarter. And again, the third consecutive quarter of over 400,000 broadband net adds. And we continue to see good momentum with customers taking - wireless customers taking FWA and we see great progress there as well.\nHans Vestberg: And then you had a question on upgrades, and as you've seen in promos, that is clearly down in the second quarter and the first quarter as well. There are many reasons for it. Some are, of course, that we are much more financially disciplined. That's very important. But it also has haven't been any major new devices coming out. It'll probably come one in the second half. It usually comes. So, we're going to see that. But I don't foresee that we will come back to the levels we've seen before from a point of view of Verizon. We think that we are going to be disciplined. We're going to offer devices and promos and upgrades where there's the best for the segment and for the customer, but we'll not come back to the levels that we saw before.\nFrank Louthan: All right, great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, Frank. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. So, I wanted to come back to the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry. Before the lead, this was the big issue. And there were two pillars to the idea behind the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry. One was that somehow, Verizon had negotiated a deal with the cable industry that they would guarantee to make money no matter how much data cable consumers took. And the second was that that deal would never end. It was going to be forever. And so, I feel like the messaging on that has started to change from Verizon a little bit, and that maybe that the idea that cable industry's guaranteed to make money in the relationship between Verizon and cable, regardless of data consumption, that that's not true, and that this deal isn't permanent, that it could change at some future time, even though the DOJ - obviously, you need to have some deal, but it doesn't have to be this deal. And I was wondering if you could kind of just address that for us right now. Thank you,\nHans Vestberg: David, thank you for the question. This is a complex area. And remember, many of these things we cannot talk about. We have MDAs when it comes to a contract. The only thing that I'm securing is that Verizon making money on this. That, I can tell you. And we think this is an important business. These are important customers to us. And again, I go back to what I talked about before. We build the network once. The more connections, the more usage, and the more revenue we have on it, the better return on capital it is. And as long as we see that happening, we will continue the work we're doing. However, I cannot go into specifics on the contracts because first of all, I'm not allowed to do it. But clearly, you should feel confident that Verizon is doing that with the best interest of our stakeholders and our shareholders. So, and we want to get the best return on our invested capital in the network.\nDavid Barden: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open, sir.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good morning. Two questions if I could. First, just following up on the comments around tiering of fixed wireless and potentially on speed. Is there also an opportunity to begin tiering mobile 5G wireless in terms of megabits per second rather than a historical way of tiering on gigabytes per month of consumption? And then just secondly, you mentioned that the cash CapEx is tracking to guidance, but just curious, as you're deploying the mid band spectrum, the depth of it and seeing what the propagation is, are there opportunities to get further efficiencies in capital and potentially go below the business-as-usual indication of CapEx for 2024? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Hey, Mike, thank you for the question. On the question about different models over time, how we can charge for 5G, I think we find a good model within myPlan right now, with different type of network options. Then you can take your perks. All of it is accretive for us. You should just see the first sort of launch here as the first time we come out with a platform. We see multiple opportunities, how you can sort of diverse that one in different ways to meet different customer demand. So, you will probably see more of that going forward. I will do that. So, clearly, very important to us that we continue to meet our customers with new plans and things like that. But now we have a great base that is myPlan. On the CapEx side, I think we have gone over sort of a fairly long hump here, coming from Verizon Intelligent Edge network, investing in fiber, investing to in all the parts on millimeter wave, then coming into the hump of C-band. Now, we\u2019re coming into the BAU. As far as we can see right now is BAU is around 17 to 17.5, and that's going to see that we can deploy the C-band, getting all the benefits we talked about. 4G is coming down. Fiber is more success-based. So, there's a lot of things happening in there, but we're really confident that we can be on those levels and our team is really doing a great job. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Great. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead, sir.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Two questions if I could. First, if I could return to the lead topic for one moment. Can you just talk about the extent to which you used over-lashing of fiber to what might potentially be lead cables, particularly in your aerial plant in the Northeast? And then second, I just wonder if you could just help us think about the trajectory going forward of fixed wireless, which has seemingly sort of steadied out to a relatively stable number. Is that what we should expect? Because that would take us a bit higher than your guidance by the end of 2025. So, I'm just wondering how we think about the pacing of fixed wireless.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. I\u2019ll start with the fixed wireless access question because I think that is an important one, and the lead, we will hear from Tony on that one. On the fixed wireless access, you are right. I mean, we are now running on a fairly high level, adding a broadband subscriber quota. Remember, we have defined, we are roughly in, I would say, a little bit over 70 of the PEAs of C-band so far out of 402. So, that, of course, is how many OFS are open for sales we can do right now. So, that is a little bit. The next step going to be the next tranche coming in. And I said, we're well ahead to the 4 million to 5 million. The team is doing a great job. You also saw that we now are doing some great work on how we can address MDUs in a very efficient way. We're in the beginning of that. So, all in all, I think that fixed wireless access and how we\u2019re managing our network is going great. And of course, as a ambitious leader as I am, I expect that we can do better, of course. But right now, that's the forecast we have to 4 million to 5 million, and we're really doing well. And this customer satisfaction on fixed wireless access is so good. It's so simple. You install it yourself, you get broadband immediately. So, we are just meeting a consumer demand that no one else is doing, basically. So, I'm really pleased with the product. We talked about this being one of the most important 5G applications, and now you can see what it means to us and how important it's going to be over time.\nTony Skiadas: And then Craig, on the lead, as we said earlier, it's a small part of our network. It's about 50% aerial. We said we're still reviewing the historical records, both former MCI network and the former XO copper network. So, we still have work to do there. We're going to take a very methodical approach, very fact-based, very scientific-based approach. And as we know everyone wants more information, and as we learn more, we'll keep you updated. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Craig. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I want to ask too, if I could, I guess first just on the lead issue, I was wondering if you thought this might lead to an acceleration in copper network retirements and therefore an accelerated reduction in fixed costs for legacy networks. It seems like an opportunity in cases where communities might want to not have lead cable in their communities, even if it isn't actually shedding any lead. And then secondly, I just had a follow up to Simon's question earlier. Can you talk about how the remaining C-band deployments will affect the fixed wireless opportunity in rural areas? Specifically, how much of an expansion in the rural footprint will that represent versus the available footprint today for fixed wireless? And would that include a lot of areas that aren't served by anything today except for copper infrastructure? So, kind of the true rural areas. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: So, on the first one, we have always a plan for network transformation that is continuously ongoing. That has not changed. When it comes to this lead sheathed cables discussion, I said, I mean, we are going to go through this scientific. We're going to do tests. We're going to do it fact-based, and then we'll come back. But we have a normal network transformation that we constantly do because Kyle and team are doing that in order to keep up with the pressure of the secular decline in wireline. So, he will continue to do that, and we do that all the time. On the second question on fixed wireless access, yes, of course, when we - the first 70-ish, I would say, C-band mark PAEs, that is called, they are mainly in urban areas. And that's where we have had that good traction on fixed wireless access. And the next step is going to be much more suburban and rural. And of course, that's great opportunities because usually there are even less different options for customers in those areas. So, of course, that's going to create opportunity for us. That doesn't mean that we're changing our guidance. We still say 4 million to 5 million by 2025. Of course, the team is always driving hard here, and I'm driving hard. We always want to achieve. We want to show our stakeholders that we're a great company and we execute well, which I think we're doing. So, definitely, we see opportunities to be coming with the next tranche of C-band.\nBryan Kraft: Great. Thank you very much, Hans. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.\nTim Horan: Thanks. On the wholesale on the cable side, maybe just discuss wholesale wireless ARPUs broadly speaking. Do you think you can grow wholesale wireless ARPUs? And then the $10 increase in fixed wireless pricing, do you think that would slow kind of sub growth quarterly? We\u2019ve seen obviously good strength there. And then lastly, on the lead side, can you just qualitatively talk, how often are your workers exposed to lead? I\u2019m sure you have to log that. And what do you do to kind of protect workers, and have you ever seen any claims from workers on lead poisoning? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: There were many questions in all there. So, let me start with the change of discounts that we did on fixed wireless access. Again, we have a premium product. We have different type of optionalities for our customers in order to pick and choose what the best tier is or what the best service is. So, we think that this is just natural when you have passed over 2 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. And I think - just think about when we started with Unlimited, you start with one plan, and then you start to work with different segmentation, because ultimately we are in a very, very big consumer business where so many differentiated customers that needs different type of services. So, just think about it as a very natural step for us in order to serve our customers in a good way. Then I hand it over to Tony for the next question.\nTony Skiadas: Yes. On the cable partnership. I mean, as Hans mentioned, we don't go into the details. I mean, we continue to see volume growth in the relationship. And we're very satisfied with the relationship, and we continue to monetize the network, as Hans said earlier. \nTim Horan: And then on the worker lead exposure.\nTony Skiadas: We continue to work across the company and continue to take a methodical approach. We're not going to get into any specifics around employees or anything, but as we said, we'll keep you posted as we learn more. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Tim. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Sir, you may go ahead.\nPeter Supino: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask two questions, one on upgrade rates and the other on FWA. On upgrade rates, I wondered if you could discuss why they've fallen so much and whether it's sustainable, what the risks are to recent trend. And on FWA, just wonder if you could discuss the service price increase that we learned about this week. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. On the upgrade rates, as I said before, I mean, first of all, we at Verizon have been very disciplined in how to offer sort of products and services with the right price at the right time. So, definitely, that has been that we are actually doing less promos and less upgrades. That has not hampered our way of growing our business or taking customers. And we will continue to work with that. Then, of course, hasn't been any major product coming out in the market. We expect that it's going to be a product coming out in the second half. We are excited over that. And of course, that's going to drive upgrades and promos of course. But again, we will continue to be very financially disciplined. But of course, we're excited for these type of things as it attracts store traffic, and when traffic comes, we are really good. And having good conversion rates, adding things to it to our customers, which is really, really important. And second, on the fixed wireless access, taking away the discount, and again, we come to a level of 2.3 million fixed wireless access customer. There are so many different type of customers and consumers we have. So, of course, having different tiers and pricings becomes very normal in order to meet customer demands. So, it\u2019s just how we do, and that we\u2019ll continue to do and see how the market is developing.\nPeter Supino: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Okay. Hey, Brad, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: The final question for today, we'll come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Your line is open, sir.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks, Hans. I just want to actually do a follow up to that upgrade question. I think the last two years \u2026\nOperator: Walter, please check the mute button on your phone.\nHans Vestberg: We can hear you, Walter.\nBrady Connor: We can hear you, Walt. Go.\nWalter Piecyk: You can hear me? \nBrady Connor: Yes. \nWalter Piecyk: Okay. I don't know why he was telling me to check Maybe he was trying to mute me. So, the last two years. Hans, the upgrade rate has actually declined in the third quarter. So, I just want to kind of piecemeal together, like you said, you're not going to do handset promotions earlier in the call. Obviously, everyone knows Apple comes out with a new product, but in the last answer, it sounded like you thought people would upgrade more, but what seasonal trend should we see here? I assume you're still expecting it to be down year-on-year, but what about sequentially, because it's been typically down sequentially in the third quarter for the last two quarters. Maybe Covid had some impact on that, I don't know. And then my second question on CapEx. There's some debate, I think a lot of the tower companies specifically are trying to drive this narrative of like, oh, your C-band's going to get deployed, but they're doing fixed wireless and all these things. You're going to have to come back and do densification very quickly. So, any lull in CapEx will be short-lived. I'm just curious, I mean, obviously we saw the CapEx drop very quickly here in this quarter. How long do you think this kind of CapEx holiday will exist before you need to come back and use densification in the absence of additional spectrum sourced by the FCC? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, thank you. On the upgrade, I cannot - I don't know anything about any launch or the product, how exciting it's going to be, but ultimate, that usage usually drive more upgrades. So, let's see what's going to happen this time and when it comes out. But we're always excited to see Apple coming out with a new phone. Hopefully, they're coming in this one. I cannot reveal what they are doing, but clearly, we're excited for that. On the CapEx, yes, you should talk to us. We know more about this than other companies. I would say we have a really good sustainable level of this. Densification is part of our strategy already. So, and many of the things that we already are deploying on C-band, we deploy sort of for the full spectrum already from the beginning. Then we turn on when we get those tranches. So, there's a lot of things that my team has done over years in order to be as efficient as possible with CapEx. That's why I feel really good on our sort of BAU around 17 to 17.5. I feel really good about that because we go through the extremely detail. So, we feel confident.\nWalter Piecyk: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Walt. Brad, that was all the time we had for today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains committed on delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue, and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cashflow from operation was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow was $5.6 billion. The actions we're taking to accelerate growth, improve operations, and ensure solid balance sheet, are working. Our results today illustrate our ability to adapt, innovate, and excel, even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments. Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to the hard work and a dedication of our team.  Now, let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks, and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade levels, and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking for ways to do better. In May, we launched myPlan, a first of its kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control, and simplicity they want. This aligns with our strategy of bringing our customer the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped our Verizon Consumer Group deliver notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come for our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we're constantly evolving our offerings to fit customers' needs. We'll also continue to invest in prepaid to improve performance, and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we've reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high value they place on our services. Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team, support a stronger Verizon where we are the premium provider, with elements like the new myPlan, strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation, and the reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We are strengthening our operational blueprint, with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth. Wireless access had yet another strong quarter, driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance, even as the secular decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon Business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses, and the value of our world class network. On private networks, we won a mandate from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development. The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable broadband performance. This represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our growth trajectory. We have established a high pace of customer growth. It's clear, fixed wireless access is here to stay as a proven competitive broadband product. We're well on track to meet our target of 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers by the end of 2025, from a current base of nearly 2.3 million subscribers. We also now have an opportunity to segment the fixed wireless access market based on price and speed tiers so that our customers can choose the service that best suit them. Further, we continue to see net promoter scores of Fios and fixed wireless access that significantly exceed those of traditional cable offerings. We have the best network in the market. In the next couple of quarters, we will extend our lead with a large tranche of the C-Band spectrum. For the 31st time in a row, Verizon was the most awarded brand for wireless network quality in J.D. Power's US Wireless Network Quality Study. No other wireless provider has achieved this. And for 2023, we received top scores among all J.D. Power's study factors in all six regions. Additionally, our team continues to innovate within our network, upgrading our infrastructure around the country, and successfully testing our ability to slice our 5G network. Slicing will allow us to serve customers with dedicated 5G service on a large scale and to meet the diverse needs of the largest base of wireless customers in the United States.  Next, I want to address the recent news about the legacy lead cable in our network. We take these matters seriously, and to be very clear, lead infrastructure makes up a small percentage of our copper network, and we began phasing away from installing new lead cable by the 1950s. At Verizon, the communities we serve and our employees are at the heart of everything we do and we're using a fact and science-based approach in our assessment. You'll hear more on the topic from Tony later on. Our accelerated plans for efficiency with our new structure, which we put in place over the last couple of quarters, are already paying off. Verizon Global Services has taken action on a number of opportunities company-wide, realizing significant savings by focusing on IT platform transformation, leveraging artificial intelligence, rationalizing our real estate portfolio, and improving our supply chains. We're on track to achieve our forecasted $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2025. These savings, in combination with the completion of the $10 billion C-band spend, position us to generate strong cash flow and continue to invest in our business and pursue dividend increases as we execute on our capital allocation strategy.  Now, I will turn the call over to Tony to discuss our operations and financial performance in more detail. Thank you, Tony. As we pass the midpoint of 2023, I'm pleased by how we're effectively delivering on our priorities, and I'm confident that we will meet the financial goals we set for ourselves for the full year. To summarize, in mobility, our segmented and disciplined approach to the market is working, and our efforts to improve the consumer group's performance will continue throughout the second half of the year. In broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning as we capitalize on the unique strength and capabilities of both technologies. We continue to have the best network in the market, and our leadership position will only get stronger as we continue to roll out C-band. While we're encouraged by the quarter's results, there's more work to be done. My leadership team and I are laser focused on delivering what we committed to you at top of the year, strong wireless service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, as well as meeting our 2023 financial guidance.  By that, I hand it over to Brady for questions. Thank you, John. Let me start with the service revenue. I think we have been extremely focused on the service revenue. As you're seeing this quarter, we are expanding the growth from the first quarter, but it's many components. I understand you want to know a little bit more about the ARPA expansion, but we definitely see the broadband is adding to our growth. And then of course, our wireless business side is doing extremely well as well, I mean, eighth quarter we're on 125,000. So, we're actually doing a lot of things in different areas. But then if you go to the consumer group, they have been really good the last couple of quarters right now to be segmenting, targeting the right offering with the right pricing for the customers. And myPlan has been playing in very well to that. And as you heard Tony talking about, 70% are taking the premium plan. So, but that's just the start of it. We're not done, but clearly I'm confident that the team knows how to manage this given how much we invested in research on the consumer side to understand our consumers better. And that's why we launched myPlan. So, all in all, I have to say, the guys are doing well. I'm confident we'll continue on this stride, but maybe Tony can give you some more on that and then we can come back to the lead. On the lead, as I said, we take this matter very seriously, and we're doing exactly what you expect from Verizon. We're doing this scientific and fact-based. As Tony said, we're going over the different places that we pointed out by media and doing our own measurements with internal and external experts. And that's where we are. And we will do this very thorough. We are always doing things thorough. We do it fact-based, scientific, and that's how we're going to do, and that's what you should expect from us. I think it's about execution on the framework we have built right now. The guys have everything. Sampath and the team, together with Tony and me, they have the full support. We have a new platform in myPlan. We're segmented up the market. We work with financial discipline. The target we have, our team is continue to do sequential growth. And as you recall, Sampath and the team said before, ultimately, we want our fair share also on the net adds. But ultimately, we measure ourself on service revenue growth. And as you can see, we continue to improve that. So, it's more about now executing on this, being patient and see that both the network is the best in the market, but it's just improving. And some of the numbers that Tony talked about, you see the impact we have when the C-band is coming out. And then myPlan, you also see that is now initially what we have talked about is actually giving us really good confidence that we're in the right place. So, all that is in place. And then we do the regionalization as well at the same time. So, a lot of things is in place. It's more about execution and doing it with a financial discipline that you should expect from Verizon. Thank you, Simon. When it comes to the C-band, I said we're ahead of the plan. As soon as we get hold of the next tranche of spectrum, the team is ready to continue to deploy that. That's going to give us both more capacity, but of course more coverage as well. So, it gives us both. And as you have seen the numbers we talk about here, as soon as we deploy C-band, we get better uptake from our wireless customers. And of course, we'll open up fixed wireless access. So, that should be positive over time for us. And when it comes to this lingering question about capacity, we don't have any capacity problems. I mean, the guys are doing an enormously good job, as always when it comes to Verizon and capacity network planning. Joe and the team are on it all the time and seeing that we're doing the right for our customers. And remember, we are building a multipurpose network. That means that we have one radio that serve multiple opportunities, wireless, fixed wireless access, in some cases private networks. So, all that is in one, and that's efficiency and the scale we're bringing right now, which we expected when we start with 5G and the C-band to see that we get the leverage model over time. But of course, it's going to roll out over the next year. So, I'm confident that this will create more opportunities for us now when we get hold of the next tranche of the C-band spectrum. I'll start with the second question and Tony can come back on the first. On the private wireless, what we have found out during the work we've been doing is that private 5G networks is something really, really valuable for enterprises and SMBs. And the main reason is that the capacity on it, the speed and the security, it basically starts as a Wi-Fi replacement on the license spectrum, and then you start adding onto it. It usually start with one factory, and if you see that it's working there, they do it in all factories. We have a growing list of new customers coming in, in the first phase. I would say this is a new business for us that again, is building on the same investment, the same Verizon Intelligent Edge network. I don't think we should expect that it's a billion-dollar business this year, but that definitely over time, this is a very important lever for Kyle and his team for growth in the service revenue and actually doing even better with enterprises. So, it's going to take some time, but I'm really pleased what I've seen in the last couple of quarters how this is turning out. And I would say we have now an ecosystem with devices, with radio-based stations, with integrators and all of that, which we haven't had before. So, I'm more optimistic than a long time that private networks will be something. And as you know, I mean, we were way ahead of anybody else on this field, and that's why I feel really confident we will take more than our fair share. On the broadband side, I think I got the question like that, the correlation between the fixed wireless access and the Fios. I mean, let me say that, I mean, on the fixed wild access right now, we are growing that base, of course, mainly outside the (indiscernible) because that's just how it is because the Fios is so strong. So, we're doing great on the Fios business. And as you've seen, even though it's a softer housing movement season than before, we're doing great. I mean, over 50,000 again on Fios. So, Fios is doing really well. And then of course we have a portion of converged customers that is now growing. It's not growing that to come to European levels or something, but it's growing. The good thing for us is we have owners' economics on everything, fixed wireless access, wireless, Fios. We have one network with our own fiber. And that, of course, gives us opportunity to meet customer demands if they want convergence or not, and that nobody else has in the industry. So, really pleased with the development of broadband for us. We outlined this as one of the most important 5G innovations we've done. We add substantial new customers there. So, now this is a great opportunity there. And as you saw right now, we continue doing as we've done. I mean, we have now 2.3 billion customers on fixed wireless access. We can now start with different tiers, different pricings, so we can meet customer demands that have different requirements. And that's just good for us, but it's also really good for our customers because they can choose between different models depending on what needs to have. And then you had a question on upgrades, and as you've seen in promos, that is clearly down in the second quarter and the first quarter as well. There are many reasons for it. Some are, of course, that we are much more financially disciplined. That's very important. But it also has haven't been any major new devices coming out. It'll probably come one in the second half. It usually comes. So, we're going to see that. But I don't foresee that we will come back to the levels we've seen before from a point of view of Verizon. We think that we are going to be disciplined. We're going to offer devices and promos and upgrades where there's the best for the segment and for the customer, but we'll not come back to the levels that we saw before. David, thank you for the question. This is a complex area. And remember, many of these things we cannot talk about. We have MDAs when it comes to a contract. The only thing that I'm securing is that Verizon making money on this. That, I can tell you. And we think this is an important business. These are important customers to us. And again, I go back to what I talked about before. We build the network once. The more connections, the more usage, and the more revenue we have on it, the better return on capital it is. And as long as we see that happening, we will continue the work we're doing. However, I cannot go into specifics on the contracts because first of all, I'm not allowed to do it. But clearly, you should feel confident that Verizon is doing that with the best interest of our stakeholders and our shareholders. So, and we want to get the best return on our invested capital in the network. Hey, Mike, thank you for the question. On the question about different models over time, how we can charge for 5G, I think we find a good model within myPlan right now, with different type of network options. Then you can take your perks. All of it is accretive for us. You should just see the first sort of launch here as the first time we come out with a platform. We see multiple opportunities, how you can sort of diverse that one in different ways to meet different customer demand. So, you will probably see more of that going forward. I will do that. So, clearly, very important to us that we continue to meet our customers with new plans and things like that. But now we have a great base that is myPlan. On the CapEx side, I think we have gone over sort of a fairly long hump here, coming from Verizon Intelligent Edge network, investing in fiber, investing to in all the parts on millimeter wave, then coming into the hump of C-band. Now, we're coming into the BAU. As far as we can see right now is BAU is around 17 to 17.5, and that's going to see that we can deploy the C-band, getting all the benefits we talked about. 4G is coming down. Fiber is more success-based. So, there's a lot of things happening in there, but we're really confident that we can be on those levels and our team is really doing a great job. Thank you, Craig. I'll start with the fixed wireless access question because I think that is an important one, and the lead, we will hear from Tony on that one. On the fixed wireless access, you are right. I mean, we are now running on a fairly high level, adding a broadband subscriber quota. Remember, we have defined, we are roughly in, I would say, a little bit over 70 of the PEAs of C-band so far out of 402. So, that, of course, is how many OFS are open for sales we can do right now. So, that is a little bit. The next step going to be the next tranche coming in. And I said, we're well ahead to the 4 million to 5 million. The team is doing a great job. You also saw that we now are doing some great work on how we can address MDUs in a very efficient way. We're in the beginning of that. So, all in all, I think that fixed wireless access and how we're managing our network is going great. And of course, as a ambitious leader as I am, I expect that we can do better, of course. But right now, that's the forecast we have to 4 million to 5 million, and we're really doing well. And this customer satisfaction on fixed wireless access is so good. It's so simple. You install it yourself, you get broadband immediately. So, we are just meeting a consumer demand that no one else is doing, basically. So, I'm really pleased with the product. We talked about this being one of the most important 5G applications, and now you can see what it means to us and how important it's going to be over time. So, on the first one, we have always a plan for network transformation that is continuously ongoing. That has not changed. When it comes to this lead sheathed cables discussion, I said, I mean, we are going to go through this scientific. We're going to do tests. We're going to do it fact-based, and then we'll come back. But we have a normal network transformation that we constantly do because Kyle and team are doing that in order to keep up with the pressure of the secular decline in wireline. So, he will continue to do that, and we do that all the time. On the second question on fixed wireless access, yes, of course, when we - the first 70-ish, I would say, C-band mark PAEs, that is called, they are mainly in urban areas. And that's where we have had that good traction on fixed wireless access. And the next step is going to be much more suburban and rural. And of course, that's great opportunities because usually there are even less different options for customers in those areas. So, of course, that's going to create opportunity for us. That doesn't mean that we're changing our guidance. We still say 4 million to 5 million by 2025. Of course, the team is always driving hard here, and I'm driving hard. We always want to achieve. We want to show our stakeholders that we're a great company and we execute well, which I think we're doing. So, definitely, we see opportunities to be coming with the next tranche of C-band. There were many questions in all there. So, let me start with the change of discounts that we did on fixed wireless access. Again, we have a premium product. We have different type of optionalities for our customers in order to pick and choose what the best tier is or what the best service is. So, we think that this is just natural when you have passed over 2 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. And I think - just think about when we started with Unlimited, you start with one plan, and then you start to work with different segmentation, because ultimately we are in a very, very big consumer business where so many differentiated customers that needs different type of services. So, just think about it as a very natural step for us in order to serve our customers in a good way. Then I hand it over to Tony for the next question. Yes. On the upgrade rates, as I said before, I mean, first of all, we at Verizon have been very disciplined in how to offer sort of products and services with the right price at the right time. So, definitely, that has been that we are actually doing less promos and less upgrades. That has not hampered our way of growing our business or taking customers. And we will continue to work with that. Then, of course, hasn't been any major product coming out in the market. We expect that it's going to be a product coming out in the second half. We are excited over that. And of course, that's going to drive upgrades and promos of course. But again, we will continue to be very financially disciplined. But of course, we're excited for these type of things as it attracts store traffic, and when traffic comes, we are really good. And having good conversion rates, adding things to it to our customers, which is really, really important. And second, on the fixed wireless access, taking away the discount, and again, we come to a level of 2.3 million fixed wireless access customer. There are so many different type of customers and consumers we have. So, of course, having different tiers and pricings becomes very normal in order to meet customer demands. So, it's just how we do, and that we'll continue to do and see how the market is developing. We can hear you, Walter. Yes, thank you. On the upgrade, I cannot - I don't know anything about any launch or the product, how exciting it's going to be, but ultimate, that usage usually drive more upgrades. So, let's see what's going to happen this time and when it comes out. But we're always excited to see Apple coming out with a new phone. Hopefully, they're coming in this one. I cannot reveal what they are doing, but clearly, we're excited for that. On the CapEx, yes, you should talk to us. We know more about this than other companies. I would say we have a really good sustainable level of this. Densification is part of our strategy already. So, and many of the things that we already are deploying on C-band, we deploy sort of for the full spectrum already from the beginning. Then we turn on when we get those tranches. So, there's a lot of things that my team has done over years in order to be as efficient as possible with CapEx. That's why I feel really good on our sort of BAU around 17 to 17.5. I feel really good about that because we go through the extremely detail. So, we feel confident."

            "name": "Tony Skiadas",
            "content": "Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the second quarter demonstrate our progress towards our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, delivering healthy consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and increasing free cash flow. Our focus on execution is working, and we remain on track to meet our financial guidance for 2023. We are happy with our progress, but we have more work to do. We are focused on continuing to improve our performance, while remaining financially disciplined. In the second quarter, our consumer segment demonstrated better operating results, both sequentially and year-over-year in postpaid phone net adds. Additionally, we experienced continued strong performance within our business segment, both in terms of mobility and FWA subscriber growth. The results reflect the benefits of our ongoing C-band deployment and improved go-to-market execution.  Consumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 136,000 for the quarter compared to 215,000 net losses in the second quarter of 2022. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds were strong once again, up 6.9% year-over-year, driven by new-to-Verizon gross adds, which increased approximately 19% over the prior year period. We also saw notable growth in consumer postpaid ARPA, which was up 6.2% year-over-year. The recent launch of myPlan reflects a more segmented and targeted approach. While it's still early, myPlan is driving a significantly higher premium mix, with nearly 70% of myPlan customers taking the Unlimited Plus option. We are also encouraged by the step activity we are seeing. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.76%, up one basis point compared with the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn drove the year-over-year increase, offsetting a modest improvement in voluntary churn. Our involuntary churn rates remain at pre-pandemic levels and were flat for the third consecutive quarter. It is important to note our performance in existing C-band markets. In the 46 markets where we initially deployed C-band, postpaid phone gross add growth was more than 100 basis points higher in the quarter than in non C-band markets. Additionally, phone churn was four basis points lower in C-band markets, and our premium mix in C-band markets was 11 percentage points higher.  Let's now look at our business results. Verizon Business once again delivered solid performance and continues to expand on its industry-leading wireless market share. Demand continues to be strong in all three customer groups, resulting in 144,000 phone net adds for the second quarter, compared to 227,000 for the same period last year, which benefited from some large deals. As Hans mentioned, this marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we have delivered over 125,000 business phone net adds. We continue to win high value business based on the strength of our network performance and value proposition. Notably, we had a recent government contract win where we took share from two of our competitors at attractive ARPUs. Moving on to broadband, we maintained our strong performance, with 418,000 total broadband net additions in the second quarter. In the past four quarters, we've added more than 1.6 million broadband subscribers, growing our total broadband subscriber base by more than 21% during that time. Growth in FWA remained healthy, with 384,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in the prior year period. We now have nearly 2.3 million customers on our FWA product, and we expect growth to continue at a fairly similar pace in the third quarter. On the Fios side, internet net adds for the second quarter were 54,000, up from 36,000 in the second quarter of last year. Despite continued softness in household move activity, gross adds rose year-over-year, and our retention levels continue to be strong. Our value market team continues to take steps to address some of the softness we saw in the first half of the year. Prepaid net losses totaled 304,000 in the second quarter. Our year-to-date net add performance should represent the low point as we continue to make progress integrating TracFone, while taking actions to better position us for growth, including scaling our Visible and Total by Verizon brands. As Hans mentioned, we expect to see sequential improvements beginning in the third quarter. Let's now look at our financials, starting with consolidated revenue for the quarter, which was $32.6 billion, down 3.5% year-over-year. The decline can be attributed to reduced wireless equipment revenue, which was nearly 21% lower than the prior year, as postpaid phone upgrade activity declined 34% versus the same period last year. Service and other revenue grew 0.8%, driven by wireless service revenue growth. Total wireless service revenue was $19.1 billion, up 3.8% year-over-year and more than $200 million sequentially. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from pricing actions, including a recent change to our Verizon Mobile Protect offering. Additionally, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, and growth in fixed wireless access, drove revenue improvements. These benefits were partially offset by continued pressure from the amortization of handset promotions. We are on track to deliver our wireless service revenue guidance for the year. We continue to assess opportunities to take targeted pricing actions to better monetize our products and services as we deliver great value for our customers. For example, we recently announced an increase in our FWA bundle pricing for new customers, which we expect will provide service revenue benefits in the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect less pressure from the amortization and promotional cost in the second half of the year, given the softer upgrade environment and our disciplined approach to promotional spending.  Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12 billion, up 0.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 160 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by lower consumer postpaid upgrade volumes, and improved service revenue. These benefits were partially offset by higher marketing expenses in the quarter related to the myPlan launch, as well as a $194 million increase in bad debt year-over-year. Bad debt was relatively flat from the prior quarter, and payment trends remained consistent with recent quarters and pre-pandemic levels.  Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items, were down 5.9% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volumes. As Hans mentioned, we continue to execute on our cost savings program, including through initiatives within our Verizon Global Services organization. During the quarter, we took actions to rationalize our workforce as we continue to see benefits from rationalizing certain legacy wireline products. We are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million of savings this year from our transformation efforts, and continue to make progress towards achieving our goal of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual cost savings by 2025.  Cashflow from operating activities for the second quarter was $9.7 billion, and for the first half of the year totaled $18 billion, compared to $17.7 billion in the prior year period. The increase continues to be related to working capital improvements associated with lower inventory levels and fewer upgrades, which were offset in part by higher cash income taxes and interest expense. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, which reflects the completion of our $10 billion accelerated C-Band program. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.1 billion, which was over $400 million less than last year. We continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. Our peak capital spend is behind us, and we are now at a business-as-usual run rate for CapEx, which we expect will continue into 2024.  The net result of cashflow from operations and capital spending is free cashflow for the quarter of $5.6 billion. Free cashflow for the first half of the year is $8 billion, a nearly $800 million improvement from the previous year, driven by a combination lower CapEx spend compared to the prior year, and operating cashflow benefits previously mentioned. While we do not normally guideline free cash flow, our strong results give us a clear line of sight to more than $17 billion of free cash flow for the full year.  Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.6 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the end of the previous quarter, and $4.1 billion lower year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash on hand. We are well positioned with respect to our unsecured debt maturities, with no remaining obligations for the rest of the year. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times as of the end of the second quarter, a 0.1 time improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to monitor the current interest rate environment closely given recent comments from the Federal Reserve on planned rate increases later in the year. As previously stated, we expect higher interest expense to impact our full year earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30, and there's no change to that view. Our strong second quarter results support our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged.  Before I hand the call back to Hans, I'd like to address the recent media reports on lead sheath cables in our network. Here is what we currently know. We still have some legacy lead sheath cable in our copper network. As a result of the age of this infrastructure and the history of the industry, records are incomplete as to exactly how much of the cable at our network has led sheathing. However, to give you a sense of the scale of the infrastructure we are talking about, our copper network is comprised of less than 540,000 miles of cable, roughly half of which is aerial, and lead sheath cable makes up a small percentage of our copper network. This number excludes the network elements previously owned by MCI and XO communications because we are still reviewing the historical records of those companies. When not disturbed, the likelihood of exposure to lead from lead sheath cables is low. In addition, because the lead sheath cable was used as a feeder and distribution cable and does not run into individual homes or apartments, it is generally in locations that minimize the potential for public contact. We are working with a third party expert to conduct our own testing at our sites that were identified by the media. We will not have the results of our testing for several weeks. When we have the results of our testing, we will work closely with our industry and others to address any concerns and issues.  Now, I think it's important to address a question we've received from a lot of investors, which is about the process for and potential cost of removal of the lead sheath cable in our network. Given where we are in this process, it is far too soon to make any projection on what the potential financial impact might be to the company. There are a number of unknowns in this area, including whether there is a health risk presented by undisturbed lead sheath cable, and if there is a risk, how that risk should be addressed. As a result, we do not believe there's a meaningful way to estimate any potential cost to the company or that any such estimate would even be useful. We won't be able to provide any additional color during the Q&A session. As we have more information we can share on the topic, we will certainly do that.  I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions. Yes, thanks, Hans. Good morning, John. So, on the service revenue, we're very confident in the guide. You mentioned tough comps that we face in the second half. When you think about the second half of the year, let me unpack some of the drivers for you. As you know, we executed a number of targeted pricing actions between the price ups on the Legacy Unlimited plans that we did earlier in the quarter, as well as most recently changes to our handset insurance program and price changes on FWA bundles. Secondly, we had the introduction of myPlan back in May. That's helped with premium mix and you heard that we're roughly 70% taking the Unlimited Plus plan. As Hans mentioned, we see an increase in contribution from fixed wireless access. We have 2.3 million subs in the base, and we have great momentum on FWA. And then fourth, we see continued improvements in year-over-year consumer postpaid volumes, and you saw that in the quarter. And then lastly, when you think about the promo amortization, the revenue impact from promotions and the promo amortization has decelerated in recent quarters, and that's - it's basically a function of our disciplined approach to promotions and retention. So, when you put that all together, we're very confident that all the initiatives here will continue to drive the meaningful revenue growth in the second half. Yes, and to add on to that, John, we're still reviewing the records, and we mentioned that we're still reviewing the historical records of the former MCI and XO network. So, that work is still ongoing as well. So, we still have more work to do there, and as we learn more, we'll keep you updated. Yes. Hi, Brett, it's Tony. So, volumes are important to the business, and as we said before, we're going to be very disciplined on how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. It's too soon to call third quarter positive for consumer. But as we said, we expect improvements year-over-year in consumer net adds. And the team and Sampath and the team are very focused on that. Okay, Simon. And then on your question on the cash generation here, we're very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which was very strong and reflective of our strong free cash flow results that is running higher than normal. As a reminder, we do have about $4.5 billion of the C-band clearing obligations remaining and due soon, and that's obviously a priority for us. The cash generation, as I said, is strong, gives us optionality and supports a much-improved dividend payout ratio. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We said first we would invest in the business. The second priority is our commitment to the dividend. Our third priority is to delever, and you'll see us be focused on that. And then once we get to the leverage metric of 2.25, we will consider buybacks at that time. Yes. Good morning, Phil. And then on the service revenue, as we mentioned upfront, we have some tough comps as we lap the price ups from last year. We do expect sequential improvements in the third quarter. One thing to note, just on the prepaid revenue, we did see a headwind in the quarter of about $125 million. I would expect that to be at a similar level in the third quarter before it eases up in the fourth quarter. That's probably one additional data point for you. Yes, the only thing I would add is that we have a great rhythm at 400,000 broadband net adds in the quarter. And again, the third consecutive quarter of over 400,000 broadband net adds. And we continue to see good momentum with customers taking - wireless customers taking FWA and we see great progress there as well. And then Craig, on the lead, as we said earlier, it's a small part of our network. It's about 50% aerial. We said we're still reviewing the historical records, both former MCI network and the former XO copper network. So, we still have work to do there. We're going to take a very methodical approach, very fact-based, very scientific-based approach. And as we know everyone wants more information, and as we learn more, we'll keep you updated. Yes. On the cable partnership. I mean, as Hans mentioned, we don't go into the details. I mean, we continue to see volume growth in the relationship. And we're very satisfied with the relationship, and we continue to monetize the network, as Hans said earlier. We continue to work across the company and continue to take a methodical approach. We're not going to get into any specifics around employees or anything, but as we said, we'll keep you posted as we learn more."

And the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. \nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; as well as our current Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis and Chief Financial Officer designate, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement which can be found on slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website a detailed review of our first quarter results. Please note that, during the first quarter in order to better serve our customers we reorganized the customer groups within our business segment. We now report the following customer groups: enterprise and public sector business markets and Software as a Service and wholesale. Prior period operating revenue results within the business segment have been recast to reflect these changes. You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call 2023. We delivered a solid first quarter marked by strong performance as we continue to execute on our plan to grow the business across mobility, broadband and private networks. We're making steady progress, and expect to keep up the momentum going forward. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue EBITDA and free cash flow. We grew total postpaid phone gross adds by 5% year-over-year this quarter and achieved 3% wireless service revenue growth $11.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA as well as a strong cash flow from operations of $8.3 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion versus the prior year. We're working everyday to move the business forward by using the power of America's most reliable network to deliver the best experience for our customers. During the quarter we reached more than 200 million POPs covered C-band in just over a year, since we lease up the first site. With access to that spectrum and advancing the build-out as quickly as we did we have enabled new source of revenue growth and elevated our customers' overall wireless experience. In the first quarter J.D. Power recognized us as the most awarded for network quality for the 30th time in a row. We're seeing improvements in already leading network performance validated by year-to-date root metrics testing and our customers are taking notice. Where we offer C-band, we see significant benefits in fixed wireless access consumer phone gross adds and retention, as well as premium take rates. We also see 4G customers benefiting as we offload traffic in some markets to our 5G Ultra Wideband network. The performance improvements will continue as 5G penetration expands market-by-market. We're excited about the remaining deployment of C-band spectrum and the potential dividend luck for both our business and consumer performance. Moving on to mobility. On the business side even in the current economic conditions by peers across different industries have combined confidence that mobility remains a priority in their spending. During the first quarter, Verizon business continued to run of strong performance, delivering 136,000 postpaid phone net adds. This was accomplished in spite of some pressures around restructurings within the technology sector. On the consumer side, payment trends are at healthy pre-COVID levels and consumers are shopping evidenced by our increase in consumer postpaid phone gross adds, which were up 11% year-over-year with the new to Verizon ads leading the way. Our gross ad performance is proof that our surgical and segmented approach to the market is working. We're in a much better position than a year ago, entering the second quarter with a sustained momentum around gross adds, as well as postpaid churn where we saw improved performance each month across the first quarter. We remain committed to our strategy not to compete on who can discount the most, but rather who can offer the most value to customers the best overall experience and the best customer satisfaction. +play is a great example of this. We listen to our consumers and introduce exciting partners like Peloton and Netflix, providing exclusive deals on an easy-to-use subscription managed platform and there is more to come. Our segmented approach to the market recognize that one plan doesn't not fit all and we have continued the work to address are underperforming segments. I've talked about our efforts to be more targeted and surgical with our retention. And we saw that play out during the quarter. By reducing upgrade volumes and lowering inefficient spending, we were able to deliver working capital benefits while finishing the quarter in a good place with churn and executing on migrations to premium unlimited. Those are real cash savings and a key driving to the large year-over-year improvements in free cash flow. You have seen us taking pricing action most recently on some of our legacy unlimited lands. We continue to look across our base and evaluate opportunities to more closely align pricing to our value proposition. On prepaid, we are working diligently to realize the full potential of this segment. While net ads were down by more than 207,000 versus the prior year this total was affected by two transitory factors. First, more than 100% of our net year-over-year decline came from higher disconnects within our SafeLink brand, which provides services to customers on government subsidized programs. We're still in the process of migrating customers onto our network as well. Prepaid is an important part of our value segment strategy and our investment here will continue as we're confident that will pay off in the long-term. Turning to broadband, which is a major growth area for us across consumer and business. We achieved the highest net adds in over 10 years, adding 437,000 total net adds within the quarter including 67,000 net adds from FiOS. We are very pleased with the FiOS performance with net adds up 12% year-over-year. For fixed wire access, we're seeing growth quarter-after-quarter of the quarter with 1.9 million subscribers at the end of the first quarter, fixed wireless continues to scale and contribute increasingly to our revenue performance. Our business customers are increasingly turning to fixed wireless access as the primary source of broadband connectivity, won over by the reliability and the overall value of the product. In addition to take any share from our competitors, we're also seeing new use cases across all of our customer groups, leveraging the flexibility of the product to expand beyond what traditional wired broadband can do. Finally, in private networks, our Verizon business team continues to execute at a high level. We announced new deals with KPMG and Deloitte and have a strong funnel of business ahead of us. We have also established a leadership position as a top network provider in the public sector. This quarter we announced a 15-year critical infrastructure contract with FAA, worth over $2 billion to design, build, and operate, and maintain the FAA's next-generation communication platform. This is in addition to many ongoing products we're working on for large federal agencies. In creating the networks that move the world forward, we remain committed to running our business responsibly for our customers, shareholders, employees, and society. Last month, we published our 2022 ESG report, which highlights how business, ethics, governance, environmental stewardship, and human rights are at the center of everything we do. I encourage you to take some time to review the report and learn about how we are managing risk and unlocking opportunities surrounding the issues of utmost importance for our stakeholders. Our commitments here come right from our leaders and their teams. A few weeks ago I announced new leadership for our two business units the network organization and our Chief Financial Officer. These leaders come with nearly 100 years of experiences within Verizon and bring a proven track record of successful execution. Let me take a moment to walk through these changes. Sampath takes over as a CEO of Verizon Consumer. His objectives are clear; to enhance our consumer operation model and experience, deepen our segmentation approach, scale fixed wireless access and broadband, and drive financial discipline. Kyle Malady was appointed CEO of Verizon Business. CIOs are increasingly searching for technology reach solutions and nobody knows our technology like Kyle. His focus is clear; drive sustainable growth in mobility and deliver on the revenue growth opportunities within fixed wireless, 5G private, wireless, and mobile edge compute solutions. Joe Russo takes over as a President of Global Networks and Technology to continue our efforts to extend, enhance, and solidify the nation's leading wireless network and vast global IP and fiber network. Finally, Matt Ellis leaves us at the end of the month on the 10 years at Verizon and six years as our CFO. I want to thank him for his many contributions to our business. Tony Skiadas assumed the title of Chief Financial Officer on May the 1st. I appreciate Tony's work to improve operations and drive performance as we search for a long-term CFO replacement. So, let's now move on and talking about efficiencies. The teams are on the way to deliver better, simpler, and more efficient end-to-end processes for our customers and employees. Spearheaded by the Verizon Global Services Group, we're looking into numerous areas across the business that will help drive bottom line growth including IT platform transformations, building advanced AI models for the better diagnostic and predictive insights, optimizing our real estate footprint and managing our supply chain efficiently. We have also reduced headcount over the last quarters. All-in-all, our cost efficiency program is on track to achieve our target of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual savings by 2025, which will help to fund our growth as well as drive margin improvements over time. With almost all our 10 billion C-band capital expenditure program behind us, we expect our cash generation profile to expand over the next few years, driven by revenue growth, cost management and efficiencies with capital expenditures. This helps support our objective to achieve consistent dividend growth with our 16 consecutive years of increases, currently the longest streak in the industry. As we look to build on the free cash flow growth generated in the first quarter, we expect to see significant improvement in our dividend payout ratio this year, putting the board in a strong position to increase the dividend once again and bring us closer to our debt targets over the following years. Going into the second quarter, I'm energized by the execution of the Verizon team and our new leadership across key positions. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow expansion. And with that I will now turn it over to Matt for the last time.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans. And good morning. Our results for the first quarter reflect the steps we have taken to improve our performance. C-band and the investments in our network are having a positive benefit on customer and overall network experiences. And as Hans mentioned, we are seeing a direct benefit around fixed wireless and phone gross adds among other metrics, where we operate C-band but more work remains to be done. Taking a look at operating results of the first quarter, let's start with consumer postpaid phones, which had $263,000 net losses for the quarter compared to $292,000 net losses for the prior year period. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds was strong across the quarter, up over 11% year-over-year continuing the momentum from the second half of last year. Our efforts around the segmentation of our base and our more targeted go-to-market approach and offerings to those different customer groups have been key drivers behind our improved gross add performance. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.84%, up 7 basis points compared to the same period last year. We are now seeing a return of involuntary churn rates to pre-pandemic levels. As for voluntary churn, performance was mixed across the quarter starting off elevated as we saw normal holiday season activity extend into the early parts of the first quarter. But as the quarter progressed, we saw improvements in terms of year-over-year churn performance, exit in the quarter with voluntary churn rates in line with last year. While we have more work to do to improve consumer net adds, we are encouraged by the double-digit percentage improvement in gross adds combined with the improved churn level at the end of the first quarter. We entered the second quarter with significantly better momentum than a year ago. Moving on to the business segment. Verizon business again delivered strong results. We saw solid demand across our three customer groups and had 136,000 phone net adds for the first quarter compared to 256,000 for the same period last year. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a couple of large deals that contributed to our net adds results a year ago. Additionally, we saw an increase in churn due to business customers being more cautious around spending and the restructurings Hans noted in his remarks. Moving along to broadband on a consolidated basis, we delivered 437,000 net additions in the first quarter, the most in a decade. As expected, we saw another quarter of sequential growth in fixed wireless with 393,000 net adds, up from 379,000 in the prior quarter. Customer satisfaction remains high as evidenced by NPS scores, as well as encouraging churn trends around the more tenured cohorts of customers. On the fire side, Internet net adds for the first quarter was 67,000, up from 60,000 in the first quarter of last year. Customers continue to be attracted to our high-quality broadband products, which is reflected in the year-over-year increase in FiOS gross adds even in an environment with lower move volumes versus the prior year. FiOS retention rates continue to be strong with our best churn performance in more than five years. While the first quarter results were prepaid were below our expectations, we remain confident in the value market opportunities and the benefits of having a portfolio of assets and plans to satisfy the needs of all of our customers. You heard from Hans some of the actions we are taking to create long-term value. As expected in the short-term these actions are having a negative impact on our prepaid net ads. Together with the elevated disconnects and our SafeLink brand that Hans referenced, we expect pressure on prepaid net adds to increase in the second quarter before they abate later in the year. Moving on to the financials. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $32.9 billion, down 1.9% year-over-year primarily due to equipment revenue being lower by 9% as well as continued declines in business wireline services. Wireless service revenue was $18.9 billion, up 3.0% year-over-year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, results for the first quarter included a benefit of approximately 185 basis points associated with the large allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue. This benefit was partially offset by the impact associated with the shutdown of our 3G network completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The shutdown resulted in the removal of approximately 1.1 million retail connections and the corresponding loss of revenue for the first quarter and beyond. We continue to see pressure on service revenue from the cost of promotions and the amortization impact in the first quarter. Additionally, we see pressure from prepaid revenue as a result of lower subscribers versus prior year. To help offset these pressures, we've recently implemented additional pricing actions across our business and consumer segments. We expect to see the benefits of these actions ramp across the second quarter as the business segment began billing customers closer to the end of the first quarter, while consumers started earlier this month. As a result of these combined pricing actions, we anticipate approximately $75 million of incremental quarterly revenue moving forward. Additionally, the consumer team is working to improve efficiencies around device promotions and credits that we expect to yield revenue benefits across the remainder of the year. We believe that the actions the teams are taking will grow the top line driving both EBITDA and cash flow. To complement this, the team expects to make additional progress across 2023 on the development and implementation of cost efficiency initiatives resulting in a meaningful savings run rate at the end of the year. During the first quarter, operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were down 2.4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volume which helped to offset an increase in bad debt of approximately $200 million. Similar to involuntary churn rates, bad debt expense reflects the return of collections to pre-pandemic levels. While up year-over-year, bad debt expense is relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter totaled $8.3 billion, compared to $6.8 billion in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to working capital improvements, driven by lower inventory levels, coupled with fewer upgrades and a modest improvement in customer payment patterns, despite the current macroeconomic conditions. CapEx for the quarter came in at $6.0 billion, which includes most of the remaining $1.75 billion of C-band-related spending in our guidance. With the conclusion of the program, we would expect a step down in the pacing of overall CapEx throughout the remainder of the year and continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion versus last year. Total unsecured debt for the quarter was $132.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion compared to the end of 2022 and $5.3 billion lower year-over-year. This resulted in net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times as of the end of the first quarter. A 0.1 times improvement compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat from the prior quarter. We continue to have very low near-term unsecured debt maturities with the only maturity remaining in 2023 and being approximately $600 million due in the second quarter. I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be my last earnings call as Verizon's CFO. It has been a fulfilling 10 years at Verizon and a privilege to serve as CFO and I'm thankful to everyone that has made it such a rewarding experience. From our talented finance team to my fellow executive team members to all of you that have had the pleasure of getting to know, I want to say thank you. Verizon is in good hands with Tony as its CFO. I've worked closely with him since my first day at the company and I know he will always strive to drive the business forward in a way that puts Verizon and its shareholders first. I truly look forward to seeing what he and the entire Verizon team will achieve, as I chair them on from the sidelines, as an enthusiastic customer and shareholder. With that, I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments, before we open up to your questions. \nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Matt. In summary, our disciplined approach has led to significant progress on our key strategic plans and we need to keep the momentum and focus going. We're pleased with how 2023 has started. We continue to deliver the best customer experience on the most reliable network supported by the best people in the industry. In mobility, our segmented and surgical approach to the market is working and we are taking pricing actions where possible. In broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning, as we continue to capture market share. We'll continue to grow our cash generation profile and maximum shareholder returns, aided by our cost efficiency program and lowered capital expenditures. I remain confident in our strategy and our strong focus on execution. We are always identifying new ways to evolve our business and execute on opportunities. In everything we do, we focus on driving profitable growth. We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders for our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Brady over for the questions.\nBrady Connor : Thanks Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions this morning. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question for today comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Good morning guys. And Matt thanks for all the help over the years and best of luck to you in the future. If I could just start with a couple of wireless questions. First on the gross side of the consumer side, obviously, some strength there. Any other detail you can give us in terms of what's driving the double-digit improvement. I think AT&T saw a decline. It just any change in the promotional posture or anything you're doing there? And then on the other side of the ledger churn, obviously, up a little bit year-over-year but it sounds like you're making some trends. Did you guys make any pricing changes on the consumer side in the first quarter? And just -- any comments around the sustainability of those improvements as we look forward throughout the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. Let me start and then I'll hand it over to Matt. I think what we saw in the first quarter was very much the momentum. We start building I would say end of the third and into the fourth when it comes to both how we converted our customers to be part of our journey with the more segmented approach. And that we have seen through the quarter when it comes to our gross ads that many of the initiatives we have had all the way from the welcome plan and many of the others they have been working well for us that partly is what we have been doing. And then, of course, I think we're much more focused. And, of course, now with the new team in place as well where we have full alignment with Sampath when it comes to the execution here and seeing that we're getting the right customers in. I think that has been helpful as well. Then as you have seen we're coming in and out of the quarter with promotions. We really are taking the opportunity when we see that we have an opportunity to bring in customers. So that's how are you seeing the momentum continue. And as Matt said also in his opening here, we have seen that momentum continuing for us. And for the churn, I will hand it over to Matt. But as I said I mean we had a little bit higher in the beginning of the quarter and it continued to improve. And we\u2019re working with both that as well as we continue to create the momentum we have right now on the consumer wireless. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Thanks Hans. Good morning John. So on the churn side; certainly we saw improvement as the quarter went on. We had a lot of carryover from holiday level churn in January by the time we got to March we saw a much better momentum there. So that's the jump-off point as we go into second quarter. The pricing changes that you mentioned in your question really didn't go into effect until we came to the moving from Q1 to Q2, so that will be incremental to the results of the business here as we get into the rest of the year. So -- but as Hans said really a case of rebuilding from the momentum last year that was a year ago was not where we wanted it to be. At the midpoint of the year, we talked about taking actions and you see the results of those actions showing up in the results. And so the team is focused on continuing to build from there.\nJohn Hodulik: Perfect. Great. Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks John. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I'd also like to reiterate my thanks to Matt for all his help over the years. My question is about fixed wireless. So when I look at the formal remarks document you put out, it looks like you still have just over 40 million households where that can get your fixed wireless service. The reason I bring it up is that would appear to be a fraction of the availability of your ultra-wideband network, which now covers over two-thirds of the population. So, I was wondering, how do we think about the game plan for expanding the distribution of the fixed wireless service now that you have significantly expanded the ultrabroadband -- ultra-wideband network? And how do we think about the cadence of quarterly fixed wireless and agent here? Is there still going to be a tailwind, or are we getting to a point where it's leveling now? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brett. First of all, we're really pleased with the performance on the fixed wireless access. The team is doing a great work. And remember, it's not only the consumer side, it's the business side as well. On the business side, many new use cases are coming up on using fixed wireless access. So, the team are scaling and we're on scale right now. So, like the rhythm, I see on our sales motions right now and if you see in the first quarter, almost 400000. When it comes to the network, you know that later -- the latter part of this year in December actually -- or we will get our next chunk of C-band. Right now, we're covering some 70 markets out of over 400. It's 330 markets left, we will get the C-band. And we clearly pointed out in the opening here that, we opened a C-band. We're not only seeing fixed-wireless access opportunity. We also see step-ups and a greater upgrade cycle for our customers because they see the improvements on the C-band. So we're very encouraged by the C-band coming out. But as I said, we're waiting for the clearance by the year-end to get even more. But as we roll out, right now, we open up markets. And remember, we talked about that we are in the network team, we're now decentralizing, so we can attack locally, because we are sort of opening markets locally. The same goes what Sampath is working on right now is also taking his operations more locally, so we can both the marketing and execution locally. And you might have seen it that we do more local things, because as we open up more on fixed wireless access, we do that locally. And so far our success rate is high. We're just going to go do this in the right way to take the learnings with us doing better all the time. We also have started with differentiation on different type of peers when it comes to our fixed wireless offerings. There's a lot more to be done there. But as I said, I'm very pleased with the rhythm and the market share we're taking and remember, the C-band so far is deployed mainly in urban and suburban areas, where the majority of the spectrum coming is actually in more of the suburban and rural. And we also get of course more urban spectrum as we're only deploying 60, maybe 80-some megahertz, 100 where we are in average 160. So, I have to say, this is one of the biggest 5G used cases we have right now and we really see good traction. So that's how we're going forward. \nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Brett. Brad, ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you, very much. Good morning and again my best wishes to Matt for the future. Just following up on Brett's fixed wireless question, you talked about scaling. It looks like you're almost hitting two million fixed wireless subscribers now. How is it working on the network capacity side of things? And what's your confidence in going to continue to handle increasing usage from the customers as this continues to scale? And then, if we could just go back to the announcement, I think it was March 3 of the new appointments. You talked a little bit about Kyle and Sampath. But what if we were inside Verizon, what are the big changes that have taken place over the past seven weeks or so that are really changing the trajectory particularly of consumer. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Simon. On the capacity, the guys is great. First of all were used on an initial trends of spectrum that we're using as I said, we were fixed wireless access on the ultra-wideband. We have so much more capacity coming. On top of that, all the new features you have with advanced 5G carrier action we have new devices coming out that can handle different spectrum. So there are so many more things, I feel really confident that, we will manage this capacity without any problems to the levels we have talked about and way beyond that. Then of course, as I talked with many of you guys, if it comes a moment that we have a community that have a lot of fixed will have over time other opportunities of sales splitting, et cetera. We are not even close to that today. So, I feel really good about, how the guys are managing the network and the opportunities we're building on our C-band here. As I said on the 4G fixed price actions, they were more opportunistic and selling when we see that we have capacity, but not sort of where we see that we have that full. We're not selling any more. But this expansion is right now on 5G Ultra Wideband. When it comes to the new team the big changes I've seen first of all, the first big change is that these guys are operational day one. I mean, both Kyle and Sampath straight into. If you look at Sampath, he's very much focused both on the customer dimension and seeing that we were improving the momentum we have right now on gross ads and churn and see that we actually improving through the year. But it also works with our offerings and our operations see that we're even stronger locally. Kyle on the other hand continuing the work of Sampath great momentum on Business Wireless as we continue this quarter private networks is really taking off. And then on top of that working with a wireline decline to see that we're taking out cost at the same time managing our contract and I don't think there's no one better than Kyle. He knows the network that more than anybody else. So I think that's the main focus and they've been really fast. And then of course the transitions between Tony and Matt is going extremely simple because these guys have worked together for 10 years. Tony is already into all the operations working very closely with the new leaders all the way from Joe that's running networking Kyle and Sampath. So I feel good. I feel really good and confident about it and it's very clear that the priorities there. So maybe, Tony you can say something about your priorities. \nTony Skiadas: Sure. Thanks, Hans, and good morning, Simon. I'm excited to have the opportunity to succeed Matt as the CFO. In terms of my priorities, I have three of them. First supporting our new leaders Sampath, Kyle and Joe in executing their strategies. And that includes narrowing our focus with a very strong emphasis on operational performance; second, ensuring that we deliver the 2023 financial guidance that we laid out in January; and third, ensuring that we continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy the four capital allocation priorities that we shared with you last year those remain unchanged. So those are my three priorities right out of the gate. And as Hans mentioned, the transition has gone exceptionally well. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much, and good luck.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks Simon. Brad, ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick: Hi. Thanks very much. Two if I can. First, can you expand on the bad debt and churn discussion and how that relates to the upgrades which seem to be fading through the quarter? And then second, if you can talk about prepaid. Are the losses mostly happening in SafeLink and what is happening in this and the different brands and any conversion of prepaid to postpaid this quarter? And how would you report that if it was happening? Thanks very much.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. That was a lot of questions in one. I will start on the high level here on the \u2013 as we said earlier, the payment patterns are basically same as pre \u2013 we have a high-quality customer base. We see this is very healthy at the moment all the way. I will ask Matt to expand on that because looking backwards. And then when it comes to the question on prepaid or value segment yes, as we said in an opening here, I mean the negative number is I would say 100% coming from SafeLink, which is a government-subsidized brand. But there are other puts and takes there as well. I think that the visible brand is doing well. We're just ramping up total wireless which is an important piece of it not having all the things coming through there. So \u2013 and then of course we have the network migration still happening. So it's combination of a lot of things on the different brands. Our confidence is that we will improve that at the latter part of the year when some of these things are moving out. So that's a general comment maybe on the churn piece Matt, if you say something.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So, thanks, Phil. So looking at the churn and the bad debt and to your question was more around the bad debt side. So certainly up a little bit year-over-year but more importantly flat sequentially. And what you're really seeing is first quarter last year we still had some impacts in there of some of the COVID-related activities. That's now fully out. And I'd say we're back to [indiscernible] run rate. In terms of the \u2013 with the lower upgrades in there, also the plus 11% phone growth adds, Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks a lot of those growth adds were new to Verizon. And those new to Verizon customers typically come in at a different bad debt accrual rate than upgrades which is existing customers that we know well and so that's the trade-off there. The other thing I look at on the bad debt side. One, you see from our most recent ABS filings at our FICO scores across our base continues to be very strong. We've talked for many years now about the quality of the Verizon postpaid base and you see that there. And then secondly, the payment patterns we actually had from customers this quarter actually just slightly better sequentially in terms of the aging. So we're seeing good behavior, good payment activity from our customer base, which is why you see the flat bad debt on a sequential basis now that we're fully through the COVID period.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks. If I can just follow-up, was there any conversion from prepaid to postpaid, or I may have missed it?\nMatt Ellis: A little bit but nothing material, but that's obviously, certainly something the team is very focused on going forward having that opportunity in the got that's still ahead of them to be a much more meaningful contributor going forward.\nPhil Cusick: Great. Thanks, again, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all the help, Matt. I guess in the prepared remarks Matt, I think you mentioned that there were going to be some cost efficiency benefits in 2023. I was wondering if you could kind of -- in that $2 billion to $3 billion target talk about the cadence of how you see that unfolding in maybe the second half of this year and into the coming years? And then the second question would be one of the things that's contributed to, I think, the momentum that you guys have been talking about a lot on the call has been a combination of the new kind of more affordable welcome and limited plan and a lot of the marketing you've been doing. Could you talk about what the new kind of management team want to do to take that maybe to another level if at all this year and kind of what the end goal is flat subscribers to goal, or is market share of the goal? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I will start and then I will toss the question on cost to Tony, and I will start with your second question. So the team, I think, we just need to divide the wireless question that you have. On the business side, I think, it's clear we're really strong. We are taking market share. The team is working through SMB government and large enterprises with our offerings where the network is the key contributor. Kyle will continue that work and the drumbeat we have there. On the consumer side, I think, that Sampath and I are 100% the line that we are in a momentum where we are now going to continue to improve our net additions on consumer, but most importantly is to grow in the service revenue. But of course, we want customers as well. But mostly important is growing the service revenue and expanding the cash flow and EBITDA. That's really the main focus for Sampath that were 100% the line on. But that also means that we need to take customers. And I think that we will continue to evolve our proposition and coming with new products. So I feel encouraged what I've seen so far and the thinking that Sampath and the team have, but we need to stay tuned for some of the new things coming, Tony? \nTony Skiadas: Thanks Hans. David, good morning. So, on the cost side as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're making progress with Verizon Global Services and all the cost transformation efforts. As we mentioned previously, we're on track with our cost efficiency program to take $2 billion to $3 billion of cost out by 2025. Within that, we'll see some of those benefits manifest themselves in the second half of this year in 2023 with significant savings in 2024 and really focused on areas like sourcing transformation IT conversions and transformations as well as supply chain and other AI models. \nDavid Barden: Yes. Good. Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. And Matt I also want to express my thanks and best wishes as you leave Verizon. If I could focus on two topics. First on the ARPU side if you can unpack a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing on the unlimited and premium unlimited take rates and where those can go over time in terms of continuing to monetize the network and the bundles that you offer? And then on the lower upgrade rate, are you seeing a fundamental change in customer holding periods for devices and what does that mean for the size of the switcher pool in the industry going forward? \nHans Vestberg: I can start. I mean we -- I can on a high level say, we continue to see the trend from our customer on postpaid going to unlimited and then go to unlimited premium. That continues to team is doing great work to see that we're doing that transition. And -- but we still have opportunities. We still have customer meter plans. We still have a portion or One Unlimited can go to unlimited premium. So we still see that as an important growth trajectory for our ARPU going forward. And then on the upgrades, I mean, we have talked about before, I mean, the market indication is that, it's going to be a little bit smaller switcher pool. That doesn't mean that we feel that we shouldn't be taking more fair share. We should definitely do that and continue to see that our customers that we have, we're expanding with them and then we're actually bringing new customers. So, I think, that's what we see right now. But, again, we have good momentum with all the offerings we have. I expect my consumer team come out with new offerings as well. So -- and continue that drum beat. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. No, exactly, Hans. And, Mike, good morning. So as you think about it, the strategy is one always to get the customer in, then have the opportunity to move customers up the stack and you see we've done that number of different ways over the years and you should expect us to continue to find ways to do that. And then, also, we get the opportunity to add other things to the account, so fixed wireless access allows us to increase ARPU and adding other devices to the accounts too. So there's still significant opportunities there for us to grow share of wallet with the customer as we go forward. And I would expect that the consumer team will continue to make sure that they are having the right pricing constructs and offerings in front of customers and those will constantly evolve over time, so that we can continue to grow ARPU.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. And if I could just throw one other out there. Just from a government program perspective, can you share how Verizon participates in ACP? And any new thoughts on potentially participating in the BEAD program?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. So I'll take the first shot. Look, ACP is an important program. As you've seen, the actions we've taken over the past few years, whether it's the acquisition of TracFone, the introduction of plans like Welcome. We want to participate in all customer segments. That includes ACP, whether that be on the wireless side or the fixed side. So we do participate in those programs. And then, as the BEAD programs come out, we will look for where it makes the most sense for us to participate in those programs. We've been doing -- we've been building fiber out to homes for a long time. We continue to do so. Over 500,000 new OFS last year, we said we'd do something in that same region again this year and into the foreseeable future at that type of run rate. So as that -- those new programs help us the opportunities to continue to do that, we'll certainly be very interested in looking at using them where it makes sense.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Great. Thanks Mike. Brad, go ahead for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open, sir.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. I want to sort of step back to a more strategic question about the wireless business if I could. I mean, for years your business model and your -- and sort of the way you came to market was based on a very low churn strategy, therefore, arguably you didn't need the same number of gross ads to sustain growth. And it was based on a very clear value proposition of best network. It seems like all of those pieces are quite different now. And despite what you said about the prospects for churn, churn is quite a bit higher for retention. How do you kind of win the battle for the hearts and minds, particularly in the consumer segment, by sort of returning to the base of convincing customers that yours is really the best network and sort of how do you win with the value proposition?\nHans Vestberg: I will start here. First of all, what we see right now is we have a clear value proposition when we roll out the C-band. We have great, great uptake step-ups from our customers when they see the C-band. And you know better than anybody else how much of that spectrum we have right now, which is a very little bit. And with all that we get this momentum that's why I feel so good about it. And then as Matt said our churn a little bit elevated, but it's also improving in the quarter. So, we're working on that. And having a gross the gross add momentum at the same time. That tells you something about where we're going right now heading. And then we have Sampath in the role that really know operational execution. So, I think we have all that and we have the best network clearly and it's just going to get better. I mean with every measurement we do right now, we are clearly come out as number one. And the only thing I know for sure, we're going to extend that leadership with the C-band continue to roll out. So, our proposition is very clear continue to have the best network have a good proposition for our customer because you need to continue to do new offerings to the consumer group because their behaviors are changing as well. That's why we came with it +play. We're listening to customers to make it easier and all of that. And you haven't seen the loss from us. So, I think that we're building on all the strength we have and those strengths are even getting stronger. \nBrady Connor: Thanks Craig. Yes, Brad, we're ready for next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTim Horan: Thanks guys. Can you be a little clearer on the network upgrades, it looks like you're more than doubling the amount of spectrum by year-end. What does that mean for coverage do you think in capacity? And when will we get to 300 million homes passed and more like 70 million or 80 million that have the ability to get fixed wireless? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: So, on the network you're absolutely right. We have on the C-band where you started to roll it out in the majority of the 60, 70 markets we're rolling out right now, we're using 60 megahertz. And you know we have an average 160 megahertz and in many places even up to 200 megahertz. So, it's an enormous difference when it comes from 60 to 160 megahertz, how much more capacity there is and on top of that of course we are adding new type of software features like carrier gauge [ph], the chip is getting better in devices both the handset and the fixed wire access devices. So, that's going to enhance the capacity for us. And as I said we were very focused to see that we materialize our business cases for the C-band all the way from consumer and business wireless to fixed wire access and mobile edge compute and private networks. So, we focus on the revenue generation of it and we'll continue to do so. But clearly it's going to be a step-up when we get the next tranche. And we're going to open more homes for households penetrated with fixed-line access and we're going to have much more markets covered by the C-band. So, we're just going to continue that journey as fast as we can.\nTim Horan: But does the increase section help the coverage, or do you still have to build out in those areas?\nHans Vestberg: I would say as we said from the beginning which many people doubted, we can use our existing 4G grid for the C-band. There is -- we don't need any new. However, we always build some new sites. We find new areas where there have been capacity constrained. We'll continue to do that as well. But mainly our C-band is using the 4G grid in order to see that the coverage is coming out there. And this year we're going to build a little bit more sizeable [ph] than we've normally done and the -- and our 4G spectrum, AWS and et cetera is covering 300 million pops a day. And that's where we be large band right now.\nTim Horan: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Great Tim. Thanks. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Hans, strategically you face a few choices, which I think are contradictory in some way and there is an attempt to grow gross adds, obviously, but SG&A is growing faster than revenues and so that puts pressure on margins. And it also comes with cash flow trade-offs. And we are trying to increase price to offset this margin impact but that comes with churn trade-offs. So ultimately when you think about your growth model or the growth have to double, what's the north star, is it unit growth? And are you willing to sacrifice margins and cash flow to get to that turnaround point, or is it margins? Even if it comes at the expense of unit growth, because it does feel like there is a choice that has to be made at some point. And I'm just wondering what the metric is that you're most focused on? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I think it's crystal clear. Our metrics that we're measured on is the service revenue and the EBITDA and cash flow expansion. You still need to have customers for that and you need to grow that. But ultimately that's what we measure ourselves on to see that we can grow that. And that's what you have seen from us right now. And you see the cash flow in the quarter. We are very focused on that. We think that's very important for all the stakeholders. And so then, of course, units are important but it's even more important to see that we have the right growth metrics when it comes to the company's finance. But maybe Tony wants to add something here.\nTony Skiadas: To just add on to what Hans mentioned. I mean, we have to be disciplined and segmented in how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. So the team is laser focused on that.\nBrady Connor: Good. Thanks, Kannan. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nPeter Supino: Hi, thanks. Question back to fixed wireless. Obviously, the expansion to suburban and rural markets is a big opportunity back in the urban areas where your C-band depth is going to more than double in 2023. Is there any reason that expansion shouldn't support accelerated marketing and approval of inbounds about FWA so that you would drive up your net ads in those markets as well?\nHans Vestberg: That's clear. I mean and that's why our organization both on the consumer side and the business side and our network side it's more regional right now, because we're following the deployment of the network and doing marketing and outreach to our customers on fixed virus access that really want to have it when we open up. So clearly you're right there is also opportunity in the urban places where we get more capacity or more coverage and as it goes for the suburban and the rural.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks Peter. Brad, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Can you -- with the business changes, can you walk us through on the SaaS line? What is SaaS revenue in total and where can you see growth there? And then back to the phone adds with the new level of gross adds you're getting, are there any characteristics about this type of customer you're tracking now that might be different than say two years ago and what their long-term churn characteristics might be?\nHans Vestberg: You need to repeat the first question. You're talking about SaaS revenues?\nFrank Louthan: Well with the breakout \u2013 you break out on the business line item. Just curious how much of that line that includes SaaS is. Is SaaS revenue and what is that growing? \nHans Vestberg: Yes. We don't disclose the SaaS revenue specifically. So yes.\nMatt Ellis: But overall, I mean it's not the largest part of that customer group you should be a fair assumption from.\nBrady Connor: Okay. And then what was the second part of the question, Frank? \nFrank Louthan: So with the gross adds that you're getting, are there any characteristics about these customers you're tracking that are maybe different from what they were say two years ago. And I'm curious about what you think about the long-term churn characteristics of customers you're tracking today, particularly given the heavier promotional activity that you've done versus what you did historically? \nHans Vestberg: In general, I think the churn characteristics all the new customers coming in is even better than before for many reasons as you said yourself. And then the type of customers I think Matt talked a little bit on the type of gross adds we're getting is new customers to Verizon, where they come in. And of course, we have opportunities to upgrade them, step up them and also having opportunities for our converged offerings. So really good quality of the customers coming in as Matt said, as well. So we feel really good about the growth momentum we have and the customers we are getting.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Frank. Brad that's all the time we have today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Hans, and good morning, Simon. I'm excited to have the opportunity to succeed Matt as the CFO. In terms of my priorities, I have three of them. First supporting our new leaders Sampath, Kyle and Joe in executing their strategies. And that includes narrowing our focus with a very strong emphasis on operational performance; second, ensuring that we deliver the 2023 financial guidance that we laid out in January; and third, ensuring that we continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy the four capital allocation priorities that we shared with you last year those remain unchanged. So those are my three priorities right out of the gate. And as Hans mentioned, the transition has gone exceptionally well. Thanks Hans. David, good morning. So, on the cost side as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're making progress with Verizon Global Services and all the cost transformation efforts. As we mentioned previously, we're on track with our cost efficiency program to take $2 billion to $3 billion of cost out by 2025. Within that, we'll see some of those benefits manifest themselves in the second half of this year in 2023 with significant savings in 2024 and really focused on areas like sourcing transformation IT conversions and transformations as well as supply chain and other AI models. To just add on to what Hans mentioned. I mean, we have to be disciplined and segmented in how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. So the team is laser focused on that."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call 2023. We delivered a solid first quarter marked by strong performance as we continue to execute on our plan to grow the business across mobility, broadband and private networks. We're making steady progress, and expect to keep up the momentum going forward. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue EBITDA and free cash flow. We grew total postpaid phone gross adds by 5% year-over-year this quarter and achieved 3% wireless service revenue growth $11.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA as well as a strong cash flow from operations of $8.3 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion versus the prior year. We're working everyday to move the business forward by using the power of America's most reliable network to deliver the best experience for our customers. During the quarter we reached more than 200 million POPs covered C-band in just over a year, since we lease up the first site. With access to that spectrum and advancing the build-out as quickly as we did we have enabled new source of revenue growth and elevated our customers' overall wireless experience. In the first quarter J.D. Power recognized us as the most awarded for network quality for the 30th time in a row. We're seeing improvements in already leading network performance validated by year-to-date root metrics testing and our customers are taking notice. Where we offer C-band, we see significant benefits in fixed wireless access consumer phone gross adds and retention, as well as premium take rates. We also see 4G customers benefiting as we offload traffic in some markets to our 5G Ultra Wideband network. The performance improvements will continue as 5G penetration expands market-by-market. We're excited about the remaining deployment of C-band spectrum and the potential dividend luck for both our business and consumer performance. Moving on to mobility. On the business side even in the current economic conditions by peers across different industries have combined confidence that mobility remains a priority in their spending. During the first quarter, Verizon business continued to run of strong performance, delivering 136,000 postpaid phone net adds. This was accomplished in spite of some pressures around restructurings within the technology sector. On the consumer side, payment trends are at healthy pre-COVID levels and consumers are shopping evidenced by our increase in consumer postpaid phone gross adds, which were up 11% year-over-year with the new to Verizon ads leading the way. Our gross ad performance is proof that our surgical and segmented approach to the market is working. We're in a much better position than a year ago, entering the second quarter with a sustained momentum around gross adds, as well as postpaid churn where we saw improved performance each month across the first quarter. We remain committed to our strategy not to compete on who can discount the most, but rather who can offer the most value to customers the best overall experience and the best customer satisfaction. +play is a great example of this. We listen to our consumers and introduce exciting partners like Peloton and Netflix, providing exclusive deals on an easy-to-use subscription managed platform and there is more to come. Our segmented approach to the market recognize that one plan doesn't not fit all and we have continued the work to address are underperforming segments. I've talked about our efforts to be more targeted and surgical with our retention. And we saw that play out during the quarter. By reducing upgrade volumes and lowering inefficient spending, we were able to deliver working capital benefits while finishing the quarter in a good place with churn and executing on migrations to premium unlimited. Those are real cash savings and a key driving to the large year-over-year improvements in free cash flow. You have seen us taking pricing action most recently on some of our legacy unlimited lands. We continue to look across our base and evaluate opportunities to more closely align pricing to our value proposition. On prepaid, we are working diligently to realize the full potential of this segment. While net ads were down by more than 207,000 versus the prior year this total was affected by two transitory factors. First, more than 100% of our net year-over-year decline came from higher disconnects within our SafeLink brand, which provides services to customers on government subsidized programs. We're still in the process of migrating customers onto our network as well. Prepaid is an important part of our value segment strategy and our investment here will continue as we're confident that will pay off in the long-term. Turning to broadband, which is a major growth area for us across consumer and business. We achieved the highest net adds in over 10 years, adding 437,000 total net adds within the quarter including 67,000 net adds from FiOS. We are very pleased with the FiOS performance with net adds up 12% year-over-year. For fixed wire access, we're seeing growth quarter-after-quarter of the quarter with 1.9 million subscribers at the end of the first quarter, fixed wireless continues to scale and contribute increasingly to our revenue performance. Our business customers are increasingly turning to fixed wireless access as the primary source of broadband connectivity, won over by the reliability and the overall value of the product. In addition to take any share from our competitors, we're also seeing new use cases across all of our customer groups, leveraging the flexibility of the product to expand beyond what traditional wired broadband can do. Finally, in private networks, our Verizon business team continues to execute at a high level. We announced new deals with KPMG and Deloitte and have a strong funnel of business ahead of us. We have also established a leadership position as a top network provider in the public sector. This quarter we announced a 15-year critical infrastructure contract with FAA, worth over $2 billion to design, build, and operate, and maintain the FAA's next-generation communication platform. This is in addition to many ongoing products we're working on for large federal agencies. In creating the networks that move the world forward, we remain committed to running our business responsibly for our customers, shareholders, employees, and society. Last month, we published our 2022 ESG report, which highlights how business, ethics, governance, environmental stewardship, and human rights are at the center of everything we do. I encourage you to take some time to review the report and learn about how we are managing risk and unlocking opportunities surrounding the issues of utmost importance for our stakeholders. Our commitments here come right from our leaders and their teams. A few weeks ago I announced new leadership for our two business units the network organization and our Chief Financial Officer. These leaders come with nearly 100 years of experiences within Verizon and bring a proven track record of successful execution. Let me take a moment to walk through these changes. Sampath takes over as a CEO of Verizon Consumer. His objectives are clear; to enhance our consumer operation model and experience, deepen our segmentation approach, scale fixed wireless access and broadband, and drive financial discipline. Kyle Malady was appointed CEO of Verizon Business. CIOs are increasingly searching for technology reach solutions and nobody knows our technology like Kyle. His focus is clear; drive sustainable growth in mobility and deliver on the revenue growth opportunities within fixed wireless, 5G private, wireless, and mobile edge compute solutions. Joe Russo takes over as a President of Global Networks and Technology to continue our efforts to extend, enhance, and solidify the nation's leading wireless network and vast global IP and fiber network. Finally, Matt Ellis leaves us at the end of the month on the 10 years at Verizon and six years as our CFO. I want to thank him for his many contributions to our business. Tony Skiadas assumed the title of Chief Financial Officer on May the 1st. I appreciate Tony's work to improve operations and drive performance as we search for a long-term CFO replacement. So, let's now move on and talking about efficiencies. The teams are on the way to deliver better, simpler, and more efficient end-to-end processes for our customers and employees. Spearheaded by the Verizon Global Services Group, we're looking into numerous areas across the business that will help drive bottom line growth including IT platform transformations, building advanced AI models for the better diagnostic and predictive insights, optimizing our real estate footprint and managing our supply chain efficiently. We have also reduced headcount over the last quarters. All-in-all, our cost efficiency program is on track to achieve our target of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual savings by 2025, which will help to fund our growth as well as drive margin improvements over time. With almost all our 10 billion C-band capital expenditure program behind us, we expect our cash generation profile to expand over the next few years, driven by revenue growth, cost management and efficiencies with capital expenditures. This helps support our objective to achieve consistent dividend growth with our 16 consecutive years of increases, currently the longest streak in the industry. As we look to build on the free cash flow growth generated in the first quarter, we expect to see significant improvement in our dividend payout ratio this year, putting the board in a strong position to increase the dividend once again and bring us closer to our debt targets over the following years. Going into the second quarter, I'm energized by the execution of the Verizon team and our new leadership across key positions. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow expansion. And with that I will now turn it over to Matt for the last time. Thanks, Matt. In summary, our disciplined approach has led to significant progress on our key strategic plans and we need to keep the momentum and focus going. We're pleased with how 2023 has started. We continue to deliver the best customer experience on the most reliable network supported by the best people in the industry. In mobility, our segmented and surgical approach to the market is working and we are taking pricing actions where possible. In broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning, as we continue to capture market share. We'll continue to grow our cash generation profile and maximum shareholder returns, aided by our cost efficiency program and lowered capital expenditures. I remain confident in our strategy and our strong focus on execution. We are always identifying new ways to evolve our business and execute on opportunities. In everything we do, we focus on driving profitable growth. We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders for our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Brady over for the questions. Thank you. Let me start and then I'll hand it over to Matt. I think what we saw in the first quarter was very much the momentum. We start building I would say end of the third and into the fourth when it comes to both how we converted our customers to be part of our journey with the more segmented approach. And that we have seen through the quarter when it comes to our gross ads that many of the initiatives we have had all the way from the welcome plan and many of the others they have been working well for us that partly is what we have been doing. And then, of course, I think we're much more focused. And, of course, now with the new team in place as well where we have full alignment with Sampath when it comes to the execution here and seeing that we're getting the right customers in. I think that has been helpful as well. Then as you have seen we're coming in and out of the quarter with promotions. We really are taking the opportunity when we see that we have an opportunity to bring in customers. So that's how are you seeing the momentum continue. And as Matt said also in his opening here, we have seen that momentum continuing for us. And for the churn, I will hand it over to Matt. But as I said I mean we had a little bit higher in the beginning of the quarter and it continued to improve. And we're working with both that as well as we continue to create the momentum we have right now on the consumer wireless. Matt? Thank you, Brett. First of all, we're really pleased with the performance on the fixed wireless access. The team is doing a great work. And remember, it's not only the consumer side, it's the business side as well. On the business side, many new use cases are coming up on using fixed wireless access. So, the team are scaling and we're on scale right now. So, like the rhythm, I see on our sales motions right now and if you see in the first quarter, almost 400000. When it comes to the network, you know that later -- the latter part of this year in December actually -- or we will get our next chunk of C-band. Right now, we're covering some 70 markets out of over 400. It's 330 markets left, we will get the C-band. And we clearly pointed out in the opening here that, we opened a C-band. We're not only seeing fixed-wireless access opportunity. We also see step-ups and a greater upgrade cycle for our customers because they see the improvements on the C-band. So we're very encouraged by the C-band coming out. But as I said, we're waiting for the clearance by the year-end to get even more. But as we roll out, right now, we open up markets. And remember, we talked about that we are in the network team, we're now decentralizing, so we can attack locally, because we are sort of opening markets locally. The same goes what Sampath is working on right now is also taking his operations more locally, so we can both the marketing and execution locally. And you might have seen it that we do more local things, because as we open up more on fixed wireless access, we do that locally. And so far our success rate is high. We're just going to go do this in the right way to take the learnings with us doing better all the time. We also have started with differentiation on different type of peers when it comes to our fixed wireless offerings. There's a lot more to be done there. But as I said, I'm very pleased with the rhythm and the market share we're taking and remember, the C-band so far is deployed mainly in urban and suburban areas, where the majority of the spectrum coming is actually in more of the suburban and rural. And we also get of course more urban spectrum as we're only deploying 60, maybe 80-some megahertz, 100 where we are in average 160. So, I have to say, this is one of the biggest 5G used cases we have right now and we really see good traction. So that's how we're going forward. Thank you, Simon. On the capacity, the guys is great. First of all were used on an initial trends of spectrum that we're using as I said, we were fixed wireless access on the ultra-wideband. We have so much more capacity coming. On top of that, all the new features you have with advanced 5G carrier action we have new devices coming out that can handle different spectrum. So there are so many more things, I feel really confident that, we will manage this capacity without any problems to the levels we have talked about and way beyond that. Then of course, as I talked with many of you guys, if it comes a moment that we have a community that have a lot of fixed will have over time other opportunities of sales splitting, et cetera. We are not even close to that today. So, I feel really good about, how the guys are managing the network and the opportunities we're building on our C-band here. As I said on the 4G fixed price actions, they were more opportunistic and selling when we see that we have capacity, but not sort of where we see that we have that full. We're not selling any more. But this expansion is right now on 5G Ultra Wideband. When it comes to the new team the big changes I've seen first of all, the first big change is that these guys are operational day one. I mean, both Kyle and Sampath straight into. If you look at Sampath, he's very much focused both on the customer dimension and seeing that we were improving the momentum we have right now on gross ads and churn and see that we actually improving through the year. But it also works with our offerings and our operations see that we're even stronger locally. Kyle on the other hand continuing the work of Sampath great momentum on Business Wireless as we continue this quarter private networks is really taking off. And then on top of that working with a wireline decline to see that we're taking out cost at the same time managing our contract and I don't think there's no one better than Kyle. He knows the network that more than anybody else. So I think that's the main focus and they've been really fast. And then of course the transitions between Tony and Matt is going extremely simple because these guys have worked together for 10 years. Tony is already into all the operations working very closely with the new leaders all the way from Joe that's running networking Kyle and Sampath. So I feel good. I feel really good and confident about it and it's very clear that the priorities there. So maybe, Tony you can say something about your priorities. Okay. That was a lot of questions in one. I will start on the high level here on the \u2013 as we said earlier, the payment patterns are basically same as pre \u2013 we have a high-quality customer base. We see this is very healthy at the moment all the way. I will ask Matt to expand on that because looking backwards. And then when it comes to the question on prepaid or value segment yes, as we said in an opening here, I mean the negative number is I would say 100% coming from SafeLink, which is a government-subsidized brand. But there are other puts and takes there as well. I think that the visible brand is doing well. We're just ramping up total wireless which is an important piece of it not having all the things coming through there. So \u2013 and then of course we have the network migration still happening. So it's combination of a lot of things on the different brands. Our confidence is that we will improve that at the latter part of the year when some of these things are moving out. So that's a general comment maybe on the churn piece Matt, if you say something. I will start and then I will toss the question on cost to Tony, and I will start with your second question. So the team, I think, we just need to divide the wireless question that you have. On the business side, I think, it's clear we're really strong. We are taking market share. The team is working through SMB government and large enterprises with our offerings where the network is the key contributor. Kyle will continue that work and the drumbeat we have there. On the consumer side, I think, that Sampath and I are 100% the line that we are in a momentum where we are now going to continue to improve our net additions on consumer, but most importantly is to grow in the service revenue. But of course, we want customers as well. But mostly important is growing the service revenue and expanding the cash flow and EBITDA. That's really the main focus for Sampath that were 100% the line on. But that also means that we need to take customers. And I think that we will continue to evolve our proposition and coming with new products. So I feel encouraged what I've seen so far and the thinking that Sampath and the team have, but we need to stay tuned for some of the new things coming, Tony? I can start. I mean we -- I can on a high level say, we continue to see the trend from our customer on postpaid going to unlimited and then go to unlimited premium. That continues to team is doing great work to see that we're doing that transition. And -- but we still have opportunities. We still have customer meter plans. We still have a portion or One Unlimited can go to unlimited premium. So we still see that as an important growth trajectory for our ARPU going forward. And then on the upgrades, I mean, we have talked about before, I mean, the market indication is that, it's going to be a little bit smaller switcher pool. That doesn't mean that we feel that we shouldn't be taking more fair share. We should definitely do that and continue to see that our customers that we have, we're expanding with them and then we're actually bringing new customers. So, I think, that's what we see right now. But, again, we have good momentum with all the offerings we have. I expect my consumer team come out with new offerings as well. So -- and continue that drum beat. Matt? I will start here. First of all, what we see right now is we have a clear value proposition when we roll out the C-band. We have great, great uptake step-ups from our customers when they see the C-band. And you know better than anybody else how much of that spectrum we have right now, which is a very little bit. And with all that we get this momentum that's why I feel so good about it. And then as Matt said our churn a little bit elevated, but it's also improving in the quarter. So, we're working on that. And having a gross the gross add momentum at the same time. That tells you something about where we're going right now heading. And then we have Sampath in the role that really know operational execution. So, I think we have all that and we have the best network clearly and it's just going to get better. I mean with every measurement we do right now, we are clearly come out as number one. And the only thing I know for sure, we're going to extend that leadership with the C-band continue to roll out. So, our proposition is very clear continue to have the best network have a good proposition for our customer because you need to continue to do new offerings to the consumer group because their behaviors are changing as well. That's why we came with it +play. We're listening to customers to make it easier and all of that. And you haven't seen the loss from us. So, I think that we're building on all the strength we have and those strengths are even getting stronger. So, on the network you're absolutely right. We have on the C-band where you started to roll it out in the majority of the 60, 70 markets we're rolling out right now, we're using 60 megahertz. And you know we have an average 160 megahertz and in many places even up to 200 megahertz. So, it's an enormous difference when it comes from 60 to 160 megahertz, how much more capacity there is and on top of that of course we are adding new type of software features like carrier gauge [ph], the chip is getting better in devices both the handset and the fixed wire access devices. So, that's going to enhance the capacity for us. And as I said we were very focused to see that we materialize our business cases for the C-band all the way from consumer and business wireless to fixed wire access and mobile edge compute and private networks. So, we focus on the revenue generation of it and we'll continue to do so. But clearly it's going to be a step-up when we get the next tranche. And we're going to open more homes for households penetrated with fixed-line access and we're going to have much more markets covered by the C-band. So, we're just going to continue that journey as fast as we can. I would say as we said from the beginning which many people doubted, we can use our existing 4G grid for the C-band. There is -- we don't need any new. However, we always build some new sites. We find new areas where there have been capacity constrained. We'll continue to do that as well. But mainly our C-band is using the 4G grid in order to see that the coverage is coming out there. And this year we're going to build a little bit more sizeable [ph] than we've normally done and the -- and our 4G spectrum, AWS and et cetera is covering 300 million pops a day. And that's where we be large band right now. I think it's crystal clear. Our metrics that we're measured on is the service revenue and the EBITDA and cash flow expansion. You still need to have customers for that and you need to grow that. But ultimately that's what we measure ourselves on to see that we can grow that. And that's what you have seen from us right now. And you see the cash flow in the quarter. We are very focused on that. We think that's very important for all the stakeholders. And so then, of course, units are important but it's even more important to see that we have the right growth metrics when it comes to the company's finance. But maybe Tony wants to add something here. That's clear. I mean and that's why our organization both on the consumer side and the business side and our network side it's more regional right now, because we're following the deployment of the network and doing marketing and outreach to our customers on fixed virus access that really want to have it when we open up. So clearly you're right there is also opportunity in the urban places where we get more capacity or more coverage and as it goes for the suburban and the rural. You need to repeat the first question. You're talking about SaaS revenues? Yes. We don't disclose the SaaS revenue specifically. So yes. In general, I think the churn characteristics all the new customers coming in is even better than before for many reasons as you said yourself. And then the type of customers I think Matt talked a little bit on the type of gross adds we're getting is new customers to Verizon, where they come in. And of course, we have opportunities to upgrade them, step up them and also having opportunities for our converged offerings. So really good quality of the customers coming in as Matt said, as well. So we feel really good about the growth momentum we have and the customers we are getting."

            "name": "Matthew Ellis",
            "content": "Yeah. No, exactly, Hans. And, Mike, good morning. So as you think about it, the strategy is one always to get the customer in, then have the opportunity to move customers up the stack and you see we've done that number of different ways over the years and you should expect us to continue to find ways to do that. And then, also, we get the opportunity to add other things to the account, so fixed wireless access allows us to increase ARPU and adding other devices to the accounts too. So there's still significant opportunities there for us to grow share of wallet with the customer as we go forward. And I would expect that the consumer team will continue to make sure that they are having the right pricing constructs and offerings in front of customers and those will constantly evolve over time, so that we can continue to grow ARPU. Yeah. So I'll take the first shot. Look, ACP is an important program. As you've seen, the actions we've taken over the past few years, whether it's the acquisition of TracFone, the introduction of plans like Welcome. We want to participate in all customer segments. That includes ACP, whether that be on the wireless side or the fixed side. So we do participate in those programs. And then, as the BEAD programs come out, we will look for where it makes the most sense for us to participate in those programs. We've been doing -- we've been building fiber out to homes for a long time. We continue to do so. Over 500,000 new OFS last year, we said we'd do something in that same region again this year and into the foreseeable future at that type of run rate. So as that -- those new programs help us the opportunities to continue to do that, we'll certainly be very interested in looking at using them where it makes sense."

            "name": "Matt Ellis",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans. And good morning. Our results for the first quarter reflect the steps we have taken to improve our performance. C-band and the investments in our network are having a positive benefit on customer and overall network experiences. And as Hans mentioned, we are seeing a direct benefit around fixed wireless and phone gross adds among other metrics, where we operate C-band but more work remains to be done. Taking a look at operating results of the first quarter, let's start with consumer postpaid phones, which had $263,000 net losses for the quarter compared to $292,000 net losses for the prior year period. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds was strong across the quarter, up over 11% year-over-year continuing the momentum from the second half of last year. Our efforts around the segmentation of our base and our more targeted go-to-market approach and offerings to those different customer groups have been key drivers behind our improved gross add performance. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.84%, up 7 basis points compared to the same period last year. We are now seeing a return of involuntary churn rates to pre-pandemic levels. As for voluntary churn, performance was mixed across the quarter starting off elevated as we saw normal holiday season activity extend into the early parts of the first quarter. But as the quarter progressed, we saw improvements in terms of year-over-year churn performance, exit in the quarter with voluntary churn rates in line with last year. While we have more work to do to improve consumer net adds, we are encouraged by the double-digit percentage improvement in gross adds combined with the improved churn level at the end of the first quarter. We entered the second quarter with significantly better momentum than a year ago. Moving on to the business segment. Verizon business again delivered strong results. We saw solid demand across our three customer groups and had 136,000 phone net adds for the first quarter compared to 256,000 for the same period last year. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a couple of large deals that contributed to our net adds results a year ago. Additionally, we saw an increase in churn due to business customers being more cautious around spending and the restructurings Hans noted in his remarks. Moving along to broadband on a consolidated basis, we delivered 437,000 net additions in the first quarter, the most in a decade. As expected, we saw another quarter of sequential growth in fixed wireless with 393,000 net adds, up from 379,000 in the prior quarter. Customer satisfaction remains high as evidenced by NPS scores, as well as encouraging churn trends around the more tenured cohorts of customers. On the fire side, Internet net adds for the first quarter was 67,000, up from 60,000 in the first quarter of last year. Customers continue to be attracted to our high-quality broadband products, which is reflected in the year-over-year increase in FiOS gross adds even in an environment with lower move volumes versus the prior year. FiOS retention rates continue to be strong with our best churn performance in more than five years. While the first quarter results were prepaid were below our expectations, we remain confident in the value market opportunities and the benefits of having a portfolio of assets and plans to satisfy the needs of all of our customers. You heard from Hans some of the actions we are taking to create long-term value. As expected in the short-term these actions are having a negative impact on our prepaid net ads. Together with the elevated disconnects and our SafeLink brand that Hans referenced, we expect pressure on prepaid net adds to increase in the second quarter before they abate later in the year. Moving on to the financials. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $32.9 billion, down 1.9% year-over-year primarily due to equipment revenue being lower by 9% as well as continued declines in business wireline services. Wireless service revenue was $18.9 billion, up 3.0% year-over-year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, results for the first quarter included a benefit of approximately 185 basis points associated with the large allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue. This benefit was partially offset by the impact associated with the shutdown of our 3G network completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The shutdown resulted in the removal of approximately 1.1 million retail connections and the corresponding loss of revenue for the first quarter and beyond. We continue to see pressure on service revenue from the cost of promotions and the amortization impact in the first quarter. Additionally, we see pressure from prepaid revenue as a result of lower subscribers versus prior year. To help offset these pressures, we've recently implemented additional pricing actions across our business and consumer segments. We expect to see the benefits of these actions ramp across the second quarter as the business segment began billing customers closer to the end of the first quarter, while consumers started earlier this month. As a result of these combined pricing actions, we anticipate approximately $75 million of incremental quarterly revenue moving forward. Additionally, the consumer team is working to improve efficiencies around device promotions and credits that we expect to yield revenue benefits across the remainder of the year. We believe that the actions the teams are taking will grow the top line driving both EBITDA and cash flow. To complement this, the team expects to make additional progress across 2023 on the development and implementation of cost efficiency initiatives resulting in a meaningful savings run rate at the end of the year. During the first quarter, operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were down 2.4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volume which helped to offset an increase in bad debt of approximately $200 million. Similar to involuntary churn rates, bad debt expense reflects the return of collections to pre-pandemic levels. While up year-over-year, bad debt expense is relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter totaled $8.3 billion, compared to $6.8 billion in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to working capital improvements, driven by lower inventory levels, coupled with fewer upgrades and a modest improvement in customer payment patterns, despite the current macroeconomic conditions. CapEx for the quarter came in at $6.0 billion, which includes most of the remaining $1.75 billion of C-band-related spending in our guidance. With the conclusion of the program, we would expect a step down in the pacing of overall CapEx throughout the remainder of the year and continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion versus last year. Total unsecured debt for the quarter was $132.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion compared to the end of 2022 and $5.3 billion lower year-over-year. This resulted in net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times as of the end of the first quarter. A 0.1 times improvement compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat from the prior quarter. We continue to have very low near-term unsecured debt maturities with the only maturity remaining in 2023 and being approximately $600 million due in the second quarter. I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be my last earnings call as Verizon's CFO. It has been a fulfilling 10 years at Verizon and a privilege to serve as CFO and I'm thankful to everyone that has made it such a rewarding experience. From our talented finance team to my fellow executive team members to all of you that have had the pleasure of getting to know, I want to say thank you. Verizon is in good hands with Tony as its CFO. I've worked closely with him since my first day at the company and I know he will always strive to drive the business forward in a way that puts Verizon and its shareholders first. I truly look forward to seeing what he and the entire Verizon team will achieve, as I chair them on from the sidelines, as an enthusiastic customer and shareholder. With that, I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments, before we open up to your questions. Thanks Hans. Good morning John. So on the churn side; certainly we saw improvement as the quarter went on. We had a lot of carryover from holiday level churn in January by the time we got to March we saw a much better momentum there. So that's the jump-off point as we go into second quarter. The pricing changes that you mentioned in your question really didn't go into effect until we came to the moving from Q1 to Q2, so that will be incremental to the results of the business here as we get into the rest of the year. So -- but as Hans said really a case of rebuilding from the momentum last year that was a year ago was not where we wanted it to be. At the midpoint of the year, we talked about taking actions and you see the results of those actions showing up in the results. And so the team is focused on continuing to build from there. Yes. So, thanks, Phil. So looking at the churn and the bad debt and to your question was more around the bad debt side. So certainly up a little bit year-over-year but more importantly flat sequentially. And what you're really seeing is first quarter last year we still had some impacts in there of some of the COVID-related activities. That's now fully out. And I'd say we're back to [indiscernible] run rate. In terms of the \u2013 with the lower upgrades in there, also the plus 11% phone growth adds, Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks a lot of those growth adds were new to Verizon. And those new to Verizon customers typically come in at a different bad debt accrual rate than upgrades which is existing customers that we know well and so that's the trade-off there. The other thing I look at on the bad debt side. One, you see from our most recent ABS filings at our FICO scores across our base continues to be very strong. We've talked for many years now about the quality of the Verizon postpaid base and you see that there. And then secondly, the payment patterns we actually had from customers this quarter actually just slightly better sequentially in terms of the aging. So we're seeing good behavior, good payment activity from our customer base, which is why you see the flat bad debt on a sequential basis now that we're fully through the COVID period. A little bit but nothing material, but that's obviously, certainly something the team is very focused on going forward having that opportunity in the got that's still ahead of them to be a much more meaningful contributor going forward. But overall, I mean it's not the largest part of that customer group you should be a fair assumption from."

We got a couple of items that I need to cover upfront first. And I'm missing the clicker. Is there a clicker? Okay, there we go. Safe Harbor statement. So, our presentation today contains things about statements that they are forward-looking and contain risks and uncertainties. Those are covered on our website with the Safe Harbor statement. A couple of items. Also, we had some non-GAAP disclosures or non-GAAP items in the presentation. The reconciliations of those are provided on the website. Next slide, please. And one administrative item for today, the camera is going to be focused on the stage during live Q&A. For the folks in the audience ask that you announce your name and your firm when called on for Q&A. With that, we're really excited for the content today. So let me hand it over to Hans and we'll get going. Hans?\nHans Vestberg: Good morning. And welcome to Verizon Third Quarter Earnings Call as well as a Broadband Update. Very happy to see so many in the room, but of course, also happy for everyone joining on the webcast. Let me kick this off. I'm going to -- we have an agenda that is pretty simple. I'm going to talk about the highlights of the third quarter, then we're going to do some -- a little bit of strategic updates and we're going to end up with Tony talking about the results and capital allocation. So, let me start by talking about the third quarter. And maybe before I start with the third quarter, just mentioning the hurricanes that has been going through our southern part of country and had devastating impacts. Verizon, of course, has worked tirelessly to see that our communications up, is so essential that communication is working for public safety, but also for the communities that are affected. Initially, in some of the states, we had challenges, especially with power, but I think that our team did a fantastic job to get our networks up pretty quickly. So, again, this is things that are happening constantly around the world right now in hurricanes and natural disasters. For us, building the networks, as we are always doing, is extremely important to see the resilience and on the network during this time. So, starting with that, talking a little bit about the results. I have a tie today. That means it's a good a good result. It is result. I'm really pleased with what I've seen them. I've talked to you so many times that there are years when you are a CEO where you're performing better than others. And I know that 2023 wasn't the highlight of my career at Verizon, [indiscernible] what we have done great job since then. Started in 2023 in the midyear of starting changing the products and all of that and then coming around where we are right now. Looking at the financial, growing 2.7% in the wireless service revenue is great. I'm also proud to report the biggest profit EBITDA in the history of Verizon, $12.5 billion in the quarter, which is really good and its multi-factors. And of course, the team sitting over there have done a great job. Proud of that. We continue to create good cash flow, $6 billion in the quarter, continue with a really strong cash flow generation as that is part of our measurement and how we measure ourselves. On the operational side, we started getting an even better balance on the postpaid side. We were 239,000 net adds positive. Sampath will talk about what happened in the consumer, but I already now going to tell him, he did a great job in the postpaid, but also in the prepaid. We were turnaround prepaid. We got a lot of questions over the years. Now we're around approximately 80,000 ex SafeLink. And of course, the business side did a great job on wireless again. Kyle and his team is consistently between 125,000 to 150,000 net adds every quarter, and I'm really pleased with that. The broadband side, I promised you now for quite a long time. As soon as I get into 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers, are going to come back to what we're going to do after that for slides down. I will talk about that. But first of all, I'm going to take a victory lap that we're 15 months ahead of the target we outlined when we bought the C-band with our fixed wireless access. Again, a great product, great work. At the same time, for the ones that remember, we were a little bit weaker on Fios in the second quarter because there was a little bit of movements in the market with ACP and all of that. Now we're back to normal again. The team is doing great work with Fios. All-in-all, a great quarter for broadband. And we continue with the private networks and the mobile edge compute. We announced two deals this quarter, but we had way more. FIFA and MSG, Madison Square Garden Group, all are buying private networks using our capabilities in dense areas to see that they can fulfill their fans or the customers' experiences. All-in-all, we feel good about the full year financial guidance that we gave earlier in the year. We even said, if you have read the press release, which I hope that all of you have done, that when it comes to the wireless service revenue and EBITDA, we are at midpoint or above on both of them for the full year. That's how good we feel about the performance so far in the year. That's what I have to say about the third quarter. Tony will come back and go a little bit deeper. If I then come in to talk a bit about the strategy. Some of this is given for you, for me, it's a journey where we are today. It's a long journey with a lot of things, and we are very organized structure company, what we're doing. The first phase, I call it sort of building the foundation. Some of you remember the heavy investment in fiber, the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, all of that was enormously important for today's work. I mean on the table in front of you have your consumer connection report. That's what we give out twice a year with all the stats what's happening in the network. Last time, we told you that our network, the last five years, grew 129%. If you haven't built it with our own fiber with the transport networks we have done and all these fundamentals that Kyle and Joe has built, we can't handle all these data and have the best network in the nation when it comes to wireless and broadband. So the fundamentals we did with go-to-market, with consumer and business is really paying off today. And you see it when our product has started resonating with the market is because we have Kyle and we have Sampath, both of them thinking about how to meet the customer demands and what the customer needs to have. So all-in-all, that was important. The second phase, all of you remember, we sold -- we bought a lot of assets. We sold everything in Verizon Media Group. We bought the TracFone that is paying off right now. We also bought the C-Band, enormously important you're going to hear Joe talking about the C-Band, but we all know where we deploy this C-Band, we have a great financial success and customer impact. So very important movements we did in that. But we also launched a lot of new products, fixed wireless access, myPlan, myHome and a lot of other things that we now have as the base going into 2025. And now we're also extending our TAM with a couple of larger investments we're doing all the way from Frontier, but also what we want to talk to in a second. So for me, this journey is now in a moment where we have the have the right assets. We have right the right team, and we have great products for our customers. Only the last, I would say, six months, we have done all of these strategic movements in order to strengthen ourselves to continue to be clearly the number one in the market and extending that. You have seen them all, the customer-first offerings we have done, resonating with our customer. We're going to hear Sampath talk about them. The refreshed brand we did in June, that takes time to get the impact, but we see the positive movement with a refreshed brand that is supporting our new products, really happy with that. And hopefully, some of you are looking at commercials, highly digitally, or on TV, and see how we're trying to recapture and rethinking the way we're showing up for our customers. We have the plan, Frontier acquisition. We talked about that in a separate session. We're excited about that and adding to our expanded TAM. We did a tower transaction just two seconds on that. Of course, this was cash in. But more importantly, we only do the deal when we can see a deal that's actually creating more \u2013 more opportunity for us, both by having a cost level that is predictable for us, very important. I like [Indiscernible] economics in the network; and second, also creating more competition in the market. We are suddenly creating with a strategic partner in Vertical Bridge, another strong partner in the market, giving more optionality and seeing that we can have a predictable cost for our tower leases, which is one of the few things we're not having 100% ownership on. We also yesterday, I think, announced that we're buying some spectrum US Cellular. It's going to take time until that's come into fruition because it's hanging on another acquisition. So I don't think it's going to be cash out until 2026. It's just adding capacity. It's a buy versus build in that region. So we're adding capacity there. And then we will not speak so much about AI today, but I hope you're going to add some questions to Kyle, because not only even efficiencies that Sampath is talking about in the customer care and personalization, we see with our compute storage, with our power and the mobile edge compute, we see great opportunities when it comes to AI and revenues for us. And we will talk a little bit about here, but we also do it in the future, coming back a little bit more structure and talk what we're doing. But we already right now see a good tractions on what we're doing on the front end of it. All in all, that's sums it up where we are today. I think we have an unmatched value proposition all the way from our best mobility, American's best mobile networks. We created a satellite partnership recently. We have myPlan, plus all the business and business offerings, strong offering. And then on the broadband side, all the way from Fios to fixed wireless access, we're now almost 12 million broadband customers, 11.9. The fixed wireless access are generating more than $550 million per quarter in revenue started three years ago. So we can see that we can build on this network, where we build the network once and we want as many profitable connections on top of it. It started paying off without. So we're uniquely positioned in the market with onerous economics. So all that said, we\u2019re already in the quarter, where are we going as a company? We know also that we hit sort of our targets on broadband. So we're going to talk today about what we're doing next. So our broadband targets going forward is basically going to say that we're going to double the fixed wireless access targets by 2028 to 8 million, 9 million fixed wireless access subscribers. Joe will talk a little bit what we're doing and how we continue, and I expect that Joe, our Head of Network continue to have capacity way beyond and continue to build for us so we are ready to capture this opportunity that were created. We also want to talk about our acceleration on Fios. We think that's a great opportunity for us to do that in this moment. We will, as we have closed the Frontier acquisition, have more than 30 million passings -- fiber passing. And we also see a clear path of somewhat to 35 million to 40 million passings after Frontier and what we're doing ourselves. And if you combine that with our fixed wireless access, I think in the future, we're going to cover more than 100 million households. So, clearly, the broadband, together with the mobility, together with our offerings, we are putting ourselves up to a possibility to continue to have sustainable growth on our service revenue, but also continue to expand our EBITDA and cash flow. And the ones that have been following us for time, you know those three all the things were measured on. Those are the three things that management are measured on. The Board has decided those are the three things that are actually driving the most shareholder value. And that's what we're focused on here right now. So, I will let my team now explain a little bit about where we are and how we're going to execute on these targets. And then we're going to hear Sampath and Tony talk about the financials and the situation. So by that, I'm going to hand over to Joe Russo.\nJoe Russo: Thank you, Hans. Appreciate it very much. Good morning everybody. The one thing I want to first say upfront is the is the network and technology team super confident that investments I'm going to talk about over the next few slides, coupled with the best engineers in the industry, is going to continue to deliver on the best, most reliable, highest performing networks for our customers and give that experience to more and more Americans across the country. It's easy to make claims about being the largest this or the fastest that, but that's not what my team and I are about. We're about building the best, most reliable networks. And that takes hard work and a lot of strategic investments that I'll talk a little bit about today. But that's hard work around testing and optimizing the network each and every day. It's strategic investments in things like generators and mobile assets for when there's emergencies. And this is why, as Hans said, following the Hurricanes Helena and Milton, the Verizon network outperformed rest of the industry, and I'm super proud that we were there when our customers and first-responders and businesses needed us the most. So, before I dive into the broadband plans, I first want to congratulate Kyle and Sampath for hitting our 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access target 15 months ahead of schedule. And that took a ton of work from a lot of people within the organization. But one of the things I'm very proud of from the network and technology team is that we built the coverage and capacity well ahead of schedule for them to deliver on that target. And as we look forward to the -- here we go. As we look forward to this new doubling of our fixed wireless access subscribers, my team's objective hasn't changed. It's to build the coverage and capacity well ahead of schedule and we're already doing that. We expect that to cover another 30 million homes over the next four years on our award-winning multipurpose network, we have to do a few things. The first is will take a mobility-first approach, and I'll talk more about that in a minute. But getting to 90 million homes and businesses covered with fixed wireless access will be accomplished with three key things we're doing today. The first is our aggressive deployment of C-Band and millimeter wave, we call ultra wideband. The second is a new MDU solution that's been in trial and we'll be rolling out in 2025 to serve MDUs with up to 1 gig Internet service with our millimeter wave technology. And the third is technology advances and the use of our vast small cell network in order to add even more ultra wideband coverage and capacity between now and 2028. So I'm going to shift gears a little bit to fiber. So I'm looking forward to the pending acquisition of Frontier and bringing these two great fiber assets together. The combined wireline footprint has approximately 48 million homes and businesses of which 25 million of those are already served with fiber. And I know one thing. With our 20-year experience in building fiber across this country, that we will continue to deploy Fios in the new footprint after closing. Post close, we will take the appropriate pace to build based on the following criteria. The first is the profitability of the build. The second is the competitive environment that we see that we're operating in. And the third is our capital allocation priorities. But over time, I want to be clear. My objective is to bring Fios to 35 million to 40 million homes across the country. So I want to bring the whole network strategy together for you. The first is, we built a shared multipurpose network with owners' economics to serve as many profitable connections as possible. That strategy is built on the foundation we call the Intelligent Edge Network, which is rooted in our rich fiber assets, both in the ultra long-haul network and in the metro networks across the country. It also encompasses our converged IP core and our own and operated Verizon Cloud platform and our mobile edge computing platform that serves both today's and tomorrow's technologies. This foundation gives my team and I the capability to provide that best, most reliable, highest performing network to two access technologies. The first is the radio access network. And again, as I mentioned, we take a mobility-first approach. What that means is I deploy coverage and capacity to enhance the mobile experience for our customers and to find new revenue streams. The good news is we pull through fixed wireless access when we do that. And as we've said, we've been awfully successful in that space. Customers just love that product. So we will be accelerating our ultra wideband deployment. I expect that by the end of this year, we'll have a -- we'll have covered 70% of our planned footprint and by the end of next year through acceleration, we will get to 80% to 90% of that planned footprint covered. We also have just recently launched our 100% virtualized 5G core network with stand-alone and slicing capabilities. And we'll talk a little bit more towards the end of this year, how we're going to put those to use in the market. And then finally, we are the only company in this country that's actually running virtualized RAN at scale. 40% of my C-Band sites are now virtualized in the network. Shifting over to fiber access network. So I've been building Fios for 20 years or so now. And we're on track this year to pass approximately 500,000 prems. Frontier, as you know, is on their way to pass 10 million prems by the end of 2026. And we are in 2025, targeting an expansion of our Fios build up to 650,000 prems. Post-close, I see that pace growing to up to 1 million plus prems per year. But what excites me more than anything, after 20 years of doing this, is our business case on Fios is getting better and better. And that starts with the fact that customers demand high-quality broadband services more now than ever. So what we see is when I do a build today, we see higher and faster penetration rates than we have with prior builds. And we pulled through mobility benefits on both churn and ARPU. But I'm also finding new and creative ways to bring down the cost of deploying fiber. And that comes in three big chunks. The first is partnerships with companies like Corning and CommScope, where they're delivering technology to do both reduction in the amount of fiber I have to deploy to serve homes and the techniques and technologies that make it easier for my team to deploy. The second is, we've made with Sean Carr\u2019s [ph] help, 20 years of systems and tools improvements through the whole process of building, designing, operating the network and we're seeing great benefits from those systems and tools enhancements in the reduction of rework, efficiency of our build and operating of the network. And then the third is, we've made some strategic decisions of how to get legacy costs out of our network without having to deploy fiber to the entire wire center. So I can use other techniques to move customers to new technologies and remove legacy equipment without having to deploy fiber across an entire footprint. But our network strategy is clear. To build and operate the best, most reliable, highest performing network to power and empower how our customers live, work and play. Let me leave you with this. My goal is to ensure more and more Americans have access to that best, most reliable network experience, by expanding the best mobile and broadband networks through a disciplined capital approach. We do that by building the best networks. And over time, that includes a 5G ultra-wideband network that will serve 300-plus million Americans with 5G advanced features for today's and tomorrow's technology. And a fixed wireless access and Fios network that will serve over a 100 million homes and businesses. So I'm going to turn it over now to Sampath, who will talk through how he'll ensure more customers get access to those great network experiences. Thanks, Sampath.\nSowmyanarayan Sampath: Joe, thank you. Very good morning to all of you. There are two things that Joe spoke about that really excites me. The first one is America's best wireless network continues to get bigger and even better. And the second one is our ability to offer broadband to 100 million homes and businesses over a period of time. So with that, let me get into how we go about this. Verizon is in a very unique position right now because we have two engines of growth: mobility and broadband. Both these segments, both these businesses have secular tailwinds, there's huge demand for both of the products. And more importantly, Verizon has a good position and a lot of opportunity to grow in front of it. Let's start with mobility. Look, in mobility, we are number one. If we look at our share position, our total revenue. And it starts with our postpaid business. We are seeing continued momentum in our postpaid business. With this quarter, we would have had seven quarters of consecutive year-on-year postpaid phone gross ad momentum that we have in the business. And why did that happen? Some of it has to do with our sales engine that we've gone and reengineered, get back to the local market structure, local sales incentives, local marketing. And the second is myPlan. myPlan, as I say, is on plan. Customers love it. They like the structure of it, they like the ability to get access to unique offerings and it's truly differentiated in the market. And you saw us, we had a strong quarter, 81,000 phone net adds in the space. We will be postpaid phone net add positive with second number, without second number, this year as well as promised in our plan to do that. Next, we turn our attention to our value business or prepaid. And we bought TracFone, we've integrated TracFone and we had really strong momentum in our business. We had 80,000 net add positive in our business, the best in many quarters, and a lot of that comes down to a core performance of our brands. We saw almost all our brands have very strong performance and momentum in this space. Two, our exclusive distribution with total wireless has scaled up really well, and you can see those stores everywhere. And third is our unique distribution position that we have within Walmart. And you're going to see continued progress and continued momentum in our value business going forward. That brings me to our third topic, which is churn. Now that we have our postpaid engine working well, our value turnaround in progress, I can turn my attention to the churn. There is nothing structurally that prevents Verizon from being an industry leader in retention and lower churn. We've been in that position before. We know how it feels. And more importantly, we know how we get there. In the short-term, we made some trade-offs, some strategic trade-offs that Hans and I feel very good about to drive shareholder value. We had some pricing actions that do drive some churn in this space. But on balance, we feel very good about how we executed those and often churn is way less than some of our business cases that had come in. The second is we are very disciplined about our retention spend. You see that in our upgrade numbers. We -- it has to be demand-led, customers have to want it, and we link our retention promotions the plans and the price plans that they have there. But over a period of time, you should expect lower churn from us from a couple of things. The first one is better experience. We are using AI significantly both at stores at our call centers. Second is myPlan and perks, as more and more and of our base gets into the myPlan construct and takes more perks that helps with churn. Third is myAccess or Verizon Access, our loyalty program, which I'll cover in a bit, that could give us traction in that. And then the last one, which is probably the biggest lever is going to be more mobile plus home customers. When those two customers come together, we see a huge reduction in churn, and that's going to apply to a larger base as we expand our broadband offering more piece. The fourth is margin accretive add-on services. In form of perks, in form of adjacent services, it's a continuous growth, and it's being very innovative every time we do that. We are taking the same approach we have to mobility to our broadband space. It first starts with momentum in sales. You saw that this quarter strong momentum in sales on Fios and FWA. Similar tactics, similar promotions. But the construct is that same momentum we have and the same energy we bring to our broadband business as well. myHome has been a very successful launch. A lot of our base tends to like the perks. They are taking on our new customers when they come on board, they take on perks, and they like the ability to share their perks between mobile and home. And also sustained growth in ARPU, when you build a long-term sustainable subscription business like we've done, you have to balance P&Q. Over a period of time, I've spoken about this 80-20 contribution to service revenue because that's the big measure we measure ourselves on is service revenue. I think with a positive four net add trajectory, strong FWA and Fios performance, we are on track to get to that 80-20 mix over a period of time. Now, we are in a very unique position. I think the only the only company, carrier, who has a scaled position in both FWA and in the fiber business. And both these are top products, when you combine them together you get access to 100 million homes and businesses in the country. No other carrier offers that amount of coverage and depth that we offer in terms of serving our customers. Let's dig into each of these one by one. The first is FWA. Joe just spoke about moving from 60 million to 90 million homes and businesses covered. But what's interesting about the FWA basis, it's a quality prime customer base. Our FICO score on FWA is north of 700. So it's a really strong customer base. And the reason is it's a high price value equation. There's a huge segment of the market who love that. And because of that, you see very high NPS scores. I mean think about it, you could finish this. You could go to a store in five minutes, buy it, and in 10 minutes after that, you could be in your apartment connected with the 5G Verizon FWA product. It's a huge competitive advantage. High NPS is a competitive advantage. Our pricing construct is a competitive advantage. We do not like promotions that roll off. You get a customer on one price point and in two years, you -- the price changes. It's annoys customer. And that's one of the reasons why it's a huge competitive advantage for us because we continue to lead with that. And then you have fiber. Joe spoke about 20 years. He's been working a little longer than 20 years in the fiber business. Look, we are the OG fiber players. Some people think it's a new thing. We've been in this thing for 20-plus years. And every year, we find that the new cohorts that we bring on have better penetration than some of our older cohorts even because we get better. Joe gets better with the build, we get better with selling it, we're targeting it, using digital to bear in those pieces to do that. But what's interesting is it's a white-glove experience. Very, very high NPS scores that we have, very low churn. And most, a majority of our customers who come and take our Gig Plus plan. Again, that's a competitive advantage around high NPS, high customer satisfaction. So over a period of time with 100 million premises covered, we have a differentiated offering. We have an offering that is steered. We have an offer that is segmented. FWA and fiber, and customers will choose. At the end of the day, we want customers to choose what's right for them, and we're going to be very transparent on what the pricing is and what the value prop is to grow that. And talking of value prop, I want to spend some time talking about the Verizon model of convergence. The Verizon model of convergence is margin accretive. It is revenue accretive and has very attractive ROIC. And at the end of the day, it is demand led. I do not believe in giving away one product to sell the other, or giving away one product to hold on to the other. We think we have the best wireless network. We have best broadband offering. Customers want it and they're willing to pay a very fair price for it. We do have some advantages for a customer when they take both of those products together. But at the end of the day, it is demand-led, because customers want to buy the best from both us to do that. Now let me talk a little bit about how this convergence comes to life. How convergence comes to life? The first one, as you see on the page, is myHome and myPlan. It's -- we launched both, and it's not a coincidence that both the offerings look very similar. You buy a base connectivity and then you have access to these really unique books. I mean, it's becoming a pretty big business for us and customers can share perks across both those plans. The second is our app. My Verizon app, we have a single app now for both for mobility and home. So once you get a mobility customer, they see a home piece and they can try out the home and they can buy the home and then vice versa to do that. And also home Wi-Fi can control everything in a single app and it does very well. The third thing is transparent pricing. It is very clear to customers what their savings are. And we're going to keep innovating in this space. Because at the end of the day, customers want the best product, but they also want clear pricing upfront, and we do that every single time with our constructs that we have there. Fourth is distribution. We have a large distribution of stores and a digital footprint. And you can see over a period of time, we are able to distribute our Fios offering through our store network as well, and that's a huge upside to the business case. So you see that we are building the Verizon model of convergence, which is demand-led and it's accretive to us. But where does the value come for Verizon and its shareholders? Two big buckets, revenue. The first one is we will see penetration well north of 40% in our business. And as I said, every new cohort that we bring in actually gets to that a little faster than the previous cohort we do that space. And once we do that, once we acquire Frontier, and when we close on Frontier, we will we will have that as well. And then as Joe builds out new networks, we will see similar penetration levels as we do that. The second is, in some of our big markets where we have fiber, our wireless market share is 500 basis points or 5% better than if we don't have fiber. So we can cross-sell mobility to our Frontier base when we close it, to our new cohorts of fiber that are coming in, but also customers who have access to fiber, but don't have fiber today, we'll be able to cross-sell them. So two revenue upside opportunity for us as we build out our converged offering. The second is churn. A couple of data points. We see a 50% reduction in mobility churn when we bundle with fiber. And that's a huge lever for us, even broader, longer term on how we take churn down in the space. The second is a fiber churn, which is already world-class, one of the best in the world, will go down another 40% when we bundle mobility and fiber. That's a very unique position for us, and we see churn benefits on FWA as well. So what we are essentially building here is one of the world's best franchises for broadband, with FWA as well as with fiber, with best-in-class metrics. But more importantly, it's demand-led, and that's the Verizon model of convergence. Talking about demand led, a lot of the reason it's demand-led actually comes from our unique value prop. Let me start with this. The bottom of layer is our connectivity layer. Best network. Joe always says, we will be the most reliable network. That's where our value comes from. It's the same network we have for broadband, for postpaid, through myPlan and our prepaid value brands as well. And we keep tiering these. We have segments that go after it. And over a period of time, we'll have new sources of revenue. Let me touch on two of these. The first is network slicing. It's a new currency. It's something that you should -- we should talk a little more about soon. And that will have upside opportunity for us. Second is satellite connectivity. That's another new form of connectivity and then new ways to monetize our overall connectivity network. Then on top of that, you get to our entertainment and adjacent services. We call them perks, because you have to be a Verizon customer to get them. That's the perk you get for being a Verizon customer. And we right now have seven million perk subscriptions on our network. And then guess what, they're going to double by 2025. So we have a large revenue stream that customers find very compelling. It reduces churn for us and is very margin rich for us. So it covers a lot of pieces for us. And we're not stopping still. We're going to keep innovating. But to be on our network to be part of perks, it's going to have to be compelling. It's going to have to be exclusive to Verizon and something our customers want and they can save money with it. On top, we have our loyalty program. Verizon Access or if you're a customer, it's just myAccess because it's your access, because it gives you access to two things. One is always on deals to some of the best premium brands out there. But second is once in a lifetime, my kids call it bucket list type opportunities they have. For example, you can sky dive with the bronchos, or you can go to London to watch the Jacksonville Jaguars. Or we can actually toss the kind for the opening game. These are once-in-a-lifetime events for NFL, NHL, NBA and some of the best musical acts out there. I don't know if you can get tickets for Taylor Swift, but definitely check in on the Verizon myAccess plan to do that. As I wrap up, I want to leave you with two thoughts. The first is we at Verizon right now, have two engines for growth. Two engines that have secular growth in front of them, two engines that have tailwinds and where we have unique market position but huge opportunity as well. You're going to see us do the Verizon model of convergence, which is demand-led, which is give customers choice, be transparent about pricing and offer them a huge set of services on top of that. We're going to deepen our relationship with our customers and extract value for them and for ourselves in the process. The second is, over the last seven quarters, you've seen our vision and execution on the business. You're going to give a lot of confidence you're going to get from that that we will execute on that for our mobility business, our broadband business and the Verizon converged business. With that, I'm going to pass it over to Tony talk about two things; 3Q update and more importantly, capital allocation. Tony take it away.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks, Sampath and good morning. So our execution, as Sampath said is really strong, and it's fueling the momentum in our business. Our third quarter results, before we get into it, I do want to talk about the third quarter. Our ability to demonstrate customer growth and financial growth once again is a hallmark to our testament of execution day in and day out. And we delivered the highest ever reported adjusted EBITDA in our quarter. We're on track, as Hans mentioned, with our 2024 guidance, and at/or above the midpoint of our guided range for both wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA. If I go to the operational metrics from mobility, if you think about business and consumer, gross add and churn both improved year-over-year and that drove phone net adds of 239,000 in the third quarter. That's a significant improvement year-over-year. And as Sampath mentioned, we expect the consumer business to have positive postpaid phone net adds for the full year, and that's with and without the second number offering. And that's in addition to the continued strength in phone net adds from our business segment, and that's quarter after quarter of strong growth. If you think about broadband, we have almost 12 million subscribers in our base, and Fios and FWA are both growing. On broadband, we had 389,000 net adds in the quarter. That's another strong quarter for us. And inside of that, if you think about FWA, we've grown our FWA subscriber base over 1.5 million in that time period. And as you heard from the team today, there's much more opportunity for us to expand further. If we move to the financials, Hans talked about how we're measured, service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. If I start with service revenue, our service revenue is very healthy. Our wireless service revenue was up 3.1% year-to-date or $1.8 billion. Our EBITDA continues to be strong. And even in a quarter where we delivered a very strong $12.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, we took actions around revenue and cost efficiencies to set us up for 2025. That strong EBITDA led to free cash flow of $14.5 billion year-to-date, and that's consistent with the prior year. And that includes an increase of $2.5 billion in cash taxes. The cash generation of the business continues to be very strong, and we have ample flexibility and funding to execute on our capital allocation priorities. The business is performing well, and we have good momentum as we close 2024 and head into 2025. And if I shift over to capital allocation, as many of you know, we have four capital allocation priorities and they remain unchanged. Our first capital allocation priority is to invest in the business. And that includes investments in our network infrastructure. If you think about C-Band, if you think about Fios, it includes M&A to accelerate our strategy. If you think about the pending acquisition of Frontier, and it also includes being opportunistic with wireless spectrum as evidenced by the deal we signed last week with US Cellular. As we said before, we're back to BAU levels of capital spend, and we're on track with our 2024 capital program. If we look ahead to 2025 in terms of guidance for 2025, we expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion for the next year. And that's an all-in number that includes all of our growth initiatives. So that includes C-Band and the continuation of rolling out C-Band. Joe talked about having 80% to 90% of our sites on C-Band by the end of 2025. It includes our Fios continued open-for-sale expansion up to 650,000 new open for sale on Fios. And it includes the broadband MDU solution, the multi-dwelling solution that Joe mentioned. All of these things are included in that 17.5 to 18.5 number. And that range gives us the flexibility to both invest for growth and be disciplined and efficient with our capital spend. Our second priority is our commitment to the dividend. And as you've seen recently, we've raised dividend for the 18th consecutive year. That's an accomplishment we're extremely proud of. And as we said many times, our goal is to put the Board a position for further dividend increases. Our third capital allocation priority is having a strong balance sheet. We've made significant progress delevering the balance sheet since the acquisition of C-Band. As of the of the end the third quarter, our unsecured leverage stands at 2.50 times. That's the ratio of net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our focus is to continue to pay down debt between now and the closing of the Frontier deal. And today, we're announcing an update to our long-term leverage target of 2.0 to 2.25 times. Given our cash flows and overall financial strength, this is the appropriate range for our business to provide flexibility to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. Our fourth capital allocation priority is share buybacks. And as we've said many times, we will consider share buybacks but our unsecured leverage metric reaches 2.25 times, and that target is unchanged. As we work towards that target, we continue to focus on generating strong cash flows and paying down debt. Our capital allocation strategy is disciplined and deliberate. And as you've seen from our track record, we'll continue to focus on operational execution and performance and deliver on our commitments. We're excited about the opportunities we have ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. Let me summarize updates before we come to Q&A. I think you hopefully got a feeling that we are setting us up well for 2025 and beyond to continue the leadership in this market and extend it. So we talked about the networks that we're building. It should be the best and the best performing. I think that's been a focus. And really now with the C-Band coming quickly and our Fios build-out, we feel really good about it. It's been important for us to focus the last couple of years on the differentiated value proposition for our customers. We know that there are more important services than ever. To have mobility and broadband is a necessity for every organization, every person on this planet and in the United States. The differentiating offerings that we're doing are enormously important, and they come from deep research what our customer really wants. And of course, together with a refreshed brand should support us for the continuation. Tony talked about capital allocation, and you have seen us being very prudent by the capital allocation. We promised to come down to BAU levels, we're on BAU levels. We have the high [indiscernible] C-band because we saw a great opportunity to quickly come out with that, and that were coming down. We're now doing investment to expand our total addressable market with the same offering, the same network. That's the strategy we have. We stay there and we see that we can continue to grow well and continue to create profitability and cash flow. So that's the overall strategy. And we are measured on three things: the wireless service revenue, the adjusted EBITDA and the cash flow. And we are very committed, the whole team here to continue to grow the service revenue and expand the EBITDA and cash flow going into 2025 and onwards with the investments we're doing right now and where we stand with our strategy, where we stand with our assets and we stand with our offering. So all in all, we feel very positive where we are right now. We feel positive where the market is and our products. By that, I'm going to close, and we're going to have a open Q&A. Brady will help us to manage that. I have my whole management team here, and we even have a pictures on them, if you don't know who they are. They are sitting to the left here for the ones on the webcast. You can see them here. So they are all here. So I'm going to diligently distribute answers to them. Probably going to take some myself. Any questions you might have for us. Brady going to do it, remember, present yourself when you're going to answer, so the webcast audience know who is asking the question.\nA - Brady Connor: Okay. So I love the folks in the front row, but we're going to go back right to start with Simon. And again, just please announce your name and firm and since you're not on the camera.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks very much. Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Hans, I was interested in your latest thoughts on the BEAD program. You're clearly leaning into broadband. We're starting to see some of the states open up their processes. So how do you think about that as an opportunity beyond this? And then the other question would be around these markets like the Northeast where you have fixed wireless and fiber. How do you start to bifurcate that opportunity? Because I think in the past, if you had fiber, you hadn't really done fixed wireless. But does that start to blend a bit?\nHans Vestberg: I'm going to take some help from Joe later on, but I'm going to start myself first. The BEAD program is, of course, contemplated in everything we have here. In the Fios footprint, it's obvious we will go for it when it makes sense for us, both from a return on investment. And so we -- in our Fios footprint, there's going to be great opportunities for us for sure, and we will be active on it. On the second one, when it comes to fiber or Fios versus fixed wireless access, I think -- I hope that you heard from Joe our strategy on fixed wireless access is a secondary business case on mobility. So we -- first of all, we deploy our C-Band for mobility. And the agreement that Joe and I have in the whole team is that we build mobility for two reasons: revenue generation as well as customer satisfaction. And then we get a secondary fixed wireless access opportunity. So it's not really thinking about where we do Fios or we do fixed wireless access. We do Fios and we do mobility. Then we create opportunities. And -- and I always love what we are doing because we give optionality for our customers. There are customers that just kills to get Fios. But there's others that really feel that fixed wireless access is a solution they want to have because of simplicity. So we're going to create optionality. And you saw the consumer slide that Sampath showed with customer offering framework, I think it's called, where actually everything is in the same model, regardless of what it takes. So that's how we think about it. Do you want to add something? Yes, you want to add something. Please come up here.\nJoe Russo: Okay. Yeah. Just on BEAD. So we've built a very good process for managing subsidies. And we've been already receiving and winning subsidies in our Fios footprint. So as BEAD starts to get deployed, we'll deploy those same kind of standards and processes to participate. When I think about the 35 million to 40 million, it will be a very, very small percent that we think is BEAD. And we foresee that getting 35 million to 40 million will be with or without BEAD funding.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. Next?\nBrady Connor: Okay, we're going to work our way up. I'm going to go a second row. We'll go Hodulik on the end over here.\nJohn Hodulik: Thank you. I don't think you would see me behind these tall guys. First, starting with fixed wireless. Thank you guys on the new targets. Just on the quick math, it seems like the cadence is slowing a bit. You guys are doing like 360 -- 360,000 a quarter. It looks like that slows to just sort of doing it ratably to under 300,000. I just want to make sure if that's sort of what we should expect to see or if there's something different in the numbers? And then these new initiatives are great. You guys did 1.7% service revenue growth this quarter. Obviously, you don't want to give 2025 guidance -- full guidance here, but should we expect an acceleration in service revenue growth from these new issues?\nHans Vestberg: On the future guidance, I'm going to leave that to Tony. On the first question, I'm going to start. I think to some extent, you're right. So think about this, we have had a target to create and get between 350,000 to 400,000 new broadband subscribers every quarter. And I think we've had that, but I'm not sure how many quarters. Sometimes up to 400, sometimes a little bit north of 350. What is happening right now is two things. First of all, the fixed wireless access is going into in a second sort of transformation because the C-Band is not going to suburban and rural. And of course, the opportunity is equally big, but the density is way less. So, we're going to see for a while that OFS, it's going to be a little bit less. And the second one is, as we're ramping up the Fios. You saw that we are doing some 450 to 500, going to 650 is a ramp-up. So, in the short-term, I think you're going to be in the lower end of that 350. And then I think when you see the ramping up of both of them, you're going to see a little bit different. So, I wouldn't say that we have changed anything on the pace. It's just a technicality of how we build right now and how we're ramping up Fios and actually going suburban to rural with our C-Band. So, those are the things. Tony, do you want to talk about guidance 2025 now?\nTony Skiadas: Sure.\nHans Vestberg: Great. I'm eager to hear.\nTony Skiadas: Hey John, thanks for the question. So, look, as we said we said this morning, we're on track with our service revenue, and we said we'd be at or above the midpoint on service revenue. If we think about next year, I'm not going to guide on 2025 right now. But in terms of puts and takes, we've taken a lot of actions to position ourselves for sustained growth. So, that includes the P&Q that you heard from Sampath, so volume improvements in pricing, and it also includes fixed wireless access, and you see the great growth that we've seen on fixed wireless access. Prepaid, has now, Sampath mentioned, turned positive. So, that's been a headwind this year. We would expect that to start to turn next year. We're still facing headwinds with program amortization. So, those are the puts and takes as we head into next year, and we'll bring it back to you in January.\nJohn Hodulik: Right. Thanks guys.\nHans Vestberg: Next.\nBrady Connor: We're working our way up to the front row. We're going to go -- we'll go Barden here on the end, the first tall person.\nDave Barden: You don\u2019t have to sound so excited about that Brady. Dave Barden from Bank of America. Thanks Hans. So, if my base case is that the tax regime remains the same. Cash tax is going up. CapEx is going up. Working capital, if the iPhone becomes a bigger thing, it's not going down, it might go up.\nHans Vestberg: A lot of assumptions here, continue.\nDave Barden: Those are -- not so much assumptions. And then you're going to do the Frontier deal and they're not free cash flow positive. So, is the message financially to you and Tony that 2024 is the high watermark for free cash flow at Verizon because it doesn't seem like there's a lot of dials to turn to kind of make it get a lot better. And the second question, if I could, would be there's some agitators at Frontier that want you guys to pay a higher price, bid against yourselves in that process. And you spoke a lot about how important it is to have this 100 million homes passed and the Verizon version of convergence. What are you willing to do to get that deal done?\nHans Vestberg: Okay, I'll leave the capital allocation for you, but I think that, of course, you can always find headwinds. We have a lot of -- or tailwinds as well in cash flow, and we will be very focused on that. So, I will let Tony go through the puts and takes on that. On the Frontier deal, I mean, first of all, if you have read the proxy, which you probably have done, it was a competitive process. We were asked for a best and final. We gave the best and final. We have a signed agreement and a contract for a merger. Now it is up to Frontier's shareholders to make the vote. We always have different type of strategies. We will continue to have that. This fitting in well right now. We're going to see what's going to happen, but we feel really confident that this is fair and good for all stakeholders. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Hey Dave, so we're not going to guide on free cash flow, but a few things. I mean, the same puts and takes that we shared at the beginning of the year still remain intact. So, see the EBITDA growth, and that's the focus for next year. Interest, in terms of deleveraging, we'll have to see where rates go. That will have an impact. And then cash taxes, as you mentioned, they're up this year. We'll have to see what happens on the legislative front. They're going to be up -- we said $2.5 billion so far this year. We'll see where that goes. And working capital, we're not seeing a big upgrade cycle right now. The upgrades were down 10%. Right now, customers are choosing to hang on to their phones a lot longer, and that's by choice. The average upgrade rate, and Sampath can correct me, but it's probably 40 months or so. So that hasn't changed. So we're going to continue to stay disciplined and segmented in our approach and then we'll come back on our thoughts on cash flow back in January. Thanks.\nBrady Connor: I'm going front row over here to Peter next.\nPeter Supino: Hi thanks, Brady. Thanks, Hans. Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. A question on fiber. And really about the rate of expansion, your target plus a lot of other publicly available targets and the guestimate about how many private fiber passings there are in the country summed over 100 million homes. Population density observations, nobody has perfect information, lead us to think that maybe you should be in a hurry to build as many homes as you can. And yet your current velocity of expansion is still much slower than other -- a couple of other companies. Wondering, how you think about the speed at which you want to pursue the targets that you laid out here today? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I think about broadband, that's the thinking I have, and team has that as well. That means that we include both our Fios, as well as the fixed wireless access as broadband solutions. And as you have seen lately, they are doing well, both of them. And that's how we think about our customers, and we create optionality. So, I that nobody else is building on the pace that we are doing in the combination of it. That's how are we thinking. And remember, we build the network once. And then at the edge of network, we decide what type of connections we have. Sometimes it's Fios, sometimes it's 4G, sometimes its 5G, something is fixed wireless access, and then we get the best return on investment on the invested capital because we do it one. So that's the thinking we have, and that's how we serve our customers. So I feel good about the pace we have and how we're deploying this again with the financial mind in behind it to see that we get the best return on investment for our shareholders. Anybody want to add something to that? Okay, then you don't need to. Next?\nBrady Connor: Come back in the middle of the room here, we'll do Jim and then Sebastiano.\nJim Schneider: Thanks. Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Just a couple of quick questions on the network side, if I could. First is on -- just in terms of the longer term, the fixed wireless targets, do those sort include or not include any dedicated spending purely for fixed wireless? I know you said it's mobility-led, but does it of that? And talk about the part of that, which is small sales, if any? And then maybe tactically for 2025, can you maybe talk about the drivers of the CapEx increase. How much of that increase is coming on the wireless side on macro cells? How much of that is coming from fiber, et cetera? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: On the first question is no, there's no success-based fixed wireless access in the plan that we're presenting today. That's an optionality we have for the future. Right now, again, believe in our design principles because that makes the operation easier. It makes it easier for our customer, it makes it better for capital. That doesn't exclude it in the future that we will have success-based fixed wireless access. And then of course, I'm sure that Joe is building more capacity. So Kyle and Sampath has an opportunity to leverage on that. But in this plan, it's mobility first in all our C-Band. The second question is about the increase or the BAU level you have right now, how much is macro? You heard about what we said. We were trying to go to 80%, 90% of our planned radius having C-Band. And then you see the Fios up to 650. I think those are two important ones. There are other things coming down to some extent in our normal build because we have sort of come pretty far on the 4G, and we see much more traffic on the 5G. We have gone very far on our small cell with millimeter wave that is capturing a lot of our traffic in dense areas. That's a little bit smaller today. That doesn't mean we don't believe in it. We think it's super important. So I think those are the puts and takes in the CapEx. Joe?\nJoe Russo: I'll just add on small cells, and I mentioned it during, but we started probably about six months ago now deploying C-Band on small cells and have seen really good success with putting that technology on our vast small cell network, giving us more coverage and certainly more capacity for both mobile and fixed wireless access. So my view is that will continue in this four-year build program. As we'll leverage what we've done both with our millimeter wave small cells, and we had a pretty significant small cell network even for the 4G network. Leveraging now C-Band on those has really proven to be a great tool to add coverage and capacity.\nHans Vestberg: And one other thing that is increasing, which you mentioned was, of course, the MDU solution we have now for fixed wireless access, using millimeter wave. We have talked about it. We're going to put that in commercial use in next year. So that's, of course, also an opportunity, but of course, with a great return on investment.\nBrady Connor: Sebastiano, and then we'll go up here front row to Greg.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi. Sebastiano Petti, JPMorgan. I guess just following up on Jim and kind of Dave's question as well, but help us think about the shape of CapEx over the next several years because the 17.5 billion on a stand-alone basis, I guess, 17.5 billion to 18.5 billion includes the MDUs, the ultra wideband build as well as the 650...\nHans Vestberg: It's a range between 17.5 and 18.5.\nSebastiano Petti: Yes. Yes. So within that range, is there any maybe perhaps milestones or things like that, that are more elevated next year that that begin to peel off like the MDU or the ultra wideband build, should we think about it as being more steady state over the next several years?\nHans Vestberg: As I said, I think that this is a BAU level that we have in a steady state. I'm not going to guide for future years. I always said that if we see an opportunity where we can grow faster and we can invest more in CapEx, we will explain that if we go outside the normal BAU levels. Right now, we don't see that. Remember, we have talked about, there's no auctions for spectrum coming out at the moment. Usually, that is triggering or new. We don't even think 6G is in any of the plan of records we have right now. So it's a lot of things that usually catapult the higher investment level. We don't see them right now. So BAUs this level we are right now 17, 17.5 up to 18.5, that's where we're going to spend it. But ultimately, if we see opportunities, remember the capital allocation priorities, we spend it in business, but we also want to explain that is something additionally we can get and that we can share with our shareholders. But right now, the BAU levels are what you see from us right now. The big triggering events that you sometimes have, it's going to going to come 5G, its go spectrum auction. I don't have visibility of anything on that at the moment.\nSebastiano Petti: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe one for Sampath. I mean what underlies the confidence as we think about the 80/20 service revenue growth and the sustainability of, I guess, the volume side of the equation as you think about maybe tougher comps on the gross add side, the EIP dynamics and help us maybe think about the levers of sustained consumer volumes?\nSowmyanarayan Sampath: Yeah. Look, I think it comes back -- we've had seven quarters of strong gross add year-on-year growth coming into this. And all the efforts that we've put in, whether it's local marketing, going back to market structure, sales incentive, myPlan, just better execution on the ground, we continue to see gross add improvement in our business going forward. So I think that's a machine that we've gotten back to the right phase, and you're to see continued growth in that. The second comes down to churn. As I mentioned, there's nothing structurally that prevents us from getting back to leadership position on customer retention and churn. We made some short-term strategic trade-offs, which are the right things to do. But over a period of time, churn will start coming down, mobile plus home offerings, converged offerings is probably the biggest lever that we have there. But then myPlan, some of our loyalty programs and then just better execution on the churn piece as well. So you're going to see both things coming in, continued progression on gross add momentum and then better churn. When you put both of them together, that's how we're going to sustain a net add growth over period of time to do that. The second is on the price side. Look, we've had four or five price increases depending on how you count it over the last years. And in every case, the churn has been less than what we thought coming in. So customers like our product, they our offering, and you're going to see continued ways in which we can earn the trust of customer. The last one is there is another type of price increase, which has earned price increase. If you look at the chart where I had the customer offering framework, we are able to upsell our customers, upsell them on the type of plans, but also upsell them on perks and other things. We have seven million perks in our business right now. That's going to double this time next year. So you're going to see a lot of momentum on the price side just by our ability to earn those price-ups that we have. So a combination of gross adds, better churn and also ability to upsell our customer both on connectivity and some of the other offerings that we have. When you put all of that in, I get really comfortable about the LG20 [ph] framework that we laid out, that we are going on the right path to get there.\nSebastiano Petti: Good. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, we're going to go Greg [ph] in the front row over here, and then we'll start mixing around.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sure. Thanks. Another CapEx question, but more situated on the B2B opportunity. One of your peers has been putting out a few press releases on GenAI fiber. And you have a lot of fiber, both in footprint and from the One Fiber build and Jaunt XR acquisition. So I'm just curious on your latest thinking on the economics and the opportunities there.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I think I'm going to ask Kyle to comment on that. If we talk about the GenAI opportunities, I talked about a three-pronged GenAI strategy we have. We have employee experience improvements right now already in the market when it comes to call agents, et cetera. We have our personalization for customers. And then we have our revenue opportunity. And as I alluded to, given the assets we have in our network, we see great opportunities for having a chance to earn business there, which we've already done. But maybe, Kyle, you can talk a little bit more about it.\nKyle Malady: As you rightly bring up, the investments we've made before and say One Fiber and all the other fiber and all the CEOs and everything we've done, we're kind of reimagining those assets right now is how do we -- and how we can sell into this. And actually, right now, we're already selling into it. We're getting a lot of good orders from hyperscalers either on dark [ph] fiber or lit [ph] and we're going to see that growing. But we have more than that, not just the fiber, it's the power space and cooling, which you know is in really high demand. And we have a lot of latent assets in that area. So at the moment, we're putting it together. We're kind of -- I talked to somebody before, we're going to measure twice and cut once. We're not -- we're figuring out exactly how we're going to go into this market. It's a huge market. We can't cover it all, but there are certain segments we might be better off in than others, and that's -- we'll be back to you pretty soon talking to you about it. It's a great opportunity for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks.\nA \u2013 Brady Connor: Okay. We're going to go over here. We're going to go Brandon, and then Mike Rollins.\nQ \u2013 Brandon Nispel: Thanks. Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. I was hoping you could maybe unpack the fixed wireless targets in the homes passed from the perspective of maybe a proportion of MDUs versus single-family, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 markets and percentage of millimeter wave versus C-Band?\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: That's a lot of unpacking in that one. I'm not sure Joe you want to do it or something. But of course, we -- as I said before, the C-Band deployment goes to suburban and ruling because we started in the urban areas because that's where we got the spectrum first. That's another opportunity. It's a great opportunity, but less density. So I think that's one thing that's happening. The MDU is just adding to coming back to some of the places with dense areas where we can do the MDU solution. So I think it's a combination of them all. I'm not sure it's a special distribution or something if somebody wants to -- we just deploy our technology from a mobility point of view, and then get all the opportunities around it. Again, there's no success based sort of CapEx here for fixed wireless access, which comes along with everything else we're doing. But again, it's a great investment. Mobility is performing better when we have C-Band, both from churn and from step-ups and then we will fixed wireless access. So it makes all the sense for us to deploy it in the right way where we find the revenue, and that's what Joe is doing. Anything else you want to add? Are you sure. Okay. I understand the question, but this is sort of -- we have the framework and our plan of record, how we're deploying this, and it comes along with that. And then both Kyle and Sampath are selling into those open for sale that is coming out from either MDUs or from the C-Band deployment.\nQ \u2013 Mike Rollins: Thanks. Mike Rollins from Citi. I wanted to follow up on this question, but maybe in a different way. So the mobility first is going to take ultra-wideband to 80% to 90% of population and presumably households by end of next year and maybe 90-plus percent over time, but the FWA target is roughly like 60% of homes. What holds that percentage back relative to the 90% plus? And what would be the catalyst to try to unlock that additional 30 points of penetration? And then just a second question, if I could. When you look at building fiber and the team mentioned some of the progress in building and dynamics, what's the base case for penetration and ARPUs from the fiber builds, let's say, over a five-year period?\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: On the first one, I assume my team always want to beat the targets. We give you one target, the team is working to really beat and do it better and faster. You saw what we did last time, we said 4 million to 5 million. We beat that target with 15 months. So I think the team and are building ahead. So, but right now that's a target. It's always a time lag from when you deploy the technology and when you get the revenue and the subscribers. So I guess those are two questions. On the second question, Sampath, I think you can answer on that. You can answer on the first one if you want to correct me.\nA \u2013 Sowmyanarayan Sampath: No, I will not do that today.\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: Okay. Thank you.\nA \u2013 Sowmyanarayan Sampath: Look, on the second, the way you think about first is penetration. Just have been in this business for 20 years. We'll see penetration well north of 40% in our space as we do that space. I think now get more comfort because we'll have more mobility to bear into that space as well. So well north of 40% penetration, we do that. But the second thing we are seeing is every new cohort that we bring in to the market tends to have better one-year penetration than the previous cohort. So it gives us more confidence that -- and you would think when we get to the end of our build, you're getting to the less attractive, but that's not the case. Our first year penetration is actually better this year than it was last year and other. Some has to do with the way we market and the way Joe and my team work together to pre-sell some of that capacity to do that. In terms of ARPU, I know we don't report a specific broadband ARPU number. But look, we tend to do very well. We are industry-leading. If you look at Frontier's ARPU numbers, we'll have continuous growth on top of that because we will -- our customers on broadband sit in the myHome framework, where they come, they buy the connectivity piece. And look, majority of our customers take the 1 gig plus plan coming in. So that gives us a boost in ARPU. And then we start selling perks and other adjacent services on top of that. So we'll see good comfortable ARPU growth with a 1 gig plus plan, ARPU growth on that and the north of 40% penetration pretty much across our fiber footprint as well. Thank you. Next.\nBrady Connor: Okay. Let's go. We're going to go Frank back here in the back row, and then we'll come back up to Tim in the front row over here.\nFrank Louthan: Okay. Great. Frank Louthan with Raymond James. So on the fixed wireless, what is sort of the outlook for that on the business side? Is -- are those 8, 9 -- 8 million, 10 million subs include business, Type 2 replacement, you comment on that? And then getting to 35 million or so homes passed with wireless, is a pretty high percentage. Can you get there without additional M&A? Or does that include BEAD or other government subsidy?\nHans Vestberg: The second one doesn't include any M&A. And besides the one we have planned that you have announced. And B, as Joe said, there's no -- there's small pieces that will not rock the boat. We will make our numbers, regardless or BEAD or not. We will, of course, participate in BEAD that we can do. On the business side, those are in the number 8 to 9, yes, business side is included. And I have to say one of the things that Kyle and I are more surprised than others is, of course, the success we have had on the business side. Maybe you should talk about it on fixed wireless access on the business side, Kyle.\nKyle Malady: Listen, Frank, thanks for question. We continue to see this as a great opportunity, like I said before. We actually did a little bit better with this product than we thought we might. And what's interesting is enterprises, small businesses are figuring out different ways to use this connectivity. It's just not for broadband like you would see in a consumer world. So we think people are going to continue to innovate with it. And so this new -- these new open for sales that Joe and his team are putting together for us, we feel we can accelerate and really sell into this thing. I'm also excited about the -- what you hear about the using millimeter wave for MDU. A lot of these MDUs also have stores or businesses in them. And so we'll be able to leverage that investment as well to increase our market share in this area. So a lot of work to do, but \u2013 but we're really happy with the plans that Joe has put out for us to sell into.\nHans Vestberg: And a good thing from a sort of a utility point of view, many of the customers that Kyle have, they are using the fixed wireless access on certain hours. The consumers are another hour. So this is just using the utility even better that we can sell it in and we can monetize all hours of the day with our network. Next.\nBrady Connor: Come up here to Tim in the front row.\nTim Horan: Thank you. Tim Horan, Oppenheimer. We're seeing pretty unprecedented improvements in technology across the board, satellite, AI, what you're talking about, you would stand alone. Can these be material drivers to the business model, both maybe just talk a little bit about incremental revenue from all of these and maybe the ability to use AI to automate and digitize a lot more. And I guess -- and specifically, you satellite direct to phone, direct to mobile. Can that be a real needle mover in terms of overall growth rates for the company?\nHans Vestberg: I think AI is definitely over a time frame. So how kind and I think about AI, generative AI especially, in the beginning right now, we see large language modules going to the big data centers out to the market all the time. As soon as they're going to be an application that you're going to use as an enterprise, you're going to put it much closer. For the main reason of the transport cost for privacy, for security and in some cases, also latency, maybe not equally much. But then you're going to see a big opportunity for us, given what Kyle talked about. And we will come back a little bit more specific on it, but definitely. But it's going to take some time from all these large language models to be real products and sitting in the edge of the network. So that's clear. Slicing is another area we talked about. We believe that we will probably start more in the business side and then we'll come to the consumer side and that we see as an opportunity as well. On the satellite, a little bit too early to see how large opportunity can be, I have to say, because, of course, we want to offer satellite to our customers in the white spaces, we are not allowed to build, for example, and see a direct device. A little bit too early on the consumer side to see if that's a business case. On the business side, yes, we can see that already for remote enterprise or things like that. So those three are new revenue opportunities on top of everything we've talked about in.\nBrady Connor: Okay. We're doing fine on time. So we're going to get to everybody to just be patient. So we're going to go front row with Walt very here.\nWalt Piecyk: Walt Piecyk from LightShed. So the 2% to 3.5% growth you had historically, there was a lot of doubts whether Sampath is going to deliver on the units. Obviously, it's going to come down in the fourth quarter, but it looks like the Q of the P&Q is happening, just had a price increase, which should accelerate the postpaid growth in the fourth quarter at a time when people are concerned about the economy, right? So you've got -- it seems like some decent strength there. Now you're investing in fiber, you're investing in fixed wireless. Who knows where inflation is, but is the Board now expecting you to deliver higher than this 3% growth? Again, you've got postpaid working. Now you're talking about prepaid, growing, you're making new investments. Shouldn't the expectation be that total wireless number, not 2025 guide, Tony, but like at some point, getting to a -- what is considered -- I mean, T-Mobile is considered a growth company, what are they doing, like 4%, 5% growth, like so delivering that type of growth? That's my first question.\nHans Vestberg: It was a good question, Walter. There was a lot of things to unpack there. But ultimately, you're right on many things we're doing. You're right. We're trying to turn everything right, but we also had some headwinds that with program amortization, for example, that is a headwind for us. So but all in all, our focus is to really do right and do more value for our customers. And I think we are have proven now the last six, seven quarters that we talked about that we can do it. Not going to go into confirming any of your growth numbers or percentages, but we are incentivized to grow our wireless service revenue, that's part of all the teams sitting there and all the V Teamers, they are incentivized to do that.. So of course, our focus is going to be that because we have a leverage model. If we grow, it basically falls down even more to the bottom line, and then we can both improve our cash flow and/or adjusted EBITDA. So all the things you are saying is what we are doing on. I'm not going to commit to any numbers. But clearly, that is to grow faster over time or be sustainable. That's very important for us because that is how we return both cash flow to our shareholders and continue to be an attractive stock to invest in.\nWalt Piecyk: Okay. And then just one quick one because you know I like care about the Apple stuff. I think Tony was very clear on where the current upgrade rates are. But the new narrative is, oh, even though AI sucks now, it's going to be better over the next couple of years. Just kind of your viewpoint on -- because you have to manage cash, right, based on upgrades over the next two years, do you think AI is something that is going to stimulate the upgrade rates within the wireless whether it's Verizon or just broadly in the industry? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: It's a little bit too early to say. I mean many of the AI application, of course, are very helpful. But when it comes to consumer devices, we also need to think about the processing power for this application, if you want to do something really innovative. So I think it's a bit too early to call that. I usually say, historically, when we've seen sort of cycles in our industry that's been 4G to 5G or hardware redesign. Those are the things that have triggered it. Now we're talking about is a software cycle's going to do it. It's too early for us to say at least, we're so far, and I'm looking at my colleagues, we haven't seen that. We haven't seen that is creating the cycle. But it's too early to say we're going to be -- if it's going to happen, we're going to be continued very discipline in how we do promotions. We're going to have the right promotions for the right customers at the right moment in the right segment with the right type of value. So we will continue the work we started somewhere in 2023 with segmenting approach on everything we're doing. Remember, I look at this as a customer sort of investment that we have, all the way from promotions, retention and media. For me that's one bucket, how I drive the market. And that's a tight budget for us, but it's very flexible. As I see Leslie is here in marketing. Sampath is here, Kyle is here. We sit down all the time and see should we put more retention, should we do more on promotion, should we do more on media. That is an ongoing work for us that is dynamic nowadays. Historically has been a little bit more static. But where the market is right now, this is super important to be good at this. And then AI comes in, so you can be even better to see that -- we have -- our customer segment here needs more offerings here. We need to come from here, need more media. We need more retention. All that is a new word where we are in a world where wireless and broadband is such a necessity. Everybody needs to have it. If you're a business or if you're an individual consumer, and we have the best products in both of them. We just need to see that we are creating the value for our customers, and we can go with them upwards. This is something we spent enormous lot of time on because we are getting into a new phase all our industry where I think that I don't think we have ever been as good position as well right now.\nA \u2013 Brady Connor: All right. We're going to go -- well, there's still hands up. Okay. We're going to cut in over here and then cook in, then we're going to come back to Laurent. And we'll finish with Jonathan and John.\nUnidentified Analyst: So maybe, I guess, to start with on fixed wireless. I mean I don't know if this understanding is correct, but it feels like the approach or the go-to-market strategy is mutually exclusive between fiber and fixed wireless in the sense that I don't think that's the approach some of your peers are taking where fixed wireless is top of the funnel, you upgrade people to fiber and it becomes a different path. For you it seems like a TAM opportunity where you expand the market. So first, I want to get an understanding of whether that's the go-to-market approach?\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: Yeah. We can confirm that one. Yeah, that is it. I mean we want to create optionality and that's how we build the networks. Different customers want fiber or Fios and others want fixed wireless access. We want to want to create that opportunity. I don't miss out on any of the segments because they like one product and the other. We are trying to address both of them. That's what the plan you see here.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then from a capital allocation perspective, I mean, when you think about your peers, they're obviously using a slightly different approach when it comes to investing in fiber with JVs and maybe more localized kind of an approach in different parts of the country using these JVs. And you followed a more of an on-balance sheet approach. Is that an option you have in the future to look at some of these structures? Or is this something that that you've made a deliberate choice on this is--?\nHans Vestberg: No, it's not a deliberate choice. It is -- we look into everything and it's an option, but again, it has to be a good return on investment. So far, we haven't found any third-party models where we don't own the capital and somebody else own the capital that is really attractive with our return on capital because we have one of the best into return on capital in the industry and we want to see that, that continues. So far, it has been organic. We're doing it. But -- nothing is excluded here. I mean, I usually say that the CEO, you can never say that are never going to do it and then suddenly you do it, then everybody say you told us not. But -- so I couldn't exclude it, but so far, we haven't found any of those models that we think is attractive in our capital allocation and our return to our shareholders.\nBrady Connor: We'll go to [indiscernible] next.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. [indiscernible] with Evercore ISI. Maybe for Sampath, I had a question about your perks portfolio. And the 7 million subscriptions, you mentioned is pretty impressive, fairly ambitious targets to double that going forward. Are you happy with the portfolio now? Do you see that changing? And as you expand that, does your relationship wholesale partnerships, does that dynamic change in your economics evolve, especially with entertainment partners that you have?\nSowmyanarayan Sampath: I think when we started launching myPlan, our sales teams were getting used to this. It was selling motion. Our customers are also getting used to it. So, if you look at our attach rate, it has grown significantly from when we launched at the beginning of the year, again, beginning of the year to where we are now, teams are getting more comfortable than that. So, that's why we get to 7 million. We'll double that at $10 a pop, you can do the math on where it goes. What we tend to find is the perks that do well for us are ones that are exclusive to us, ones that have maximum savings and then one just have a very strong value prop for the customer. So, you'll not see us have a very long tail on that. Because what it does is it doesn't focus the attention of the sales teams and our digital efforts to do that. So, we'll continue with our approach of having fewer, deeper relationships like right now, we have deep relations with Apple, with Disney, with Netflix, with MAX, some of our own perks as well. And also, it has to be margin accretive to us as well. We've been quite open about this. This is a margin play as much as it's a revenue play for us. So, fewer, more concentrated perks makes a lot more sense. And that if it kind of answers your second part of the question, we tend to have more leverage over our partners and that drives better economics for us in the process. But we're really excited about getting to double this perk portfolio with a pretty margin-rich pool that we have right now.\nHans Vestberg: And then adding also Sampath some of the combinations, we are unique. We're the only one who can do those combinations that we have had, for example, MAX and Netflix in the market. Nobody can combine that. That's how we have negotiated, so we have this flexibility and exclusivity to do it, and that is what is driving quite a lot of things. And all-in-all, every perk we have is a saving for you, for our customer. And of course, it's also a saving for our partners because ultimately, they're wholesaling to us, they don't have the cost of acquisition. But again, we only do it when we -- it's accretive for us as well. Has to be accretive for the customer, has to be accretive to us. And then we go forward and creating a very unique model. And sometimes, you might think this is pretty simple. But I'm looking at Shankar, with this our head of IT. Just imagine you can come into the store and actually be a Netflix customer and move over to be a Netflix customer to Verizon. We take care of all of that back end. The only thing you need to remember is your password. And sometimes that might be a problem, I know. But so just imagine how much work we have done to make this a unique offering that is hard to replicate, first of all, some of them are exclusive. And number two, you need to replicate a lot of things behind because if you're going to go home and then you log off and then you log on and cancel and everything. I can tell you the heat rate is low. Extremely low. And that's why we have worked so much with the customer experience here to do this in the right way. And I think that Sampath and Leslie and Shankar and the whole team have thought about how we make it simple for our customers. So I think this is just the beginning of us using the distribution as a strategy. We have the network. We have the distribution. We're just going to continue to do the right thing for our customers here, and that's going to pay off long term for us.\nBrady Connor: All right. So the clock is ticking down. We have time for one more. We're going to go Laurent here in the back.\nLaurent Yoon: Sorry, Sampath one more question for you. This is Laurent Yoon from Bernstein. You mentioned the 500 basis point incremental penetration of wireless and where you have fiber. Can you give us some color on correlation versus causation for that number? And secondly, how important is that observation or more explicitly. Is any of that the expectation of incremental wireless built into your fiber business case going to 35 million to 40 million passes?\nSowmyanarayan Sampath: Yes. Let me answer the second part first. Look, we feel comfortable between Joe, Tony and I on this 35% to 40%. Fiber economics is getting better over time. Two reasons. The first one is cost, as Joe said, we're getting better on technology, better systems, able to take cost out of the process. Second is penetration. A, north of 40% penetration, but also how quickly we get to that north of 40%. That's another important factor. Another important factor, Laurent, is the first year of penetration. How quickly we get to first year penetration. And as I said, we keep getting better every year on how quickly we get to year one penetration in that. So those are some of the factors that make fiber really attractive. On top that, now you have mobile plus home benefits that historically, we've not had or not spent enough time on. So that's kind of cherry on top of the whole Sunday in terms of why fiber economics looks really strong going forward to do that. To answer your first part of the question, if we see 500 basis points or 5% better wireless market share in Tier 1 large Tier 1 markets where we have fiber. Look, I think there is, a lot of it is driven by causation, because you have better brand, we're able to spend more money on marketing in those local markets. Two is also distribution. Historically, we've not had our stores get involved in Fios sale. Now we have a sales motion where all stores, especially in the Northeast, get more involved in the Fios sale. You saw that this quarter, we actually launched it this quarter when we do that. So better marketing, we're able to double down efforts but also you tend to get the cross-sell opportunity in that. So I think a lot of it is causation going forward. So there will be upside in our mobility case as we continue to get to 35 million to 40 million homes of fiber definitely.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I guess we are wrapping up. First of all, thank you, everyone on the webcast, everyone coming here face-to-face in New York. Hopefully, you've got more insights, both to our third quarter, but also to our expanded broadband strategy, and for sure, we will back with more information as we have more quarters to come and other activities. So once again, thank you so much, guys, for coming. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sowmyanarayan Sampath",
            "content": "Joe, thank you. Very good morning to all of you. There are two things that Joe spoke about that really excites me. The first one is America's best wireless network continues to get bigger and even better. And the second one is our ability to offer broadband to 100 million homes and businesses over a period of time. So with that, let me get into how we go about this. Verizon is in a very unique position right now because we have two engines of growth: mobility and broadband. Both these segments, both these businesses have secular tailwinds, there's huge demand for both of the products. And more importantly, Verizon has a good position and a lot of opportunity to grow in front of it. Let's start with mobility. Look, in mobility, we are number one. If we look at our share position, our total revenue. And it starts with our postpaid business. We are seeing continued momentum in our postpaid business. With this quarter, we would have had seven quarters of consecutive year-on-year postpaid phone gross ad momentum that we have in the business. And why did that happen? Some of it has to do with our sales engine that we've gone and reengineered, get back to the local market structure, local sales incentives, local marketing. And the second is myPlan. myPlan, as I say, is on plan. Customers love it. They like the structure of it, they like the ability to get access to unique offerings and it's truly differentiated in the market. And you saw us, we had a strong quarter, 81,000 phone net adds in the space. We will be postpaid phone net add positive with second number, without second number, this year as well as promised in our plan to do that. Next, we turn our attention to our value business or prepaid. And we bought TracFone, we've integrated TracFone and we had really strong momentum in our business. We had 80,000 net add positive in our business, the best in many quarters, and a lot of that comes down to a core performance of our brands. We saw almost all our brands have very strong performance and momentum in this space. Two, our exclusive distribution with total wireless has scaled up really well, and you can see those stores everywhere. And third is our unique distribution position that we have within Walmart. And you're going to see continued progress and continued momentum in our value business going forward. That brings me to our third topic, which is churn. Now that we have our postpaid engine working well, our value turnaround in progress, I can turn my attention to the churn. There is nothing structurally that prevents Verizon from being an industry leader in retention and lower churn. We've been in that position before. We know how it feels. And more importantly, we know how we get there. In the short-term, we made some trade-offs, some strategic trade-offs that Hans and I feel very good about to drive shareholder value. We had some pricing actions that do drive some churn in this space. But on balance, we feel very good about how we executed those and often churn is way less than some of our business cases that had come in. The second is we are very disciplined about our retention spend. You see that in our upgrade numbers. We -- it has to be demand-led, customers have to want it, and we link our retention promotions the plans and the price plans that they have there. But over a period of time, you should expect lower churn from us from a couple of things. The first one is better experience. We are using AI significantly both at stores at our call centers. Second is myPlan and perks, as more and more and of our base gets into the myPlan construct and takes more perks that helps with churn. Third is myAccess or Verizon Access, our loyalty program, which I'll cover in a bit, that could give us traction in that. And then the last one, which is probably the biggest lever is going to be more mobile plus home customers. When those two customers come together, we see a huge reduction in churn, and that's going to apply to a larger base as we expand our broadband offering more piece. The fourth is margin accretive add-on services. In form of perks, in form of adjacent services, it's a continuous growth, and it's being very innovative every time we do that. We are taking the same approach we have to mobility to our broadband space. It first starts with momentum in sales. You saw that this quarter strong momentum in sales on Fios and FWA. Similar tactics, similar promotions. But the construct is that same momentum we have and the same energy we bring to our broadband business as well. myHome has been a very successful launch. A lot of our base tends to like the perks. They are taking on our new customers when they come on board, they take on perks, and they like the ability to share their perks between mobile and home. And also sustained growth in ARPU, when you build a long-term sustainable subscription business like we've done, you have to balance P&Q. Over a period of time, I've spoken about this 80-20 contribution to service revenue because that's the big measure we measure ourselves on is service revenue. I think with a positive four net add trajectory, strong FWA and Fios performance, we are on track to get to that 80-20 mix over a period of time. Now, we are in a very unique position. I think the only the only company, carrier, who has a scaled position in both FWA and in the fiber business. And both these are top products, when you combine them together you get access to 100 million homes and businesses in the country. No other carrier offers that amount of coverage and depth that we offer in terms of serving our customers. Let's dig into each of these one by one. The first is FWA. Joe just spoke about moving from 60 million to 90 million homes and businesses covered. But what's interesting about the FWA basis, it's a quality prime customer base. Our FICO score on FWA is north of 700. So it's a really strong customer base. And the reason is it's a high price value equation. There's a huge segment of the market who love that. And because of that, you see very high NPS scores. I mean think about it, you could finish this. You could go to a store in five minutes, buy it, and in 10 minutes after that, you could be in your apartment connected with the 5G Verizon FWA product. It's a huge competitive advantage. High NPS is a competitive advantage. Our pricing construct is a competitive advantage. We do not like promotions that roll off. You get a customer on one price point and in two years, you -- the price changes. It's annoys customer. And that's one of the reasons why it's a huge competitive advantage for us because we continue to lead with that. And then you have fiber. Joe spoke about 20 years. He's been working a little longer than 20 years in the fiber business. Look, we are the OG fiber players. Some people think it's a new thing. We've been in this thing for 20-plus years. And every year, we find that the new cohorts that we bring on have better penetration than some of our older cohorts even because we get better. Joe gets better with the build, we get better with selling it, we're targeting it, using digital to bear in those pieces to do that. But what's interesting is it's a white-glove experience. Very, very high NPS scores that we have, very low churn. And most, a majority of our customers who come and take our Gig Plus plan. Again, that's a competitive advantage around high NPS, high customer satisfaction. So over a period of time with 100 million premises covered, we have a differentiated offering. We have an offering that is steered. We have an offer that is segmented. FWA and fiber, and customers will choose. At the end of the day, we want customers to choose what's right for them, and we're going to be very transparent on what the pricing is and what the value prop is to grow that. And talking of value prop, I want to spend some time talking about the Verizon model of convergence. The Verizon model of convergence is margin accretive. It is revenue accretive and has very attractive ROIC. And at the end of the day, it is demand led. I do not believe in giving away one product to sell the other, or giving away one product to hold on to the other. We think we have the best wireless network. We have best broadband offering. Customers want it and they're willing to pay a very fair price for it. We do have some advantages for a customer when they take both of those products together. But at the end of the day, it is demand-led, because customers want to buy the best from both us to do that. Now let me talk a little bit about how this convergence comes to life. How convergence comes to life? The first one, as you see on the page, is myHome and myPlan. It's -- we launched both, and it's not a coincidence that both the offerings look very similar. You buy a base connectivity and then you have access to these really unique books. I mean, it's becoming a pretty big business for us and customers can share perks across both those plans. The second is our app. My Verizon app, we have a single app now for both for mobility and home. So once you get a mobility customer, they see a home piece and they can try out the home and they can buy the home and then vice versa to do that. And also home Wi-Fi can control everything in a single app and it does very well. The third thing is transparent pricing. It is very clear to customers what their savings are. And we're going to keep innovating in this space. Because at the end of the day, customers want the best product, but they also want clear pricing upfront, and we do that every single time with our constructs that we have there. Fourth is distribution. We have a large distribution of stores and a digital footprint. And you can see over a period of time, we are able to distribute our Fios offering through our store network as well, and that's a huge upside to the business case. So you see that we are building the Verizon model of convergence, which is demand-led and it's accretive to us. But where does the value come for Verizon and its shareholders? Two big buckets, revenue. The first one is we will see penetration well north of 40% in our business. And as I said, every new cohort that we bring in actually gets to that a little faster than the previous cohort we do that space. And once we do that, once we acquire Frontier, and when we close on Frontier, we will we will have that as well. And then as Joe builds out new networks, we will see similar penetration levels as we do that. The second is, in some of our big markets where we have fiber, our wireless market share is 500 basis points or 5% better than if we don't have fiber. So we can cross-sell mobility to our Frontier base when we close it, to our new cohorts of fiber that are coming in, but also customers who have access to fiber, but don't have fiber today, we'll be able to cross-sell them. So two revenue upside opportunity for us as we build out our converged offering. The second is churn. A couple of data points. We see a 50% reduction in mobility churn when we bundle with fiber. And that's a huge lever for us, even broader, longer term on how we take churn down in the space. The second is a fiber churn, which is already world-class, one of the best in the world, will go down another 40% when we bundle mobility and fiber. That's a very unique position for us, and we see churn benefits on FWA as well. So what we are essentially building here is one of the world's best franchises for broadband, with FWA as well as with fiber, with best-in-class metrics. But more importantly, it's demand-led, and that's the Verizon model of convergence. Talking about demand led, a lot of the reason it's demand-led actually comes from our unique value prop. Let me start with this. The bottom of layer is our connectivity layer. Best network. Joe always says, we will be the most reliable network. That's where our value comes from. It's the same network we have for broadband, for postpaid, through myPlan and our prepaid value brands as well. And we keep tiering these. We have segments that go after it. And over a period of time, we'll have new sources of revenue. Let me touch on two of these. The first is network slicing. It's a new currency. It's something that you should -- we should talk a little more about soon. And that will have upside opportunity for us. Second is satellite connectivity. That's another new form of connectivity and then new ways to monetize our overall connectivity network. Then on top of that, you get to our entertainment and adjacent services. We call them perks, because you have to be a Verizon customer to get them. That's the perk you get for being a Verizon customer. And we right now have seven million perk subscriptions on our network. And then guess what, they're going to double by 2025. So we have a large revenue stream that customers find very compelling. It reduces churn for us and is very margin rich for us. So it covers a lot of pieces for us. And we're not stopping still. We're going to keep innovating. But to be on our network to be part of perks, it's going to have to be compelling. It's going to have to be exclusive to Verizon and something our customers want and they can save money with it. On top, we have our loyalty program. Verizon Access or if you're a customer, it's just myAccess because it's your access, because it gives you access to two things. One is always on deals to some of the best premium brands out there. But second is once in a lifetime, my kids call it bucket list type opportunities they have. For example, you can sky dive with the bronchos, or you can go to London to watch the Jacksonville Jaguars. Or we can actually toss the kind for the opening game. These are once-in-a-lifetime events for NFL, NHL, NBA and some of the best musical acts out there. I don't know if you can get tickets for Taylor Swift, but definitely check in on the Verizon myAccess plan to do that. As I wrap up, I want to leave you with two thoughts. The first is we at Verizon right now, have two engines for growth. Two engines that have secular growth in front of them, two engines that have tailwinds and where we have unique market position but huge opportunity as well. You're going to see us do the Verizon model of convergence, which is demand-led, which is give customers choice, be transparent about pricing and offer them a huge set of services on top of that. We're going to deepen our relationship with our customers and extract value for them and for ourselves in the process. The second is, over the last seven quarters, you've seen our vision and execution on the business. You're going to give a lot of confidence you're going to get from that that we will execute on that for our mobility business, our broadband business and the Verizon converged business. With that, I'm going to pass it over to Tony talk about two things; 3Q update and more importantly, capital allocation. Tony take it away. Yeah. Look, I think it comes back -- we've had seven quarters of strong gross add year-on-year growth coming into this. And all the efforts that we've put in, whether it's local marketing, going back to market structure, sales incentive, myPlan, just better execution on the ground, we continue to see gross add improvement in our business going forward. So I think that's a machine that we've gotten back to the right phase, and you're to see continued growth in that. The second comes down to churn. As I mentioned, there's nothing structurally that prevents us from getting back to leadership position on customer retention and churn. We made some short-term strategic trade-offs, which are the right things to do. But over a period of time, churn will start coming down, mobile plus home offerings, converged offerings is probably the biggest lever that we have there. But then myPlan, some of our loyalty programs and then just better execution on the churn piece as well. So you're going to see both things coming in, continued progression on gross add momentum and then better churn. When you put both of them together, that's how we're going to sustain a net add growth over period of time to do that. The second is on the price side. Look, we've had four or five price increases depending on how you count it over the last years. And in every case, the churn has been less than what we thought coming in. So customers like our product, they our offering, and you're going to see continued ways in which we can earn the trust of customer. The last one is there is another type of price increase, which has earned price increase. If you look at the chart where I had the customer offering framework, we are able to upsell our customers, upsell them on the type of plans, but also upsell them on perks and other things. We have seven million perks in our business right now. That's going to double this time next year. So you're going to see a lot of momentum on the price side just by our ability to earn those price-ups that we have. So a combination of gross adds, better churn and also ability to upsell our customer both on connectivity and some of the other offerings that we have. When you put all of that in, I get really comfortable about the LG20 [ph] framework that we laid out, that we are going on the right path to get there. I think when we started launching myPlan, our sales teams were getting used to this. It was selling motion. Our customers are also getting used to it. So, if you look at our attach rate, it has grown significantly from when we launched at the beginning of the year, again, beginning of the year to where we are now, teams are getting more comfortable than that. So, that's why we get to 7 million. We'll double that at $10 a pop, you can do the math on where it goes. What we tend to find is the perks that do well for us are ones that are exclusive to us, ones that have maximum savings and then one just have a very strong value prop for the customer. So, you'll not see us have a very long tail on that. Because what it does is it doesn't focus the attention of the sales teams and our digital efforts to do that. So, we'll continue with our approach of having fewer, deeper relationships like right now, we have deep relations with Apple, with Disney, with Netflix, with MAX, some of our own perks as well. And also, it has to be margin accretive to us as well. We've been quite open about this. This is a margin play as much as it's a revenue play for us. So, fewer, more concentrated perks makes a lot more sense. And that if it kind of answers your second part of the question, we tend to have more leverage over our partners and that drives better economics for us in the process. But we're really excited about getting to double this perk portfolio with a pretty margin-rich pool that we have right now. Yes. Let me answer the second part first. Look, we feel comfortable between Joe, Tony and I on this 35% to 40%. Fiber economics is getting better over time. Two reasons. The first one is cost, as Joe said, we're getting better on technology, better systems, able to take cost out of the process. Second is penetration. A, north of 40% penetration, but also how quickly we get to that north of 40%. That's another important factor. Another important factor, Laurent, is the first year of penetration. How quickly we get to first year penetration. And as I said, we keep getting better every year on how quickly we get to year one penetration in that. So those are some of the factors that make fiber really attractive. On top that, now you have mobile plus home benefits that historically, we've not had or not spent enough time on. So that's kind of cherry on top of the whole Sunday in terms of why fiber economics looks really strong going forward to do that. To answer your first part of the question, if we see 500 basis points or 5% better wireless market share in Tier 1 large Tier 1 markets where we have fiber. Look, I think there is, a lot of it is driven by causation, because you have better brand, we're able to spend more money on marketing in those local markets. Two is also distribution. Historically, we've not had our stores get involved in Fios sale. Now we have a sales motion where all stores, especially in the Northeast, get more involved in the Fios sale. You saw that this quarter, we actually launched it this quarter when we do that. So better marketing, we're able to double down efforts but also you tend to get the cross-sell opportunity in that. So I think a lot of it is causation going forward. So there will be upside in our mobility case as we continue to get to 35 million to 40 million homes of fiber definitely."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Joe Russo",
            "content": "Thank you, Hans. Appreciate it very much. Good morning everybody. The one thing I want to first say upfront is the is the network and technology team super confident that investments I'm going to talk about over the next few slides, coupled with the best engineers in the industry, is going to continue to deliver on the best, most reliable, highest performing networks for our customers and give that experience to more and more Americans across the country. It's easy to make claims about being the largest this or the fastest that, but that's not what my team and I are about. We're about building the best, most reliable networks. And that takes hard work and a lot of strategic investments that I'll talk a little bit about today. But that's hard work around testing and optimizing the network each and every day. It's strategic investments in things like generators and mobile assets for when there's emergencies. And this is why, as Hans said, following the Hurricanes Helena and Milton, the Verizon network outperformed rest of the industry, and I'm super proud that we were there when our customers and first-responders and businesses needed us the most. So, before I dive into the broadband plans, I first want to congratulate Kyle and Sampath for hitting our 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access target 15 months ahead of schedule. And that took a ton of work from a lot of people within the organization. But one of the things I'm very proud of from the network and technology team is that we built the coverage and capacity well ahead of schedule for them to deliver on that target. And as we look forward to the -- here we go. As we look forward to this new doubling of our fixed wireless access subscribers, my team's objective hasn't changed. It's to build the coverage and capacity well ahead of schedule and we're already doing that. We expect that to cover another 30 million homes over the next four years on our award-winning multipurpose network, we have to do a few things. The first is will take a mobility-first approach, and I'll talk more about that in a minute. But getting to 90 million homes and businesses covered with fixed wireless access will be accomplished with three key things we're doing today. The first is our aggressive deployment of C-Band and millimeter wave, we call ultra wideband. The second is a new MDU solution that's been in trial and we'll be rolling out in 2025 to serve MDUs with up to 1 gig Internet service with our millimeter wave technology. And the third is technology advances and the use of our vast small cell network in order to add even more ultra wideband coverage and capacity between now and 2028. So I'm going to shift gears a little bit to fiber. So I'm looking forward to the pending acquisition of Frontier and bringing these two great fiber assets together. The combined wireline footprint has approximately 48 million homes and businesses of which 25 million of those are already served with fiber. And I know one thing. With our 20-year experience in building fiber across this country, that we will continue to deploy Fios in the new footprint after closing. Post close, we will take the appropriate pace to build based on the following criteria. The first is the profitability of the build. The second is the competitive environment that we see that we're operating in. And the third is our capital allocation priorities. But over time, I want to be clear. My objective is to bring Fios to 35 million to 40 million homes across the country. So I want to bring the whole network strategy together for you. The first is, we built a shared multipurpose network with owners' economics to serve as many profitable connections as possible. That strategy is built on the foundation we call the Intelligent Edge Network, which is rooted in our rich fiber assets, both in the ultra long-haul network and in the metro networks across the country. It also encompasses our converged IP core and our own and operated Verizon Cloud platform and our mobile edge computing platform that serves both today's and tomorrow's technologies. This foundation gives my team and I the capability to provide that best, most reliable, highest performing network to two access technologies. The first is the radio access network. And again, as I mentioned, we take a mobility-first approach. What that means is I deploy coverage and capacity to enhance the mobile experience for our customers and to find new revenue streams. The good news is we pull through fixed wireless access when we do that. And as we've said, we've been awfully successful in that space. Customers just love that product. So we will be accelerating our ultra wideband deployment. I expect that by the end of this year, we'll have a -- we'll have covered 70% of our planned footprint and by the end of next year through acceleration, we will get to 80% to 90% of that planned footprint covered. We also have just recently launched our 100% virtualized 5G core network with stand-alone and slicing capabilities. And we'll talk a little bit more towards the end of this year, how we're going to put those to use in the market. And then finally, we are the only company in this country that's actually running virtualized RAN at scale. 40% of my C-Band sites are now virtualized in the network. Shifting over to fiber access network. So I've been building Fios for 20 years or so now. And we're on track this year to pass approximately 500,000 prems. Frontier, as you know, is on their way to pass 10 million prems by the end of 2026. And we are in 2025, targeting an expansion of our Fios build up to 650,000 prems. Post-close, I see that pace growing to up to 1 million plus prems per year. But what excites me more than anything, after 20 years of doing this, is our business case on Fios is getting better and better. And that starts with the fact that customers demand high-quality broadband services more now than ever. So what we see is when I do a build today, we see higher and faster penetration rates than we have with prior builds. And we pulled through mobility benefits on both churn and ARPU. But I'm also finding new and creative ways to bring down the cost of deploying fiber. And that comes in three big chunks. The first is partnerships with companies like Corning and CommScope, where they're delivering technology to do both reduction in the amount of fiber I have to deploy to serve homes and the techniques and technologies that make it easier for my team to deploy. The second is, we've made with Sean Carr's [ph] help, 20 years of systems and tools improvements through the whole process of building, designing, operating the network and we're seeing great benefits from those systems and tools enhancements in the reduction of rework, efficiency of our build and operating of the network. And then the third is, we've made some strategic decisions of how to get legacy costs out of our network without having to deploy fiber to the entire wire center. So I can use other techniques to move customers to new technologies and remove legacy equipment without having to deploy fiber across an entire footprint. But our network strategy is clear. To build and operate the best, most reliable, highest performing network to power and empower how our customers live, work and play. Let me leave you with this. My goal is to ensure more and more Americans have access to that best, most reliable network experience, by expanding the best mobile and broadband networks through a disciplined capital approach. We do that by building the best networks. And over time, that includes a 5G ultra-wideband network that will serve 300-plus million Americans with 5G advanced features for today's and tomorrow's technology. And a fixed wireless access and Fios network that will serve over a 100 million homes and businesses. So I'm going to turn it over now to Sampath, who will talk through how he'll ensure more customers get access to those great network experiences. Thanks, Sampath. Okay. Yeah. Just on BEAD. So we've built a very good process for managing subsidies. And we've been already receiving and winning subsidies in our Fios footprint. So as BEAD starts to get deployed, we'll deploy those same kind of standards and processes to participate. When I think about the 35 million to 40 million, it will be a very, very small percent that we think is BEAD. And we foresee that getting 35 million to 40 million will be with or without BEAD funding. I'll just add on small cells, and I mentioned it during, but we started probably about six months ago now deploying C-Band on small cells and have seen really good success with putting that technology on our vast small cell network, giving us more coverage and certainly more capacity for both mobile and fixed wireless access. So my view is that will continue in this four-year build program. As we'll leverage what we've done both with our millimeter wave small cells, and we had a pretty significant small cell network even for the 4G network. Leveraging now C-Band on those has really proven to be a great tool to add coverage and capacity."

And actually, right now, we're already selling into it. We're getting a lot of good orders from hyperscalers either on dark [ph] fiber or lit [ph] and we're going to see that growing. But we have more than that, not just the fiber, it's the power space and cooling, which you know is in really high demand. And we have a lot of latent assets in that area. So at the moment, we're putting it together. We're kind of -- I talked to somebody before, we're going to measure twice and cut once. We're not -- we're figuring out exactly how we're going to go into this market. It's a huge market. We can't cover it all, but there are certain segments we might be better off in than others, and that's -- we'll be back to you pretty soon talking to you about it. It's a great opportunity for us. Listen, Frank, thanks for question. We continue to see this as a great opportunity, like I said before. We actually did a little bit better with this product than we thought we might. And what's interesting is enterprises, small businesses are figuring out different ways to use this connectivity. It's just not for broadband like you would see in a consumer world. So we think people are going to continue to innovate with it. And so this new -- these new open for sales that Joe and his team are putting together for us, we feel we can accelerate and really sell into this thing. I'm also excited about the -- what you hear about the using millimeter wave for MDU. A lot of these MDUs also have stores or businesses in them. And so we'll be able to leverage that investment as well to increase our market share in this area. So a lot of work to do, but \u2013 but we're really happy with the plans that Joe has put out for us to sell into."

            "content": "Good morning. And welcome to Verizon Third Quarter Earnings Call as well as a Broadband Update. Very happy to see so many in the room, but of course, also happy for everyone joining on the webcast. Let me kick this off. I'm going to -- we have an agenda that is pretty simple. I'm going to talk about the highlights of the third quarter, then we're going to do some -- a little bit of strategic updates and we're going to end up with Tony talking about the results and capital allocation. So, let me start by talking about the third quarter. And maybe before I start with the third quarter, just mentioning the hurricanes that has been going through our southern part of country and had devastating impacts. Verizon, of course, has worked tirelessly to see that our communications up, is so essential that communication is working for public safety, but also for the communities that are affected. Initially, in some of the states, we had challenges, especially with power, but I think that our team did a fantastic job to get our networks up pretty quickly. So, again, this is things that are happening constantly around the world right now in hurricanes and natural disasters. For us, building the networks, as we are always doing, is extremely important to see the resilience and on the network during this time. So, starting with that, talking a little bit about the results. I have a tie today. That means it's a good a good result. It is result. I'm really pleased with what I've seen them. I've talked to you so many times that there are years when you are a CEO where you're performing better than others. And I know that 2023 wasn't the highlight of my career at Verizon, [indiscernible] what we have done great job since then. Started in 2023 in the midyear of starting changing the products and all of that and then coming around where we are right now. Looking at the financial, growing 2.7% in the wireless service revenue is great. I'm also proud to report the biggest profit EBITDA in the history of Verizon, $12.5 billion in the quarter, which is really good and its multi-factors. And of course, the team sitting over there have done a great job. Proud of that. We continue to create good cash flow, $6 billion in the quarter, continue with a really strong cash flow generation as that is part of our measurement and how we measure ourselves. On the operational side, we started getting an even better balance on the postpaid side. We were 239,000 net adds positive. Sampath will talk about what happened in the consumer, but I already now going to tell him, he did a great job in the postpaid, but also in the prepaid. We were turnaround prepaid. We got a lot of questions over the years. Now we're around approximately 80,000 ex SafeLink. And of course, the business side did a great job on wireless again. Kyle and his team is consistently between 125,000 to 150,000 net adds every quarter, and I'm really pleased with that. The broadband side, I promised you now for quite a long time. As soon as I get into 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers, are going to come back to what we're going to do after that for slides down. I will talk about that. But first of all, I'm going to take a victory lap that we're 15 months ahead of the target we outlined when we bought the C-band with our fixed wireless access. Again, a great product, great work. At the same time, for the ones that remember, we were a little bit weaker on Fios in the second quarter because there was a little bit of movements in the market with ACP and all of that. Now we're back to normal again. The team is doing great work with Fios. All-in-all, a great quarter for broadband. And we continue with the private networks and the mobile edge compute. We announced two deals this quarter, but we had way more. FIFA and MSG, Madison Square Garden Group, all are buying private networks using our capabilities in dense areas to see that they can fulfill their fans or the customers' experiences. All-in-all, we feel good about the full year financial guidance that we gave earlier in the year. We even said, if you have read the press release, which I hope that all of you have done, that when it comes to the wireless service revenue and EBITDA, we are at midpoint or above on both of them for the full year. That's how good we feel about the performance so far in the year. That's what I have to say about the third quarter. Tony will come back and go a little bit deeper. If I then come in to talk a bit about the strategy. Some of this is given for you, for me, it's a journey where we are today. It's a long journey with a lot of things, and we are very organized structure company, what we're doing. The first phase, I call it sort of building the foundation. Some of you remember the heavy investment in fiber, the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, all of that was enormously important for today's work. I mean on the table in front of you have your consumer connection report. That's what we give out twice a year with all the stats what's happening in the network. Last time, we told you that our network, the last five years, grew 129%. If you haven't built it with our own fiber with the transport networks we have done and all these fundamentals that Kyle and Joe has built, we can't handle all these data and have the best network in the nation when it comes to wireless and broadband. So the fundamentals we did with go-to-market, with consumer and business is really paying off today. And you see it when our product has started resonating with the market is because we have Kyle and we have Sampath, both of them thinking about how to meet the customer demands and what the customer needs to have. So all-in-all, that was important. The second phase, all of you remember, we sold -- we bought a lot of assets. We sold everything in Verizon Media Group. We bought the TracFone that is paying off right now. We also bought the C-Band, enormously important you're going to hear Joe talking about the C-Band, but we all know where we deploy this C-Band, we have a great financial success and customer impact. So very important movements we did in that. But we also launched a lot of new products, fixed wireless access, myPlan, myHome and a lot of other things that we now have as the base going into 2025. And now we're also extending our TAM with a couple of larger investments we're doing all the way from Frontier, but also what we want to talk to in a second. So for me, this journey is now in a moment where we have the have the right assets. We have right the right team, and we have great products for our customers. Only the last, I would say, six months, we have done all of these strategic movements in order to strengthen ourselves to continue to be clearly the number one in the market and extending that. You have seen them all, the customer-first offerings we have done, resonating with our customer. We're going to hear Sampath talk about them. The refreshed brand we did in June, that takes time to get the impact, but we see the positive movement with a refreshed brand that is supporting our new products, really happy with that. And hopefully, some of you are looking at commercials, highly digitally, or on TV, and see how we're trying to recapture and rethinking the way we're showing up for our customers. We have the plan, Frontier acquisition. We talked about that in a separate session. We're excited about that and adding to our expanded TAM. We did a tower transaction just two seconds on that. Of course, this was cash in. But more importantly, we only do the deal when we can see a deal that's actually creating more \u2013 more opportunity for us, both by having a cost level that is predictable for us, very important. I like [Indiscernible] economics in the network; and second, also creating more competition in the market. We are suddenly creating with a strategic partner in Vertical Bridge, another strong partner in the market, giving more optionality and seeing that we can have a predictable cost for our tower leases, which is one of the few things we're not having 100% ownership on. We also yesterday, I think, announced that we're buying some spectrum US Cellular. It's going to take time until that's come into fruition because it's hanging on another acquisition. So I don't think it's going to be cash out until 2026. It's just adding capacity. It's a buy versus build in that region. So we're adding capacity there. And then we will not speak so much about AI today, but I hope you're going to add some questions to Kyle, because not only even efficiencies that Sampath is talking about in the customer care and personalization, we see with our compute storage, with our power and the mobile edge compute, we see great opportunities when it comes to AI and revenues for us. And we will talk a little bit about here, but we also do it in the future, coming back a little bit more structure and talk what we're doing. But we already right now see a good tractions on what we're doing on the front end of it. All in all, that's sums it up where we are today. I think we have an unmatched value proposition all the way from our best mobility, American's best mobile networks. We created a satellite partnership recently. We have myPlan, plus all the business and business offerings, strong offering. And then on the broadband side, all the way from Fios to fixed wireless access, we're now almost 12 million broadband customers, 11.9. The fixed wireless access are generating more than $550 million per quarter in revenue started three years ago. So we can see that we can build on this network, where we build the network once and we want as many profitable connections on top of it. It started paying off without. So we're uniquely positioned in the market with onerous economics. So all that said, we're already in the quarter, where are we going as a company? We know also that we hit sort of our targets on broadband. So we're going to talk today about what we're doing next. So our broadband targets going forward is basically going to say that we're going to double the fixed wireless access targets by 2028 to 8 million, 9 million fixed wireless access subscribers. Joe will talk a little bit what we're doing and how we continue, and I expect that Joe, our Head of Network continue to have capacity way beyond and continue to build for us so we are ready to capture this opportunity that were created. We also want to talk about our acceleration on Fios. We think that's a great opportunity for us to do that in this moment. We will, as we have closed the Frontier acquisition, have more than 30 million passings -- fiber passing. And we also see a clear path of somewhat to 35 million to 40 million passings after Frontier and what we're doing ourselves. And if you combine that with our fixed wireless access, I think in the future, we're going to cover more than 100 million households. So, clearly, the broadband, together with the mobility, together with our offerings, we are putting ourselves up to a possibility to continue to have sustainable growth on our service revenue, but also continue to expand our EBITDA and cash flow. And the ones that have been following us for time, you know those three all the things were measured on. Those are the three things that management are measured on. The Board has decided those are the three things that are actually driving the most shareholder value. And that's what we're focused on here right now. So, I will let my team now explain a little bit about where we are and how we're going to execute on these targets. And then we're going to hear Sampath and Tony talk about the financials and the situation. So by that, I'm going to hand over to Joe Russo. Thank you, Tony. Let me summarize updates before we come to Q&A. I think you hopefully got a feeling that we are setting us up well for 2025 and beyond to continue the leadership in this market and extend it. So we talked about the networks that we're building. It should be the best and the best performing. I think that's been a focus. And really now with the C-Band coming quickly and our Fios build-out, we feel really good about it. It's been important for us to focus the last couple of years on the differentiated value proposition for our customers. We know that there are more important services than ever. To have mobility and broadband is a necessity for every organization, every person on this planet and in the United States. The differentiating offerings that we're doing are enormously important, and they come from deep research what our customer really wants. And of course, together with a refreshed brand should support us for the continuation. Tony talked about capital allocation, and you have seen us being very prudent by the capital allocation. We promised to come down to BAU levels, we're on BAU levels. We have the high [indiscernible] C-band because we saw a great opportunity to quickly come out with that, and that were coming down. We're now doing investment to expand our total addressable market with the same offering, the same network. That's the strategy we have. We stay there and we see that we can continue to grow well and continue to create profitability and cash flow. So that's the overall strategy. And we are measured on three things: the wireless service revenue, the adjusted EBITDA and the cash flow. And we are very committed, the whole team here to continue to grow the service revenue and expand the EBITDA and cash flow going into 2025 and onwards with the investments we're doing right now and where we stand with our strategy, where we stand with our assets and we stand with our offering. So all in all, we feel very positive where we are right now. We feel positive where the market is and our products. By that, I'm going to close, and we're going to have a open Q&A. Brady will help us to manage that. I have my whole management team here, and we even have a pictures on them, if you don't know who they are. They are sitting to the left here for the ones on the webcast. You can see them here. So they are all here. So I'm going to diligently distribute answers to them. Probably going to take some myself. Any questions you might have for us. Brady going to do it, remember, present yourself when you're going to answer, so the webcast audience know who is asking the question. I'm going to take some help from Joe later on, but I'm going to start myself first. The BEAD program is, of course, contemplated in everything we have here. In the Fios footprint, it's obvious we will go for it when it makes sense for us, both from a return on investment. And so we -- in our Fios footprint, there's going to be great opportunities for us for sure, and we will be active on it. On the second one, when it comes to fiber or Fios versus fixed wireless access, I think -- I hope that you heard from Joe our strategy on fixed wireless access is a secondary business case on mobility. So we -- first of all, we deploy our C-Band for mobility. And the agreement that Joe and I have in the whole team is that we build mobility for two reasons: revenue generation as well as customer satisfaction. And then we get a secondary fixed wireless access opportunity. So it's not really thinking about where we do Fios or we do fixed wireless access. We do Fios and we do mobility. Then we create opportunities. And -- and I always love what we are doing because we give optionality for our customers. There are customers that just kills to get Fios. But there's others that really feel that fixed wireless access is a solution they want to have because of simplicity. So we're going to create optionality. And you saw the consumer slide that Sampath showed with customer offering framework, I think it's called, where actually everything is in the same model, regardless of what it takes. So that's how we think about it. Do you want to add something? Yes, you want to add something. Please come up here. Thank you. Next? On the future guidance, I'm going to leave that to Tony. On the first question, I'm going to start. I think to some extent, you're right. So think about this, we have had a target to create and get between 350,000 to 400,000 new broadband subscribers every quarter. And I think we've had that, but I'm not sure how many quarters. Sometimes up to 400, sometimes a little bit north of 350. What is happening right now is two things. First of all, the fixed wireless access is going into in a second sort of transformation because the C-Band is not going to suburban and rural. And of course, the opportunity is equally big, but the density is way less. So, we're going to see for a while that OFS, it's going to be a little bit less. And the second one is, as we're ramping up the Fios. You saw that we are doing some 450 to 500, going to 650 is a ramp-up. So, in the short-term, I think you're going to be in the lower end of that 350. And then I think when you see the ramping up of both of them, you're going to see a little bit different. So, I wouldn't say that we have changed anything on the pace. It's just a technicality of how we build right now and how we're ramping up Fios and actually going suburban to rural with our C-Band. So, those are the things. Tony, do you want to talk about guidance 2025 now? Great. I'm eager to hear. Next. A lot of assumptions here, continue. Okay, I'll leave the capital allocation for you, but I think that, of course, you can always find headwinds. We have a lot of -- or tailwinds as well in cash flow, and we will be very focused on that. So, I will let Tony go through the puts and takes on that. On the Frontier deal, I mean, first of all, if you have read the proxy, which you probably have done, it was a competitive process. We were asked for a best and final. We gave the best and final. We have a signed agreement and a contract for a merger. Now it is up to Frontier's shareholders to make the vote. We always have different type of strategies. We will continue to have that. This fitting in well right now. We're going to see what's going to happen, but we feel really confident that this is fair and good for all stakeholders. Tony? Thank you. I think about broadband, that's the thinking I have, and team has that as well. That means that we include both our Fios, as well as the fixed wireless access as broadband solutions. And as you have seen lately, they are doing well, both of them. And that's how we think about our customers, and we create optionality. So, I that nobody else is building on the pace that we are doing in the combination of it. That's how are we thinking. And remember, we build the network once. And then at the edge of network, we decide what type of connections we have. Sometimes it's Fios, sometimes it's 4G, sometimes its 5G, something is fixed wireless access, and then we get the best return on investment on the invested capital because we do it one. So that's the thinking we have, and that's how we serve our customers. So I feel good about the pace we have and how we're deploying this again with the financial mind in behind it to see that we get the best return on investment for our shareholders. Anybody want to add something to that? Okay, then you don't need to. Next? On the first question is no, there's no success-based fixed wireless access in the plan that we're presenting today. That's an optionality we have for the future. Right now, again, believe in our design principles because that makes the operation easier. It makes it easier for our customer, it makes it better for capital. That doesn't exclude it in the future that we will have success-based fixed wireless access. And then of course, I'm sure that Joe is building more capacity. So Kyle and Sampath has an opportunity to leverage on that. But in this plan, it's mobility first in all our C-Band. The second question is about the increase or the BAU level you have right now, how much is macro? You heard about what we said. We were trying to go to 80%, 90% of our planned radius having C-Band. And then you see the Fios up to 650. I think those are two important ones. There are other things coming down to some extent in our normal build because we have sort of come pretty far on the 4G, and we see much more traffic on the 5G. We have gone very far on our small cell with millimeter wave that is capturing a lot of our traffic in dense areas. That's a little bit smaller today. That doesn't mean we don't believe in it. We think it's super important. So I think those are the puts and takes in the CapEx. Joe? And one other thing that is increasing, which you mentioned was, of course, the MDU solution we have now for fixed wireless access, using millimeter wave. We have talked about it. We're going to put that in commercial use in next year. So that's, of course, also an opportunity, but of course, with a great return on investment. It's a range between 17.5 and 18.5. As I said, I think that this is a BAU level that we have in a steady state. I'm not going to guide for future years. I always said that if we see an opportunity where we can grow faster and we can invest more in CapEx, we will explain that if we go outside the normal BAU levels. Right now, we don't see that. Remember, we have talked about, there's no auctions for spectrum coming out at the moment. Usually, that is triggering or new. We don't even think 6G is in any of the plan of records we have right now. So it's a lot of things that usually catapult the higher investment level. We don't see them right now. So BAUs this level we are right now 17, 17.5 up to 18.5, that's where we're going to spend it. But ultimately, if we see opportunities, remember the capital allocation priorities, we spend it in business, but we also want to explain that is something additionally we can get and that we can share with our shareholders. But right now, the BAU levels are what you see from us right now. The big triggering events that you sometimes have, it's going to going to come 5G, its go spectrum auction. I don't have visibility of anything on that at the moment. Thank you. I think I'm going to ask Kyle to comment on that. If we talk about the GenAI opportunities, I talked about a three-pronged GenAI strategy we have. We have employee experience improvements right now already in the market when it comes to call agents, et cetera. We have our personalization for customers. And then we have our revenue opportunity. And as I alluded to, given the assets we have in our network, we see great opportunities for having a chance to earn business there, which we've already done. But maybe, Kyle, you can talk a little bit more about it. The second one doesn't include any M&A. And besides the one we have planned that you have announced. And B, as Joe said, there's no -- there's small pieces that will not rock the boat. We will make our numbers, regardless or BEAD or not. We will, of course, participate in BEAD that we can do. On the business side, those are in the number 8 to 9, yes, business side is included. And I have to say one of the things that Kyle and I are more surprised than others is, of course, the success we have had on the business side. Maybe you should talk about it on fixed wireless access on the business side, Kyle. And a good thing from a sort of a utility point of view, many of the customers that Kyle have, they are using the fixed wireless access on certain hours. The consumers are another hour. So this is just using the utility even better that we can sell it in and we can monetize all hours of the day with our network. Next. I think AI is definitely over a time frame. So how kind and I think about AI, generative AI especially, in the beginning right now, we see large language modules going to the big data centers out to the market all the time. As soon as they're going to be an application that you're going to use as an enterprise, you're going to put it much closer. For the main reason of the transport cost for privacy, for security and in some cases, also latency, maybe not equally much. But then you're going to see a big opportunity for us, given what Kyle talked about. And we will come back a little bit more specific on it, but definitely. But it's going to take some time from all these large language models to be real products and sitting in the edge of the network. So that's clear. Slicing is another area we talked about. We believe that we will probably start more in the business side and then we'll come to the consumer side and that we see as an opportunity as well. On the satellite, a little bit too early to see how large opportunity can be, I have to say, because, of course, we want to offer satellite to our customers in the white spaces, we are not allowed to build, for example, and see a direct device. A little bit too early on the consumer side to see if that's a business case. On the business side, yes, we can see that already for remote enterprise or things like that. So those three are new revenue opportunities on top of everything we've talked about in. It was a good question, Walter. There was a lot of things to unpack there. But ultimately, you're right on many things we're doing. You're right. We're trying to turn everything right, but we also had some headwinds that with program amortization, for example, that is a headwind for us. So but all in all, our focus is to really do right and do more value for our customers. And I think we are have proven now the last six, seven quarters that we talked about that we can do it. Not going to go into confirming any of your growth numbers or percentages, but we are incentivized to grow our wireless service revenue, that's part of all the teams sitting there and all the V Teamers, they are incentivized to do that.. So of course, our focus is going to be that because we have a leverage model. If we grow, it basically falls down even more to the bottom line, and then we can both improve our cash flow and/or adjusted EBITDA. So all the things you are saying is what we are doing on. I'm not going to commit to any numbers. But clearly, that is to grow faster over time or be sustainable. That's very important for us because that is how we return both cash flow to our shareholders and continue to be an attractive stock to invest in. No, it's not a deliberate choice. It is -- we look into everything and it's an option, but again, it has to be a good return on investment. So far, we haven't found any third-party models where we don't own the capital and somebody else own the capital that is really attractive with our return on capital because we have one of the best into return on capital in the industry and we want to see that, that continues. So far, it has been organic. We're doing it. But -- nothing is excluded here. I mean, I usually say that the CEO, you can never say that are never going to do it and then suddenly you do it, then everybody say you told us not. But -- so I couldn't exclude it, but so far, we haven't found any of those models that we think is attractive in our capital allocation and our return to our shareholders. And then adding also Sampath some of the combinations, we are unique. We're the only one who can do those combinations that we have had, for example, MAX and Netflix in the market. Nobody can combine that. That's how we have negotiated, so we have this flexibility and exclusivity to do it, and that is what is driving quite a lot of things. And all-in-all, every perk we have is a saving for you, for our customer. And of course, it's also a saving for our partners because ultimately, they're wholesaling to us, they don't have the cost of acquisition. But again, we only do it when we -- it's accretive for us as well. Has to be accretive for the customer, has to be accretive to us. And then we go forward and creating a very unique model. And sometimes, you might think this is pretty simple. But I'm looking at Shankar, with this our head of IT. Just imagine you can come into the store and actually be a Netflix customer and move over to be a Netflix customer to Verizon. We take care of all of that back end. The only thing you need to remember is your password. And sometimes that might be a problem, I know. But so just imagine how much work we have done to make this a unique offering that is hard to replicate, first of all, some of them are exclusive. And number two, you need to replicate a lot of things behind because if you're going to go home and then you log off and then you log on and cancel and everything. I can tell you the heat rate is low. Extremely low. And that's why we have worked so much with the customer experience here to do this in the right way. And I think that Sampath and Leslie and Shankar and the whole team have thought about how we make it simple for our customers. So I think this is just the beginning of us using the distribution as a strategy. We have the network. We have the distribution. We're just going to continue to do the right thing for our customers here, and that's going to pay off long term for us. Thank you. I guess we are wrapping up. First of all, thank you, everyone on the webcast, everyone coming here face-to-face in New York. Hopefully, you've got more insights, both to our third quarter, but also to our expanded broadband strategy, and for sure, we will back with more information as we have more quarters to come and other activities. So once again, thank you so much, guys, for coming. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Sampath and good morning. So our execution, as Sampath said is really strong, and it's fueling the momentum in our business. Our third quarter results, before we get into it, I do want to talk about the third quarter. Our ability to demonstrate customer growth and financial growth once again is a hallmark to our testament of execution day in and day out. And we delivered the highest ever reported adjusted EBITDA in our quarter. We're on track, as Hans mentioned, with our 2024 guidance, and at/or above the midpoint of our guided range for both wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA. If I go to the operational metrics from mobility, if you think about business and consumer, gross add and churn both improved year-over-year and that drove phone net adds of 239,000 in the third quarter. That's a significant improvement year-over-year. And as Sampath mentioned, we expect the consumer business to have positive postpaid phone net adds for the full year, and that's with and without the second number offering. And that's in addition to the continued strength in phone net adds from our business segment, and that's quarter after quarter of strong growth. If you think about broadband, we have almost 12 million subscribers in our base, and Fios and FWA are both growing. On broadband, we had 389,000 net adds in the quarter. That's another strong quarter for us. And inside of that, if you think about FWA, we've grown our FWA subscriber base over 1.5 million in that time period. And as you heard from the team today, there's much more opportunity for us to expand further. If we move to the financials, Hans talked about how we're measured, service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. If I start with service revenue, our service revenue is very healthy. Our wireless service revenue was up 3.1% year-to-date or $1.8 billion. Our EBITDA continues to be strong. And even in a quarter where we delivered a very strong $12.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, we took actions around revenue and cost efficiencies to set us up for 2025. That strong EBITDA led to free cash flow of $14.5 billion year-to-date, and that's consistent with the prior year. And that includes an increase of $2.5 billion in cash taxes. The cash generation of the business continues to be very strong, and we have ample flexibility and funding to execute on our capital allocation priorities. The business is performing well, and we have good momentum as we close 2024 and head into 2025. And if I shift over to capital allocation, as many of you know, we have four capital allocation priorities and they remain unchanged. Our first capital allocation priority is to invest in the business. And that includes investments in our network infrastructure. If you think about C-Band, if you think about Fios, it includes M&A to accelerate our strategy. If you think about the pending acquisition of Frontier, and it also includes being opportunistic with wireless spectrum as evidenced by the deal we signed last week with US Cellular. As we said before, we're back to BAU levels of capital spend, and we're on track with our 2024 capital program. If we look ahead to 2025 in terms of guidance for 2025, we expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion for the next year. And that's an all-in number that includes all of our growth initiatives. So that includes C-Band and the continuation of rolling out C-Band. Joe talked about having 80% to 90% of our sites on C-Band by the end of 2025. It includes our Fios continued open-for-sale expansion up to 650,000 new open for sale on Fios. And it includes the broadband MDU solution, the multi-dwelling solution that Joe mentioned. All of these things are included in that 17.5 to 18.5 number. And that range gives us the flexibility to both invest for growth and be disciplined and efficient with our capital spend. Our second priority is our commitment to the dividend. And as you've seen recently, we've raised dividend for the 18th consecutive year. That's an accomplishment we're extremely proud of. And as we said many times, our goal is to put the Board a position for further dividend increases. Our third capital allocation priority is having a strong balance sheet. We've made significant progress delevering the balance sheet since the acquisition of C-Band. As of the of the end the third quarter, our unsecured leverage stands at 2.50 times. That's the ratio of net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our focus is to continue to pay down debt between now and the closing of the Frontier deal. And today, we're announcing an update to our long-term leverage target of 2.0 to 2.25 times. Given our cash flows and overall financial strength, this is the appropriate range for our business to provide flexibility to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. Our fourth capital allocation priority is share buybacks. And as we've said many times, we will consider share buybacks but our unsecured leverage metric reaches 2.25 times, and that target is unchanged. As we work towards that target, we continue to focus on generating strong cash flows and paying down debt. Our capital allocation strategy is disciplined and deliberate. And as you've seen from our track record, we'll continue to focus on operational execution and performance and deliver on our commitments. We're excited about the opportunities we have ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back to Hans. Sure. Hey John, thanks for the question. So, look, as we said we said this morning, we're on track with our service revenue, and we said we'd be at or above the midpoint on service revenue. If we think about next year, I'm not going to guide on 2025 right now. But in terms of puts and takes, we've taken a lot of actions to position ourselves for sustained growth. So, that includes the P&Q that you heard from Sampath, so volume improvements in pricing, and it also includes fixed wireless access, and you see the great growth that we've seen on fixed wireless access. Prepaid, has now, Sampath mentioned, turned positive. So, that's been a headwind this year. We would expect that to start to turn next year. We're still facing headwinds with program amortization. So, those are the puts and takes as we head into next year, and we'll bring it back to you in January. Hey Dave, so we're not going to guide on free cash flow, but a few things. I mean, the same puts and takes that we shared at the beginning of the year still remain intact. So, see the EBITDA growth, and that's the focus for next year. Interest, in terms of deleveraging, we'll have to see where rates go. That will have an impact. And then cash taxes, as you mentioned, they're up this year. We'll have to see what happens on the legislative front. They're going to be up -- we said $2.5 billion so far this year. We'll see where that goes. And working capital, we're not seeing a big upgrade cycle right now. The upgrades were down 10%. Right now, customers are choosing to hang on to their phones a lot longer, and that's by choice. The average upgrade rate, and Sampath can correct me, but it's probably 40 months or so. So that hasn't changed. So we're going to continue to stay disciplined and segmented in our approach and then we'll come back on our thoughts on cash flow back in January. Thanks."

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning we posted to our Invest Relations website a detailed review of our second quarter results. You'll find additional details in the earnings materials on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Brady. Good morning and welcome to Verizon's second quarter 2024 earnings call. This quarter marks the beginning of Verizon's next chapter. We have launched a comprehensive brand refresh that goes far beyond the new logo. This transformation embodies our commitment to bringing choice, value, and control to our customers' lives, reflecting our evolution and vision for the future of connectivity. We refreshed our brand as our strategy continues to deliver strong results. The three pillars of our performance, wireless service revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, expansion and increased free cash flow remain solid, showing both sequential and year-over-year improvements. In the second quarter, we saw wireless service revenue climb 3.5% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA rise by 2.8%, and free cash flow increased 3% compared to last year. Our improving operations and results build on our first quarter momentum, keep us on track to meet our 2024 financial guidance and are paving the way for a sustained growth. Our progress comes from innovation that deeply resonates with customers, including the most personalized offerings in the industry. These initiatives align perfectly with our core strategy to strengthen and grow customer relationships while delivering the best return on invested capital. We launched myPlan in 2023 and it delighted our customers. In just over a year, over 30% of our subscribers are using it. That is an incredible adoption rate and now we're bringing these features to Home Internet with myHome. We're building and expanding on our strengths and successes and you can expect that to continue. For businesses we launched Verizon Business Complete, the industry's only end-to-end smartphone management system. We cover everything from selecting the first phone to upgrades with 24-hour service and same-day equipment replacement. These initiatives, combined with our strong network performance and extensive distribution, are reinforcing our leadership position and driving our industry forward. Turning to the second quarter. We had a strong operational performance across mobility, broadband and our network. Our overall execution in consumer mobility has been improving quarter-after-quarter since early last year and our momentum continues. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds are up 12% year-over-year, which is amazing. Total postpaid phone net adds of 148,000 is a big improvement year-over-year and sequentially, and we expect to have positive postpaid phone net adds in consumer for the year. Choice is at the core of our approach, and we're constantly working on new partnerships that give our customers more options and value. One example is our addition of YouTube Premium and Peacock subscriptions which makes us the only provider offering our customers savings on 10 of the top streaming services. These content partnerships give our customers compelling reasons to shop with us. We also had a very strong quarter for postpaid phone net adds in Verizon Business at 156,000. This is a sharp improvement from the first quarter and shows how important we are to small, mid-sized and large businesses. Our business customers continue to invest in mobility and we offer them the widest range of choices. In the consumer value market, we are applying the same customer-centric discipline and rigor as we do in the post-paid market and are seeing significant net add improvements excluding SafeLink. We recently relaunched Total by Verizon as Total Wireless and enhanced our offerings with price guarantees, upgrade credits and other features. In broadband, we're still taking share with 391,000 net adds in the second quarter. Fixed wireless access remains a key driver with higher net adds than in the first quarter. We continue to grow our broadband base ending the quarter with more than 11.5 million broadband subscribers. We're also continuing to add business from large customers like government agencies. We're very proud that we were awarded a new contract from the U.S. Department of the Navy to provide wireless devices and device management building on our previous work together. For first responders, Verizon frontline delivers mission-critical connectivity and advanced solution to more than 40,000 public safety agencies across the United States, serving them with everything from device and network management to digital transformation. Verizon is there when people need us most from protecting the front-lines to natural disaster response. In fact, recent FCC data show us that overall our network outperformed our peers in areas affected by the Hurricane Beryl. I could not be proud of that. It's one of the reasons we're so committed to the network superiority and we're continuing to expand C-Band in suburban and rural areas. Our initial C-Band markets outperform with better gross add growth, higher uptake of premium services, and lower churn. We now have nearly half of our network traffic running on ultra-wideband, up from 36% a year ago. That number will continue to grow as we expand C-band reach. We're also working to enhance our network coverage by partnering with AST SpaceMobile to provide satellite to device connectivity using the 850 megahertz spectrum. This will bring our network to unserved communities, as we target 100% coverage from coast to coast. Our portfolio of high performance spectrum, the capacity of our fiber and our ability to deploy and support mobile edge compute, make us as the backbone of the AI economy and the partner of choice for players in the space. We will power the best AI services for our customers. What set us apart with AI is our network's mobile edge computing capabilities and deep fiber footprint. By processing data closer to the source, we enable real-time AI application that requires security, ultra-low latency, and high bandwidth. This is where our network shines, opening up possibilities that simply weren't feasible before. We're already seeing the benefits of AI in our operations. For example, we use AI to route customer support calls to agents best-suited to help. We analyze more than 800 data points per call to save our customers time and spare them frustration. It takes the best network to power these applications and today RootMetrics awarded us an outright win for national overall wireless network performance. Verizon also won the most national, state, and metro awards, including outright wins for accessibility, data performance, and streaming video performance. This is a kind of superior network performance that our customers deserve and expect from us. I'm pleased with our first half-year performance on how well our team is executing our strategy. I always say there's more work to do and there always is. We are seeing improving postpaid phone net adds in consumer, performing extremely well in business and taking share in broadband. We are achieving growth in a disciplined, balanced way and have built great momentum heading into the second half of the year and into 2025. Now I would hand over the call to Tony for a deeper dive into our performance.\nTony Skiadas : Thanks Hans and good morning. Our second quarter results reflected accelerated growth in wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as we continue to generate strong free cash flow. These results were driven by strong operational execution in both consumer and business, which led to sequential net add improvements in postpaid phones, fixed wireless access, and prepaid excluding SafeLink. Within consumer, postpaid phone gross adds were approximately 1.8 million in the second quarter, a 12% year-over-year increase. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth. Excluding our second number offering, consumer post-paid phone gross adds grew 5% year-over-year. Consumer post-paid phone churn was 0.79% in the second quarter, up slightly from the prior year period. This was in-line with our expectations as we recently implemented several price increases that are expected to generate well over $1 billion in annualized wireless service revenue. We believe the majority of the pricing churn is now behind us and we continue to expect full-year consumer postpaid phone churn to be flat or slightly better than last year. Consumer postpaid phone net losses were 8,000 for the second quarter, which marks a significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. For the full year, we expect to deliver positive consumer postpaid phone net adds without the contribution from our second number offering. Moving to prepaid, we continue to make progress with our core brands while navigating the conclusion of the ACP program. Overall prepaid net losses were 624,000, including 410,000 losses related to the ACP shutdown, the vast majority of which are in our SafeLink brand. Excluding SafeLink, prepaid net losses were 12,000, a substantial improvement compared to the prior year period. Visible and total wireless continue to expand and perform well, while our operational execution with Straight Talk continues to improve. We exited the quarter with good momentum and prepaid, setting the stage for a stronger performance in the second half of 2024 and positioning us well for 2025. On the business side, postpaid phone net adds were 156,000 in the second quarter, the best performance in the last six quarters. We saw a strong sequential improvement of phone net adds across small and medium businesses, as well as enterprise and public sector customers. Turning to broadband, our total broadband net additions were 391,000 for the quarter, representing the eighth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 broadband net adds. In fixed wireless access, we continue to focus on building a long-term sustainable business. Total fixed wireless net adds were 378,000 in the quarter, up sequentially. This brings our base above 3.8 million subscribers, up nearly 69% year-over-year. Consumer fixed wireless net adds were 218,000, a 15,000 sequential increase as we continue to see healthy demand for reliable broadband even in a seasonally softer quarter. Verizon business continued strong execution with 160,000 fixed wireless access net adds, a quarterly record. Demand for the service is strengthening as small businesses and enterprises continue to trust the reliability of the product and speed and ease of deployment. Overall, Fios Internet net adds totaled 28,000 for the quarter. We are pleased with the continuous growth of Fios, even with the effects of the ACP shutdown and lower move activity. We ended the quarter with over 11.5 million broadband subscribers, a 17% increase from a year ago. Our broadband growth continues to significantly outpace that of the broader market, given our superior network experience and strong execution. Moving to the financials, we delivered another solid quarter and remain on track to meet our full year financial guidance. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter totaled $32.8 billion, a 0.6% increase year-over-year. That growth was driven by service and other revenue which grew 1.8% year-over-year, partially offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue, as total upgrades were down nearly 13% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue totaled $19.8 billion, a sequential increase of more than $250 million, and year-over-year growth of 3.5% or $660 million. The increase was primarily driven by consumer wireless service revenue, which grew 3.7% year-over-year to $16.3 billion. Consumer postpaid ARPA grew 5% year-over-year, reflecting the benefits of pricing actions and fixed wireless growth. In addition, myPlan helps to drive ARPA growth through premium mix adoption and [Perk] (ph) revenue. As Hans said, we now have over 30% of our consumer phone lines on myPlan and expect this to expand meaningfully going forward. FWA revenue which is included in wireless service revenue was $514 million for the quarter, up more than $200 million versus the prior year period. Launched at scale in 2021, our FWA business is expected to generate more than $2 billion in revenue this year with prospects for continued healthy growth. Prepaid revenue for the quarter declined $162 million versus the prior year period. The headwind to wireless service revenue growth from the ACP shutdown was approximately 30 basis points within the range we provided last quarter, and the margin impact was insignificant. With the majority of ACP disconnects now behind us and the momentum growing in our core prepaid brand, we are better positioned for the remainder of the year and heading into 2025. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $12.3 billion an increase of 2.8% year-over-year. The improved operating leverage reflects the lower upgrade activity and our disciplined approach to growth. We are making progress in our ongoing cost efficiency program and recently introduced new measures to improve our operating efficiency, including a voluntary separation program announced in June. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.15, down 5% compared to the prior year period. Growth in adjusted EBITDA was offset by below-the-line items, including higher interest expense, predominantly due to lower capitalized interest as we put more C-band spectrum into service. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $16.6 billion for the first half of the year compared to $18 billion in the prior year period. The results reflect higher cash taxes of approximately $1.7 billion, predominantly due to the unwind of bonus depreciation, as well as higher interest expense primarily driven by the decrease in capitalized interest. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $8.1 billion. This was $2 billion less than the same period last year as we have returned to historical levels of capital intensity. The network build remains ahead of schedule with C-band deployed on nearly 60% of our planned sites. Our full year guidance for CapEx spending remains unchanged at a range of $17 billion to $17.5 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $8.5 billion for the first half of 2024. This represents an increase of nearly 7% or approximately $550 million from the prior year period, despite higher cash taxes and interest expense. We expect to generate strong cash flow in the back half of the year that will support paying down debt. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $122.8 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the previous quarter and $3.7 billion lower year-over-year. Our net unsecured debt to a consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times, an improvement from 2.6 times last quarter. The strength of our results and momentum in our business put us in a great position to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In particular, we remain on track to further reduce the leverage on our balance sheet in the second half of the year. In summary with 2024, reaching its midpoint, the team's strong execution and operating momentum is translating into results. We have good momentum in mobility as reflected by the strong gross add growth and continue to take share in broadband through fixed wireless access and Fios. Importantly, we are accomplishing this with a disciplined approach, balancing growth and profitability providing the confidence to deliver on our 2024 financial guidance. With that, I will turn it back to Hans for his final remarks before opening the call to your questions.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. Our focus for the second half of the year remains clear to drive growth in wireless service revenue, expand adjusted EBITDA and generate strong free cash flow. We are evolving our broadband strategy as we approach 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers, and we'll continue to scale the business along with the private networks while driving mobility growth. Our ongoing C-band expansion will be crucial in supporting these efforts, enhancing our network performance and opening new opportunities across markets. Our commitment to a differentiated customer experience and operational excellence remains firm. The success of myPlan and our brand refresh are proof of our ability to meet evolving customer needs. We will build on these successes in the quarters ahead, as we work to deliver value to all of our stakeholders. We will continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities by investing in the business, supporting our dividend and paying down debt. As AI continues to reshape our industry, Verizon is well-positioned to enable and benefit from it. Our reliable, secure and powerful network will be at the forefront of AI and mobile edge compute applications. This is an exciting time for us at Verizon. Mobility, broadband and cloud, our essential services and their value has never been higher. We power and empower how people live, work and play. We are in a great business and there's so much more to come. We have the right assets and the strategy in place for success this year and beyond. I'm more excited than ever about what lies ahead of us. Now Brady, we are ready to take questions.\nBrady Connor : Thanks Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thank you and good morning, guys. Two questions, if I can. First, on ACP, was there any impact on the broadband side in the quarter? And do you expect any lingering impact from ACP, either in prepaid or postpaid or broadband, as we look out into the second half? And then second on upgrades, obviously another strong quarter with record, I think, record low upgrades. Given the AI phones coming out in the second, third quarter, how do you expect that to trend? And what do you expect the impact to be on the financials of the wireless business as we look out into the second half?\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, John. On the ACP, Tony will give you the details. But yes, we had some impact on the prepaid brand as was expected, and also a little bit on Fios. Looking forward I see this is a great opportunity. I mean 21 million people having ACP and the importance of mobility and broadband today is so important. And our offerings, but all the way from broadband with Verizon forward, fixed wireless access, both very efficient and then on the prepaid brands. So I see that as an opportunity going forward, but some slight impact on volumes this quarter. On the upgrades, as you have seen the upgrades has been a little bit low for a while. It is two things. First of all, the quality of the phones has continued to go up. But secondly, I think even more important is the discipline that we have shown over the years right now, I think for the last 1.5 years, how we do the promotions, how we look at the customer investment bucket and see that we are actually distributing our money. We are going to see what's going to happen in this cycle. I don't feel very worried about it. I feel that we are in a great position to handle it, and it's all in our guide what we are expecting. So I don't see any major things happening here. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah, thanks. Good morning John. In terms of ACP updates, let me give you a couple of things here. So as we said previously, the majority of the ACP exposure is in our prepaid business. And as we said last time, we had about 1.1 million prepaid subs that benefited from the ACP program. In the quarter -- in the second quarter, we saw about 400,000 prepaid disconnects. This is the vast majority of what we expected. There is minimal impact on the postpaid side as I think was part of your question. We saw some pressure in Fios in terms of gross add opportunity. If we look ahead in the third quarter, we expect some disconnects in prepaid and a small number across other products. In terms of revenue, we also said that any impact that we would see we'd see on service revenue up to 50 basis points of headwind and we're tracking inside of that number right now. And even with the disconnects, the margin exposure from ACP was insignificant in the second quarter. So we will continue to keep everyone updated as we progress here.\nJohn Hodulik: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, great. Thanks John. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open sir.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. On fixed wireless, you talked about the strong momentum. You obviously have a lot of C-band still to build out would expand your addressable market. I guess you're going to hit the $4 million, the low end of your guide probably in the August timeframe. So help us think about what's the potential beyond the $4 million to $5 million. And when you can give us more clarity on your opportunity there? I think you've talked before about plenty of excess capacity. And then there were media reports the other day about you looking potentially to monetize towers. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about tower sales or other real estate, other asset monetization? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you Simon. On fixed wireless access, you are rightfully say it. We have good momentum came into this quarter with 378,000 new net adds on fixed wireless access doing strong, both on consumer, as well as on a business. And we are now expanding our C-band to suburban and rural, which is another type of opportunity, less penetrated, but also more vastly distributed. So we are gearing for getting to our target between 4 million and 5 million fixed wireless access broadband customers. And as soon as we get there as I've said before, I will come back and see how we see the opportunity going forward. But clearly, we have a great network that can ingest more customers over time. But let me come back on the exact details of that when we reach the target. On the towers, I mean, or any rumor I wouldn't comment on any rumor. What you should know is that Tony and I are very committed to improve our cash flow, whatever we can see to see that we optimize our assets, we will do that but I have no comments or rumors in the market. But the focus on cash flow is extremely important because it goes straight into our capital priorities. That's why we've been so focused on for the last couple of years, and we did yet again in this quarter, good progress on them.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks, Hans.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, great. Thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open sir.\nJim Schneider: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I may. First, on broadband. Could you comment on sort of the overall health of the broadband market that you are seeing? And then maybe any more quantitative guidance you can give us on the amount of headroom you see in your overall network capacity relative to fixed wireless subscribers? And then secondly, on the wireless side. In terms of the service revenue growth, what's your level of confidence that you can drive more volume growth and still maintain the same level of pricing power over the next 12 months or so? And how do you expect that volume price split to work out for you over the next year or so?\nHans Vestberg: So on the broadband, I think again, we are between 375,000 to 400,000 net adds in broadband this quarter, been it for quite a while. So we see it as a very healthy. I think also we have a really good offering. And now with myHome that we just announced, I think we are going to be even stronger on it. So we see it healthy. Of course, Fios is by far the best fiber product in the market. And then fixed wireless access, the differentiation of the product, how we deploy it, how the customer provision it so different. And with all the streaming agreements we have right now, we can scale that horizontally to all our customers. So I see it is a very healthy business for us today. When it comes to our capacity on fixed wireless access -- yet again, I mean as we said, less than -- around 50% of all the traffic is now on C-band. So we have a way to go and we have deployed only a portion. So as we deploy more, we of course open up more opportunities. Finally, and maybe Tony has some addition. On the volume growth, I'm excited of what we have done in the consumer side with myPlan, and all the new innovations were done with our customers, and we see it resonate with the market. And clearly, quarter-by-quarter, we have improved both our revenue but also operation volumes on postpaid. Prepaid you saw it yourself, a big step forward on prepaid this quarter. And then our business side, I mean Kyle and the team has been now for I\u2019m not sure how many quarters been around 125, up to 150 net adds on wireless. So all-in-all, I see that with the offerings that we put into the market, the refresh of the brand that is supporting that we are in a good position going into the second half of this year. Tony, any additions to that?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah. Thanks, Hans. So very comfortable with the revenue guide for the year. As Hans said, the performance and execution is very much on track, and we continue to find a better balance of P&Q. And you see the progress on volumes, as Hans said, B2 mobility and SWA. And maybe just a few additional points to consider. First we expect to see sequential growth in service revenue in the second half of the year. Also, I would say the year-over-year comps are a little more challenging in the second half as we lap the pricing changes from 2023. The wildcard obviously, is the promotional environment and the level of upgrades we'll have to see where that goes. But having said all that, the assumptions that we have in the service revenue guide have not changed. So overall, we feel good about our revenue performance and the momentum in the business, and we're not going to guide on '25 at this time, but I would tell you that those assumptions will carry forward as well.\nJim Schneider: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan. Your line is open sir.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the 2024 consumer postpaid phone expectations to report positive net adds for the year, excluding the second-line. If you could perhaps maybe help us think about the pace or expectations for the second-line contribution in the back half of the year? Obviously, a pretty healthy run rate here in the second quarter on a full quarterly basis relative to the first quarter. So just how should we think about that in terms of trying to unpack the underlying benefit relative to the second-line benefit? And then, Tony another quick question, just helpful color there on service revenue expectations, quarterly growth over the balance of the year. But can you perhaps help us think about margins? Obviously, decent -- nice growth here in the second quarter in business. How should we think about the contribution or perhaps from the HCL Tech Managed Services savings coming through? And I think you also mentioned there was a voluntary separation program in the market. I think we had seen headlines to that intra-quarter. How should we think about maybe the contributions from those two items impacting margin and maybe EBITDA growth expectations or how you're thinking about the phasing of those in the back half. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I'll start and Tony will give you the details. As we said before, I mean the second-line offering is straight into our strategy. The strategy is to build the network ones and have as many profitable connections on top of it in order to get the best return on invested capital. And you can see that is really happening, and that's been a very big focus for us. Tony will give you some more details on how it looks in the second half here. On the programs of cost, we put in last year a couple of really large programs all the way from agreement with HL together with large customer care changes. Many of those are now coming into the base, and that's why you see the leverage. But we also have quite a lot of new things coming up. And as you rightfully mentioned, we have a voluntary separation program that is ongoing right now. We also have all the efficiencies with AI that is coming through. And of course we continue with our disciplined approach on investments. So all-in-all, there is more things to come. And -- but we have gotten leverage from some of the things we did last year, Tony.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks. Hi, Sebastiano. On the second number, just a few points, Hans touched on this upfront, but this is a great business. We are providing customers options and flexibility. It is a very profitable connection and we would do it every day of the week. In terms of the market for this, we'll see how the TAM evolves. We shared the gross add impact you can assume some level of churn in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect less of a contribution from second number in the back half of the year. It is high-margin business comparable to ARPU [add-a-line] (ph) offerings. The ARPU is very good and very comparable to add-a-line, without the device subsidy. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive phone net adds in consumer for the year without the contribution from second number. And the results in the quarter reflect the strength of our core business. And then on your question on EBITDA and cost transformation, we're very comfortable with the EBITDA guide. We made a lot of progress. You saw the 80 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. And the program in terms of delivering cost transformation is on track. Hans talked about some of the work we are doing, and we did last year with customer care and with managed services. We have a lot of work going on right now between IT and real estate, and network decommissioning. In addition, Hans mentioned the voluntary separation program. And some of that savings will start manifesting in the back end of this year and into 2025. And then lastly AI is an enabler of efficiencies. You can think about customer care, you can think about the personalization with myPlan. And we see efficiencies coming from there as well. But we're very much on track. We are operating differently. And we feel good about the progress on cost actions that are driving the improvements in EBITDA that you see in the first half of the year.\nSebastiano Petti: Great. Thank you for the question.\nBrady Connor : Yeah, thanks Sebastiano. Brad we are ready for the next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. I'm curious on the pricing front, where does in wireless postpaid the back book sit on average relative to your front book offers? And do you think the pricing environment in the postpaid wireless category can start to look more like fixed broadband or the video product categories where those products have tended to see some kind of pricing actions on a somewhat annual basis?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you Mike. I think in general, when we see the value accretion we have done recently, very much about new offerings to see that our customers are getting more value from the offerings we have. We have done some price adjustments historically. I think that Sampath in the consumer side has said that he would get better balance between volume and value increases. So that's what you see right now. And then on the business side, we have constantly done a great job. I mean Kyle and his team has constantly continue with a really high market share, continue to gain in every area like government, large enterprise and SMBs. So in the quarter you saw that the offerings we're doing with myHome and the additions on myPlan. And of course, with also the new offerings in business, Business Complete which is a new way to serve our SMBs. All of them are accretive and value but also giving our customers better services. So that's how we continue to work. And we are in sort of the third-phase of wireless where wireless is so important for our customers, and we see it also as an opportunity with the largest direct-to-consumer business in the country to actually add support with them with new services and layering on. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Just a couple of other things to add. I mean as we said upfront, we said we need to find a better balance of P&Q in 2024, and we are doing that. We are very confident, Mike in our back book. We've been very consistent, as Hans said, about evaluating pricing opportunities, aligning the price with the value proposition for customers. We did take pricing actions in the first half of the year that provide a good tailwind to service revenue, and those pricing actions were contemplated in the guide, but it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on what we might do in the future.\nMichael Rollins: Yeah, thanks.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Mike. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question sir.\nDavid Barden: Hi guys. Thanks so much. So Tony, yes, you guys had real demonstrable success on the P side of the equation and it helps to be the industry upward. Can we talk a little bit more about the Q -- the account number that you reported this quarter, I think it's the lowest that we've seen since the data I have going back from 2016. And so the way that the queue is growing is by kind of a shrinking number of accounts, but putting more and more into those accounts. I'm guessing the second-line strategy is one of those strategies. But can you talk a little bit about what kind of duration, durability this approach to growth has and -- or do we need to see accounts grow in order to believe that Verizon is really on the right growth path? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Hi, David. Good morning. So look as we said before, finding the right balance of P&Q. And I think you've heard Sampath and I talk about something like 80-20 price-volume mix last year was more like 100, so clearly making progress on that. And keep in mind, we have a very high-quality customer base, and we see it in the results quarter-after-quarter. And I think you see the momentum in both gross adds and in net adds in the quarter, and it is very high-quality growth, both on the consumer and the business side. Business had a very strong quarter as well on volumes. And you also see the growth in fixed wireless access. We did 378,000 fixed wireless access net adds that continue to provide a tailwind to service revenue. So we are trying to find that right balance of P&Q, and I think the results reflect that.\nDavid Barden: Great.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Dave. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Your line is open sir.\nPeter Supino: Good morning. Thanks. A question about capital allocation. As we approach 2025 and your leverage target, I'm wondering how you would encourage us to think or how you do think about the possibility of building more fiber as opportunity costing that against share repurchases. I wonder how you think about the returns on each of those projects. And separately, to the extent that capital is scarce, is there an argument for maintaining leverage at a constant level and even more of above? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Hi, Peter. When it comes to our capital allocation priorities, they haven't changed. I mean first of all, we put the money in the business. And this year, we have the guide between [$17 billion and $17.5 billion] (ph). So -- but of course, if we see opportunities to gain more revenue and grow business, we will always look into the business side. Secondly, the dividend is very important. I mean we have now been growing our dividend for 17 consecutive quarters. And Tony and my job of -- years, not quarters. And Tony and I are committed to continue to put the Board in a position to do that. And you see on our pay ratio, we're well inside that ratio doing well. And then we're paying down our debt. We paid down debt this quarter. Second half, we're going to continue with that. We will not consider any conversation about buybacks until we get to 225. And after that there is a lot of factors in the market, the priorities but also where is the interest rates, where is share price and all of that. So let us focus on the priority in the order we have said, and that's how we are going to continue for the next foreseeable future.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Peter. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question sir.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks. I want to return to the upgrade cycle. Apple is obviously betting that they can drive a significant upgrade cycle with AI. I wonder if you could just talk about the percentage of phones in your base that are, I believe Apple's requirement will be 8 gigabytes of RAM and -- meaning it's going to be the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max. What percentage of your phones are already of that level? And how many would presumably require upgrades? And then how you just -- how do you think about how quickly that upgrade cycle comes and what that might mean in terms of the cost and margins for your wireless business?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. I don't have the exact number, but I know that we have a fair amount of new phones, of course in the base because with our high quality customer base on postpaid, many of our customers are already on later versions of the iPhones. Again looking into this cycle, I mean, -- of course, we are going to see some excitement around AI. I don't think that it is going to be any particular at this time. It will be over time, maybe. We have a very disciplined model when it comes to a approach expectations for promotion, et cetera. We will stick to that. we believe that we have such a great network, great offerings. So we can actually manage that, and we will continue to do so. And then talking about the AI. I mean I think where I'm most excited is, of course that we have built sort of the Verizon Intelligent edge network which will be the platform for the GenAI economy because you are going to have to have a lot more compute storage at the edge of the network, and that's how we built the network already 2018 with fiber to all our main hubs and between our main subcenters. And then on top of that, we have cooling and power at those edges. And I think as we go from the LLMs and we go into sort of doing commercial products for enterprises. Our network is set up for that. And so I'm very excited for that opportunity going forward together with private networks. So \u2013 there is a lot of things coming into GenAI devices, our efficiencies but also a business opportunity for us when it comes to AI.\nBrady Connor : Great, thanks Craig. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open sir.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. To what extent do you think that fixed mobile conversion will be more of the norm in the US? And given your smaller wireline footprint, do you think you need to expand your fiber-to-the-home assets? Or how would you address that? And then want to clarify the target leverage you are looking for, is that 2.2 times total leverage or 2.2 times unsecured? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: On the mobile convergence fixed mobile convergence, we see some uptick on that. As I said before, we will follow the customers. We have all these economics on wireless and on broadband. And we will see that if our customer wants to have a converged product, we will do that. I don't believe in sort of discounting products to get there. But of course, our efficiency if one customer has both mobility and broadband from us, and we will see that we share that with our customers as an opportunity. So I don't think we are going to see the European levels here because of the nature of the market. But as we move further into convergence, we will be very well positioned with the products we have. Tony, on the leverage?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. So Frank, on the leverage metric, the long-term goal is 1.75 to 2 on the unsecured. And then we said we would consider buybacks when we got to 2.25, again unsecured.\nFrank Louthan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks Frank. We are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open sir.\nTimothy Horan: Hi, guys. Focusing back on the network. I know the C-band initial deployments were just for a portion of the spectrum and they weren't used in the full range of technologies. And I know you said 60%. Can you talk about -- where are you with kind of upgrading to the entire C-band level of spectrum and to Massive MIMO and also then to stand-alone? And kind of related to this, I know you saw some major network improvements with the initial upgrades or build out to C-band. Can you talk about what you're seeing when you go back with the second upgrade? And I have a follow-up on what you do with AI? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: On the C-band, you are right. We almost have now 50% of our traffic on the C-band, but we still have some deployment to be done in suburban and rural. Many of those sites are prepared for it, so we are just rolling out as we speak right now. So we are going to see that continue. Joe and his team in technology, very much focused on customer satisfaction when it comes to the rollout and revenue generation right now. That's the main focus we have at Verizon. And the same trend as we saw in the beginning where we have better upgrades, lower churn, whereas C-band and of course also getting fixed wireless access opportunity. The same goes for where we are enhancing or continuing to new areas. Secondly you asked about all the new features coming into 5G advance with SA, Massive MIMO, all of that is just expanding our capacity and bringing even more opportunities for us for revenue and seeing that we create the customer expectations on the best network in the nation. So -- and that's just -- we're just in the beginning of that. So I'm very pleased with what I see. The team is running as fast as we can and we get good feedback on C-band. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Thanks, Hans. So just a couple of other points. On C-band, we are seeing good improvements in churn 3 basis points. On gross adds, we see about 9 basis points gross add strength. And as we deploy suburban and rural gross adds are up threefold in those markets. And then premium mix continues to be stronger as well of about 10%. And we do have now at this point nearly 60% of our planned sites are now deployed with C-band. So really making really good progress.\nTimothy Horan: And I'm assuming you need stand-alone to enable some of these AI/MEC applications you're talking about, and I can be wrong about that, but any upgrade on the timing of when standalone gets deployed nationwide? And do you have any of these AI/MEC applications that are up and running now? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: We can do mobile edge compute without SA. We have done that for five years. Then there are some efficiencies on especially private networks and deployment with SA. But again, you need a full ecosystem all the way from the devices and the network features and the core in order to do that. So it is a little bit of a holistic thinking again when we work it, but we can already deliver that right now. When it comes to GenAI in mobile edge compute, that -- we don't have that to our customers right now. But the conversation with many of both the cloud players as well as enterprises of doing that when they have commercial products, and not only training large language modules. And that's how we designed our network. So that's why I'm excited of it. At the same time, we already have four GenAI products in the market that is deployed on 40,000 agents to all our stores, et cetera personalization, more efficiency for customer and employee experience. And we see a great opportunity for that. So there are multiple opportunities with AI for us and we have been on to it for a long time.\nTimothy Horan: Great.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Tim. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Your line is open sir.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Tony, I think in the prepared remarks, you referenced voluntary separation program in June. I wonder if you can give us a sense of -- I mean I know you've done these in the past potential EBITDA benefit. And just remind us, does this result like in, I guess, onetime charges relative to the severance or the separation payments that are made and just kind of quantify that a bit, if you can?\nTony Skiadas: Sure. Hi Walt. So a couple of things. We announced the program in early June for a portion of our workforce. The process is not going to be fully completed until the back end of August. So I don't have numbers at this point. It was contemplated in their full year guide. And we do expect to see savings towards the back end of 2024 and into 2025, and we'll come back with disclosures on the program once it is finalized. We'll file an 8-K similar to how we did it last time.\nWalter Piecyk: Okay. And then Hans, it is not a reported number, but you can kind of calculate what wholesale revenue looks like and we know who the principal driver of that is. It seemed like that was kind of strong this quarter sequentially. I don't know, if there is some seasonality there. I'm looking last year and the year before, it doesn't seem like that. So is this a good thing or a bad thing, obviously, because it could imply stronger growth at a wholesale customer at the expense of your retail business. And just can you give us a sense in general of your outlook for that line. There has been some discussion and debate about how some terms can change or other offloading activities can occur for that customer. So just if you can comment on the quarter and just generally your outlook for wholesale in terms of a component of your sectors of growth, like how important is wholesale in terms of meeting the growth targets that you promised the Board?\nHans Vestberg: I don't have any comments on the quarter on the numbers. We try to have our Chinese [Walls] (ph) here, so I don't have it. But in general, we see these partnership has imported enterprise customers. And it goes back to the strategy we have, meaning we build the network once. And we have -- want to have as many profitable connections on top of the network in order to get the best return on invested capital. So that's where we are. And we have a good relationship with the [MVNO] (ph) customers, and we have many of them, and it will continue. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Look, I mean the \u2013 it is very profitable business, as Hans said and is a great contribution to revenue and EBITDA consistent with the strategy to monetize the network, and we are very comfortable with the arrangements we have, but that's as far as we can go.\nWalter Piecyk: Can I just pivot and just -- then just ask one related but kind of high level question. There has been some reports of T-Mobile doing some additional fiber asset joint partnerships. If the administration changes, maybe there's opportunities for some additional vertical integration. But I guess the big question is, at least for me, how important is it in the long-term for you to have a vertical solution for customers, meaning that the consumer can buy their home broadband and their wireless services from you or -- and if you're not doing that obviously, outside of the Fios markets, is that a risk if others put together that vertical solution?\nHans Vestberg: We are well positioned in that area. And again if the market go convergence between mobility and broadband, we will be there to serve our customers either with Fios and fixed wireless access. And right now, that's working really good for us. So we are happy with our assets we have and how we're deploying them right now. We're looking into how we can continue to meet our customer demands. And now we also launched, as you saw in the quarter on the consumer side, myHome where we have all the benefits we had from myPlan. We are moving over to myHome. I feel good about what our consumer division is doing on broadband and mobility at the moment with the product. We are Number One in the market, so we just need to continue to keep the lead and continue to keep innovating, and I feel good about the consumer team doing that.\nWalter Piecyk: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Walt. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam McHugh of BNP Paribas. Your line is open sir.\nSam McHugh: Good morning guys. Two quick questions. In the last few years, you've gone through quite a big reinvestment phase, I guess in the consumer division with the launch of myPlan, the refresh of the brand this quarter. As we look out kind of the next two or three years and take a big step back, should we think you are now at a place where EBITDA can sustainably grow ahead of service revenues? Yes, that's question one. And the second part just a clarification. Tony, you mentioned something about 2H wireless service revenue trends versus the first half. If you wouldn't mind just repeating it, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: When it comes to continue to have leverage on our EBITDA together with our service revenue, I think it is clear for us that the KPIs that we are measured on as a management team and me, myself is on the growth on the service revenue, wireless service revenue expansion as well as EBITDA and cash flow. And that's how we are working holistically. So yes, we -- our goal is to see that we have the leverage on our service revenue growth right now. We have great products. We work with efficiency. There are of course, pressures in our business as and the business, but that's what we strive for. But we don't guide for '25 or something like that at this moment, we will come back on that. But our work and our KPIs are set up for that. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Thanks. Hi, Sam. So on the service revenue for the second half, what we said is we expect to see sequential growth in service revenue in the second half. And when we talked about the assumptions that we had in the guide, we said, look we had pricing actions that we've already taken and you see that well over $1 billion. We also said we have an improving volume profile in consumer and you see that progress. Fixed wireless access continues to scale. And we have over $500 million now in fixed wireless access revenue on a run rate of over $2 billion and that base of business continues to grow. We also said we had headwinds in prepaid, and that's improving, and we will see that improving as time goes on and then from our amortization. And the promo discipline continues to be encouraging, and we say we see a similar level year-over-year. So those assumptions haven't changed and we feel really good about the performance on service revenue, and the momentum we have in the business heading into the second half.\nSam McHugh: Awesome thanks.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks Sam. Brad, we have time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir.\nBryan Kraft: Thanks good morning. I have one for Tony and one for Hans. Tony, regarding free cash flow, it's up, I think, about 12% year-over-year in the first half. do you anticipate being able to grow free cash flow this year? Or is the year-to-date growth we've seen more a function of favorable timing in the first half with higher CapEx and working capital usage coming in the second half? And then Hans, you had talked quite a bit about Verizon's strong position for AI and enterprise. Is there anything you can share on what you're seeing in 5G enterprise adoption and also on the sales pipeline activity that you are seeing? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I'll start with the first one, and then I can hand it over to Tony on the cash flow. Yes, what we see is private networks continue to grow in volume and -- which is a prelude, you start with the private network then you start adding on applications on it. And of course ultimately, you put in mobile edge compute. We have all that set up since 2018, 2019, and we start seeing more and more business case for logistics centers, for factories, et cetera where we can do it. And then GenAI will only sort of capitalize that and do it even faster. That is going to take some time because right now, many corporation enterprises are in the learning process, meaning they are training their data sets. So it is going to take some time. But I don't think that anyone is even close to be as well-positioned as we are in GenAI and the [GenAI economy] (ph), both for taking advantage of it efficiency-wise, internally but definitely from a revenue point of view over time.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks. Hi Bryan. So on free cash flow, overall the cash generation of the business continues to be very strong. In the first half of the year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up 7% and we were able to grow cash flow in the second quarter, even with an incremental $1.7 billion in cash taxes. And as we said in April, we expect free cash flow to have a similar shape to last year and build throughout the year. And we still see the same puts and takes on free cash flow for the full year, as we described back in January. And within that framework, we see slightly more incremental pressure from cash taxes. And offsetting that is the lower upgrades, and we'll have to see where that goes. But overall, the strong position and cash flow puts us in a position to pay down debt in the second half of 2024, and we are on track to do so.\nBryan Kraft: Thanks very much.\nBrady Connor: Great. Brad that\u2019s all the time we have for today.\nOperator: This concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady. Good morning and welcome to Verizon's second quarter 2024 earnings call. This quarter marks the beginning of Verizon's next chapter. We have launched a comprehensive brand refresh that goes far beyond the new logo. This transformation embodies our commitment to bringing choice, value, and control to our customers' lives, reflecting our evolution and vision for the future of connectivity. We refreshed our brand as our strategy continues to deliver strong results. The three pillars of our performance, wireless service revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, expansion and increased free cash flow remain solid, showing both sequential and year-over-year improvements. In the second quarter, we saw wireless service revenue climb 3.5% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA rise by 2.8%, and free cash flow increased 3% compared to last year. Our improving operations and results build on our first quarter momentum, keep us on track to meet our 2024 financial guidance and are paving the way for a sustained growth. Our progress comes from innovation that deeply resonates with customers, including the most personalized offerings in the industry. These initiatives align perfectly with our core strategy to strengthen and grow customer relationships while delivering the best return on invested capital. We launched myPlan in 2023 and it delighted our customers. In just over a year, over 30% of our subscribers are using it. That is an incredible adoption rate and now we're bringing these features to Home Internet with myHome. We're building and expanding on our strengths and successes and you can expect that to continue. For businesses we launched Verizon Business Complete, the industry's only end-to-end smartphone management system. We cover everything from selecting the first phone to upgrades with 24-hour service and same-day equipment replacement. These initiatives, combined with our strong network performance and extensive distribution, are reinforcing our leadership position and driving our industry forward. Turning to the second quarter. We had a strong operational performance across mobility, broadband and our network. Our overall execution in consumer mobility has been improving quarter-after-quarter since early last year and our momentum continues. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds are up 12% year-over-year, which is amazing. Total postpaid phone net adds of 148,000 is a big improvement year-over-year and sequentially, and we expect to have positive postpaid phone net adds in consumer for the year. Choice is at the core of our approach, and we're constantly working on new partnerships that give our customers more options and value. One example is our addition of YouTube Premium and Peacock subscriptions which makes us the only provider offering our customers savings on 10 of the top streaming services. These content partnerships give our customers compelling reasons to shop with us. We also had a very strong quarter for postpaid phone net adds in Verizon Business at 156,000. This is a sharp improvement from the first quarter and shows how important we are to small, mid-sized and large businesses. Our business customers continue to invest in mobility and we offer them the widest range of choices. In the consumer value market, we are applying the same customer-centric discipline and rigor as we do in the post-paid market and are seeing significant net add improvements excluding SafeLink. We recently relaunched Total by Verizon as Total Wireless and enhanced our offerings with price guarantees, upgrade credits and other features. In broadband, we're still taking share with 391,000 net adds in the second quarter. Fixed wireless access remains a key driver with higher net adds than in the first quarter. We continue to grow our broadband base ending the quarter with more than 11.5 million broadband subscribers. We're also continuing to add business from large customers like government agencies. We're very proud that we were awarded a new contract from the U.S. Department of the Navy to provide wireless devices and device management building on our previous work together. For first responders, Verizon frontline delivers mission-critical connectivity and advanced solution to more than 40,000 public safety agencies across the United States, serving them with everything from device and network management to digital transformation. Verizon is there when people need us most from protecting the front-lines to natural disaster response. In fact, recent FCC data show us that overall our network outperformed our peers in areas affected by the Hurricane Beryl. I could not be proud of that. It's one of the reasons we're so committed to the network superiority and we're continuing to expand C-Band in suburban and rural areas. Our initial C-Band markets outperform with better gross add growth, higher uptake of premium services, and lower churn. We now have nearly half of our network traffic running on ultra-wideband, up from 36% a year ago. That number will continue to grow as we expand C-band reach. We're also working to enhance our network coverage by partnering with AST SpaceMobile to provide satellite to device connectivity using the 850 megahertz spectrum. This will bring our network to unserved communities, as we target 100% coverage from coast to coast. Our portfolio of high performance spectrum, the capacity of our fiber and our ability to deploy and support mobile edge compute, make us as the backbone of the AI economy and the partner of choice for players in the space. We will power the best AI services for our customers. What set us apart with AI is our network's mobile edge computing capabilities and deep fiber footprint. By processing data closer to the source, we enable real-time AI application that requires security, ultra-low latency, and high bandwidth. This is where our network shines, opening up possibilities that simply weren't feasible before. We're already seeing the benefits of AI in our operations. For example, we use AI to route customer support calls to agents best-suited to help. We analyze more than 800 data points per call to save our customers time and spare them frustration. It takes the best network to power these applications and today RootMetrics awarded us an outright win for national overall wireless network performance. Verizon also won the most national, state, and metro awards, including outright wins for accessibility, data performance, and streaming video performance. This is a kind of superior network performance that our customers deserve and expect from us. I'm pleased with our first half-year performance on how well our team is executing our strategy. I always say there's more work to do and there always is. We are seeing improving postpaid phone net adds in consumer, performing extremely well in business and taking share in broadband. We are achieving growth in a disciplined, balanced way and have built great momentum heading into the second half of the year and into 2025. Now I would hand over the call to Tony for a deeper dive into our performance. Thank you, Tony. Our focus for the second half of the year remains clear to drive growth in wireless service revenue, expand adjusted EBITDA and generate strong free cash flow. We are evolving our broadband strategy as we approach 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers, and we'll continue to scale the business along with the private networks while driving mobility growth. Our ongoing C-band expansion will be crucial in supporting these efforts, enhancing our network performance and opening new opportunities across markets. Our commitment to a differentiated customer experience and operational excellence remains firm. The success of myPlan and our brand refresh are proof of our ability to meet evolving customer needs. We will build on these successes in the quarters ahead, as we work to deliver value to all of our stakeholders. We will continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities by investing in the business, supporting our dividend and paying down debt. As AI continues to reshape our industry, Verizon is well-positioned to enable and benefit from it. Our reliable, secure and powerful network will be at the forefront of AI and mobile edge compute applications. This is an exciting time for us at Verizon. Mobility, broadband and cloud, our essential services and their value has never been higher. We power and empower how people live, work and play. We are in a great business and there's so much more to come. We have the right assets and the strategy in place for success this year and beyond. I'm more excited than ever about what lies ahead of us. Now Brady, we are ready to take questions. Thanks, John. On the ACP, Tony will give you the details. But yes, we had some impact on the prepaid brand as was expected, and also a little bit on Fios. Looking forward I see this is a great opportunity. I mean 21 million people having ACP and the importance of mobility and broadband today is so important. And our offerings, but all the way from broadband with Verizon forward, fixed wireless access, both very efficient and then on the prepaid brands. So I see that as an opportunity going forward, but some slight impact on volumes this quarter. On the upgrades, as you have seen the upgrades has been a little bit low for a while. It is two things. First of all, the quality of the phones has continued to go up. But secondly, I think even more important is the discipline that we have shown over the years right now, I think for the last 1.5 years, how we do the promotions, how we look at the customer investment bucket and see that we are actually distributing our money. We are going to see what's going to happen in this cycle. I don't feel very worried about it. I feel that we are in a great position to handle it, and it's all in our guide what we are expecting. So I don't see any major things happening here. Tony? Thank you Simon. On fixed wireless access, you are rightfully say it. We have good momentum came into this quarter with 378,000 new net adds on fixed wireless access doing strong, both on consumer, as well as on a business. And we are now expanding our C-band to suburban and rural, which is another type of opportunity, less penetrated, but also more vastly distributed. So we are gearing for getting to our target between 4 million and 5 million fixed wireless access broadband customers. And as soon as we get there as I've said before, I will come back and see how we see the opportunity going forward. But clearly, we have a great network that can ingest more customers over time. But let me come back on the exact details of that when we reach the target. On the towers, I mean, or any rumor I wouldn't comment on any rumor. What you should know is that Tony and I are very committed to improve our cash flow, whatever we can see to see that we optimize our assets, we will do that but I have no comments or rumors in the market. But the focus on cash flow is extremely important because it goes straight into our capital priorities. That's why we've been so focused on for the last couple of years, and we did yet again in this quarter, good progress on them. So on the broadband, I think again, we are between 375,000 to 400,000 net adds in broadband this quarter, been it for quite a while. So we see it as a very healthy. I think also we have a really good offering. And now with myHome that we just announced, I think we are going to be even stronger on it. So we see it healthy. Of course, Fios is by far the best fiber product in the market. And then fixed wireless access, the differentiation of the product, how we deploy it, how the customer provision it so different. And with all the streaming agreements we have right now, we can scale that horizontally to all our customers. So I see it is a very healthy business for us today. When it comes to our capacity on fixed wireless access -- yet again, I mean as we said, less than -- around 50% of all the traffic is now on C-band. So we have a way to go and we have deployed only a portion. So as we deploy more, we of course open up more opportunities. Finally, and maybe Tony has some addition. On the volume growth, I'm excited of what we have done in the consumer side with myPlan, and all the new innovations were done with our customers, and we see it resonate with the market. And clearly, quarter-by-quarter, we have improved both our revenue but also operation volumes on postpaid. Prepaid you saw it yourself, a big step forward on prepaid this quarter. And then our business side, I mean Kyle and the team has been now for I'm not sure how many quarters been around 125, up to 150 net adds on wireless. So all-in-all, I see that with the offerings that we put into the market, the refresh of the brand that is supporting that we are in a good position going into the second half of this year. Tony, any additions to that? Thank you. I'll start and Tony will give you the details. As we said before, I mean the second-line offering is straight into our strategy. The strategy is to build the network ones and have as many profitable connections on top of it in order to get the best return on invested capital. And you can see that is really happening, and that's been a very big focus for us. Tony will give you some more details on how it looks in the second half here. On the programs of cost, we put in last year a couple of really large programs all the way from agreement with HL together with large customer care changes. Many of those are now coming into the base, and that's why you see the leverage. But we also have quite a lot of new things coming up. And as you rightfully mentioned, we have a voluntary separation program that is ongoing right now. We also have all the efficiencies with AI that is coming through. And of course we continue with our disciplined approach on investments. So all-in-all, there is more things to come. And -- but we have gotten leverage from some of the things we did last year, Tony. Thank you Mike. I think in general, when we see the value accretion we have done recently, very much about new offerings to see that our customers are getting more value from the offerings we have. We have done some price adjustments historically. I think that Sampath in the consumer side has said that he would get better balance between volume and value increases. So that's what you see right now. And then on the business side, we have constantly done a great job. I mean Kyle and his team has constantly continue with a really high market share, continue to gain in every area like government, large enterprise and SMBs. So in the quarter you saw that the offerings we're doing with myHome and the additions on myPlan. And of course, with also the new offerings in business, Business Complete which is a new way to serve our SMBs. All of them are accretive and value but also giving our customers better services. So that's how we continue to work. And we are in sort of the third-phase of wireless where wireless is so important for our customers, and we see it also as an opportunity with the largest direct-to-consumer business in the country to actually add support with them with new services and layering on. Tony? Hi, David. Good morning. So look as we said before, finding the right balance of P&Q. And I think you've heard Sampath and I talk about something like 80-20 price-volume mix last year was more like 100, so clearly making progress on that. And keep in mind, we have a very high-quality customer base, and we see it in the results quarter-after-quarter. And I think you see the momentum in both gross adds and in net adds in the quarter, and it is very high-quality growth, both on the consumer and the business side. Business had a very strong quarter as well on volumes. And you also see the growth in fixed wireless access. We did 378,000 fixed wireless access net adds that continue to provide a tailwind to service revenue. So we are trying to find that right balance of P&Q, and I think the results reflect that. Hi, Peter. When it comes to our capital allocation priorities, they haven't changed. I mean first of all, we put the money in the business. And this year, we have the guide between [$17 billion and $17.5 billion] (ph). So -- but of course, if we see opportunities to gain more revenue and grow business, we will always look into the business side. Secondly, the dividend is very important. I mean we have now been growing our dividend for 17 consecutive quarters. And Tony and my job of -- years, not quarters. And Tony and I are committed to continue to put the Board in a position to do that. And you see on our pay ratio, we're well inside that ratio doing well. And then we're paying down our debt. We paid down debt this quarter. Second half, we're going to continue with that. We will not consider any conversation about buybacks until we get to 225. And after that there is a lot of factors in the market, the priorities but also where is the interest rates, where is share price and all of that. So let us focus on the priority in the order we have said, and that's how we are going to continue for the next foreseeable future. Thank you, Craig. I don't have the exact number, but I know that we have a fair amount of new phones, of course in the base because with our high quality customer base on postpaid, many of our customers are already on later versions of the iPhones. Again looking into this cycle, I mean, -- of course, we are going to see some excitement around AI. I don't think that it is going to be any particular at this time. It will be over time, maybe. We have a very disciplined model when it comes to a approach expectations for promotion, et cetera. We will stick to that. we believe that we have such a great network, great offerings. So we can actually manage that, and we will continue to do so. And then talking about the AI. I mean I think where I'm most excited is, of course that we have built sort of the Verizon Intelligent edge network which will be the platform for the GenAI economy because you are going to have to have a lot more compute storage at the edge of the network, and that's how we built the network already 2018 with fiber to all our main hubs and between our main subcenters. And then on top of that, we have cooling and power at those edges. And I think as we go from the LLMs and we go into sort of doing commercial products for enterprises. Our network is set up for that. And so I'm very excited for that opportunity going forward together with private networks. So \u2013 there is a lot of things coming into GenAI devices, our efficiencies but also a business opportunity for us when it comes to AI. On the mobile convergence fixed mobile convergence, we see some uptick on that. As I said before, we will follow the customers. We have all these economics on wireless and on broadband. And we will see that if our customer wants to have a converged product, we will do that. I don't believe in sort of discounting products to get there. But of course, our efficiency if one customer has both mobility and broadband from us, and we will see that we share that with our customers as an opportunity. So I don't think we are going to see the European levels here because of the nature of the market. But as we move further into convergence, we will be very well positioned with the products we have. Tony, on the leverage? On the C-band, you are right. We almost have now 50% of our traffic on the C-band, but we still have some deployment to be done in suburban and rural. Many of those sites are prepared for it, so we are just rolling out as we speak right now. So we are going to see that continue. Joe and his team in technology, very much focused on customer satisfaction when it comes to the rollout and revenue generation right now. That's the main focus we have at Verizon. And the same trend as we saw in the beginning where we have better upgrades, lower churn, whereas C-band and of course also getting fixed wireless access opportunity. The same goes for where we are enhancing or continuing to new areas. Secondly you asked about all the new features coming into 5G advance with SA, Massive MIMO, all of that is just expanding our capacity and bringing even more opportunities for us for revenue and seeing that we create the customer expectations on the best network in the nation. So -- and that's just -- we're just in the beginning of that. So I'm very pleased with what I see. The team is running as fast as we can and we get good feedback on C-band. Tony? We can do mobile edge compute without SA. We have done that for five years. Then there are some efficiencies on especially private networks and deployment with SA. But again, you need a full ecosystem all the way from the devices and the network features and the core in order to do that. So it is a little bit of a holistic thinking again when we work it, but we can already deliver that right now. When it comes to GenAI in mobile edge compute, that -- we don't have that to our customers right now. But the conversation with many of both the cloud players as well as enterprises of doing that when they have commercial products, and not only training large language modules. And that's how we designed our network. So that's why I'm excited of it. At the same time, we already have four GenAI products in the market that is deployed on 40,000 agents to all our stores, et cetera personalization, more efficiency for customer and employee experience. And we see a great opportunity for that. So there are multiple opportunities with AI for us and we have been on to it for a long time. I don't have any comments on the quarter on the numbers. We try to have our Chinese [Walls] (ph) here, so I don't have it. But in general, we see these partnership has imported enterprise customers. And it goes back to the strategy we have, meaning we build the network once. And we have -- want to have as many profitable connections on top of the network in order to get the best return on invested capital. So that's where we are. And we have a good relationship with the [MVNO] (ph) customers, and we have many of them, and it will continue. Tony? We are well positioned in that area. And again if the market go convergence between mobility and broadband, we will be there to serve our customers either with Fios and fixed wireless access. And right now, that's working really good for us. So we are happy with our assets we have and how we're deploying them right now. We're looking into how we can continue to meet our customer demands. And now we also launched, as you saw in the quarter on the consumer side, myHome where we have all the benefits we had from myPlan. We are moving over to myHome. I feel good about what our consumer division is doing on broadband and mobility at the moment with the product. We are Number One in the market, so we just need to continue to keep the lead and continue to keep innovating, and I feel good about the consumer team doing that. When it comes to continue to have leverage on our EBITDA together with our service revenue, I think it is clear for us that the KPIs that we are measured on as a management team and me, myself is on the growth on the service revenue, wireless service revenue expansion as well as EBITDA and cash flow. And that's how we are working holistically. So yes, we -- our goal is to see that we have the leverage on our service revenue growth right now. We have great products. We work with efficiency. There are of course, pressures in our business as and the business, but that's what we strive for. But we don't guide for '25 or something like that at this moment, we will come back on that. But our work and our KPIs are set up for that. Tony? I'll start with the first one, and then I can hand it over to Tony on the cash flow. Yes, what we see is private networks continue to grow in volume and -- which is a prelude, you start with the private network then you start adding on applications on it. And of course ultimately, you put in mobile edge compute. We have all that set up since 2018, 2019, and we start seeing more and more business case for logistics centers, for factories, et cetera where we can do it. And then GenAI will only sort of capitalize that and do it even faster. That is going to take some time because right now, many corporation enterprises are in the learning process, meaning they are training their data sets. So it is going to take some time. But I don't think that anyone is even close to be as well-positioned as we are in GenAI and the [GenAI economy] (ph), both for taking advantage of it efficiency-wise, internally but definitely from a revenue point of view over time."

            "name": "Tony Skiadas",
            "content": "Thanks Hans and good morning. Our second quarter results reflected accelerated growth in wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as we continue to generate strong free cash flow. These results were driven by strong operational execution in both consumer and business, which led to sequential net add improvements in postpaid phones, fixed wireless access, and prepaid excluding SafeLink. Within consumer, postpaid phone gross adds were approximately 1.8 million in the second quarter, a 12% year-over-year increase. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth. Excluding our second number offering, consumer post-paid phone gross adds grew 5% year-over-year. Consumer post-paid phone churn was 0.79% in the second quarter, up slightly from the prior year period. This was in-line with our expectations as we recently implemented several price increases that are expected to generate well over $1 billion in annualized wireless service revenue. We believe the majority of the pricing churn is now behind us and we continue to expect full-year consumer postpaid phone churn to be flat or slightly better than last year. Consumer postpaid phone net losses were 8,000 for the second quarter, which marks a significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. For the full year, we expect to deliver positive consumer postpaid phone net adds without the contribution from our second number offering. Moving to prepaid, we continue to make progress with our core brands while navigating the conclusion of the ACP program. Overall prepaid net losses were 624,000, including 410,000 losses related to the ACP shutdown, the vast majority of which are in our SafeLink brand. Excluding SafeLink, prepaid net losses were 12,000, a substantial improvement compared to the prior year period. Visible and total wireless continue to expand and perform well, while our operational execution with Straight Talk continues to improve. We exited the quarter with good momentum and prepaid, setting the stage for a stronger performance in the second half of 2024 and positioning us well for 2025. On the business side, postpaid phone net adds were 156,000 in the second quarter, the best performance in the last six quarters. We saw a strong sequential improvement of phone net adds across small and medium businesses, as well as enterprise and public sector customers. Turning to broadband, our total broadband net additions were 391,000 for the quarter, representing the eighth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 broadband net adds. In fixed wireless access, we continue to focus on building a long-term sustainable business. Total fixed wireless net adds were 378,000 in the quarter, up sequentially. This brings our base above 3.8 million subscribers, up nearly 69% year-over-year. Consumer fixed wireless net adds were 218,000, a 15,000 sequential increase as we continue to see healthy demand for reliable broadband even in a seasonally softer quarter. Verizon business continued strong execution with 160,000 fixed wireless access net adds, a quarterly record. Demand for the service is strengthening as small businesses and enterprises continue to trust the reliability of the product and speed and ease of deployment. Overall, Fios Internet net adds totaled 28,000 for the quarter. We are pleased with the continuous growth of Fios, even with the effects of the ACP shutdown and lower move activity. We ended the quarter with over 11.5 million broadband subscribers, a 17% increase from a year ago. Our broadband growth continues to significantly outpace that of the broader market, given our superior network experience and strong execution. Moving to the financials, we delivered another solid quarter and remain on track to meet our full year financial guidance. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter totaled $32.8 billion, a 0.6% increase year-over-year. That growth was driven by service and other revenue which grew 1.8% year-over-year, partially offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue, as total upgrades were down nearly 13% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue totaled $19.8 billion, a sequential increase of more than $250 million, and year-over-year growth of 3.5% or $660 million. The increase was primarily driven by consumer wireless service revenue, which grew 3.7% year-over-year to $16.3 billion. Consumer postpaid ARPA grew 5% year-over-year, reflecting the benefits of pricing actions and fixed wireless growth. In addition, myPlan helps to drive ARPA growth through premium mix adoption and [Perk] (ph) revenue. As Hans said, we now have over 30% of our consumer phone lines on myPlan and expect this to expand meaningfully going forward. FWA revenue which is included in wireless service revenue was $514 million for the quarter, up more than $200 million versus the prior year period. Launched at scale in 2021, our FWA business is expected to generate more than $2 billion in revenue this year with prospects for continued healthy growth. Prepaid revenue for the quarter declined $162 million versus the prior year period. The headwind to wireless service revenue growth from the ACP shutdown was approximately 30 basis points within the range we provided last quarter, and the margin impact was insignificant. With the majority of ACP disconnects now behind us and the momentum growing in our core prepaid brand, we are better positioned for the remainder of the year and heading into 2025. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $12.3 billion an increase of 2.8% year-over-year. The improved operating leverage reflects the lower upgrade activity and our disciplined approach to growth. We are making progress in our ongoing cost efficiency program and recently introduced new measures to improve our operating efficiency, including a voluntary separation program announced in June. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.15, down 5% compared to the prior year period. Growth in adjusted EBITDA was offset by below-the-line items, including higher interest expense, predominantly due to lower capitalized interest as we put more C-band spectrum into service. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $16.6 billion for the first half of the year compared to $18 billion in the prior year period. The results reflect higher cash taxes of approximately $1.7 billion, predominantly due to the unwind of bonus depreciation, as well as higher interest expense primarily driven by the decrease in capitalized interest. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $8.1 billion. This was $2 billion less than the same period last year as we have returned to historical levels of capital intensity. The network build remains ahead of schedule with C-band deployed on nearly 60% of our planned sites. Our full year guidance for CapEx spending remains unchanged at a range of $17 billion to $17.5 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $8.5 billion for the first half of 2024. This represents an increase of nearly 7% or approximately $550 million from the prior year period, despite higher cash taxes and interest expense. We expect to generate strong cash flow in the back half of the year that will support paying down debt. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $122.8 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the previous quarter and $3.7 billion lower year-over-year. Our net unsecured debt to a consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times, an improvement from 2.6 times last quarter. The strength of our results and momentum in our business put us in a great position to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In particular, we remain on track to further reduce the leverage on our balance sheet in the second half of the year. In summary with 2024, reaching its midpoint, the team's strong execution and operating momentum is translating into results. We have good momentum in mobility as reflected by the strong gross add growth and continue to take share in broadband through fixed wireless access and Fios. Importantly, we are accomplishing this with a disciplined approach, balancing growth and profitability providing the confidence to deliver on our 2024 financial guidance. With that, I will turn it back to Hans for his final remarks before opening the call to your questions. Yeah, thanks. Good morning John. In terms of ACP updates, let me give you a couple of things here. So as we said previously, the majority of the ACP exposure is in our prepaid business. And as we said last time, we had about 1.1 million prepaid subs that benefited from the ACP program. In the quarter -- in the second quarter, we saw about 400,000 prepaid disconnects. This is the vast majority of what we expected. There is minimal impact on the postpaid side as I think was part of your question. We saw some pressure in Fios in terms of gross add opportunity. If we look ahead in the third quarter, we expect some disconnects in prepaid and a small number across other products. In terms of revenue, we also said that any impact that we would see we'd see on service revenue up to 50 basis points of headwind and we're tracking inside of that number right now. And even with the disconnects, the margin exposure from ACP was insignificant in the second quarter. So we will continue to keep everyone updated as we progress here. Yeah. Thanks, Hans. So very comfortable with the revenue guide for the year. As Hans said, the performance and execution is very much on track, and we continue to find a better balance of P&Q. And you see the progress on volumes, as Hans said, B2 mobility and SWA. And maybe just a few additional points to consider. First we expect to see sequential growth in service revenue in the second half of the year. Also, I would say the year-over-year comps are a little more challenging in the second half as we lap the pricing changes from 2023. The wildcard obviously, is the promotional environment and the level of upgrades we'll have to see where that goes. But having said all that, the assumptions that we have in the service revenue guide have not changed. So overall, we feel good about our revenue performance and the momentum in the business, and we're not going to guide on '25 at this time, but I would tell you that those assumptions will carry forward as well. Thanks. Hi, Sebastiano. On the second number, just a few points, Hans touched on this upfront, but this is a great business. We are providing customers options and flexibility. It is a very profitable connection and we would do it every day of the week. In terms of the market for this, we'll see how the TAM evolves. We shared the gross add impact you can assume some level of churn in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect less of a contribution from second number in the back half of the year. It is high-margin business comparable to ARPU [add-a-line] (ph) offerings. The ARPU is very good and very comparable to add-a-line, without the device subsidy. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive phone net adds in consumer for the year without the contribution from second number. And the results in the quarter reflect the strength of our core business. And then on your question on EBITDA and cost transformation, we're very comfortable with the EBITDA guide. We made a lot of progress. You saw the 80 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. And the program in terms of delivering cost transformation is on track. Hans talked about some of the work we are doing, and we did last year with customer care and with managed services. We have a lot of work going on right now between IT and real estate, and network decommissioning. In addition, Hans mentioned the voluntary separation program. And some of that savings will start manifesting in the back end of this year and into 2025. And then lastly AI is an enabler of efficiencies. You can think about customer care, you can think about the personalization with myPlan. And we see efficiencies coming from there as well. But we're very much on track. We are operating differently. And we feel good about the progress on cost actions that are driving the improvements in EBITDA that you see in the first half of the year. Yes. Just a couple of other things to add. I mean as we said upfront, we said we need to find a better balance of P&Q in 2024, and we are doing that. We are very confident, Mike in our back book. We've been very consistent, as Hans said, about evaluating pricing opportunities, aligning the price with the value proposition for customers. We did take pricing actions in the first half of the year that provide a good tailwind to service revenue, and those pricing actions were contemplated in the guide, but it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on what we might do in the future. Yes. So Frank, on the leverage metric, the long-term goal is 1.75 to 2 on the unsecured. And then we said we would consider buybacks when we got to 2.25, again unsecured. Yes. Thanks, Hans. So just a couple of other points. On C-band, we are seeing good improvements in churn 3 basis points. On gross adds, we see about 9 basis points gross add strength. And as we deploy suburban and rural gross adds are up threefold in those markets. And then premium mix continues to be stronger as well of about 10%. And we do have now at this point nearly 60% of our planned sites are now deployed with C-band. So really making really good progress. Sure. Hi Walt. So a couple of things. We announced the program in early June for a portion of our workforce. The process is not going to be fully completed until the back end of August. So I don't have numbers at this point. It was contemplated in their full year guide. And we do expect to see savings towards the back end of 2024 and into 2025, and we'll come back with disclosures on the program once it is finalized. We'll file an 8-K similar to how we did it last time. Yes. Look, I mean the \u2013 it is very profitable business, as Hans said and is a great contribution to revenue and EBITDA consistent with the strategy to monetize the network, and we are very comfortable with the arrangements we have, but that's as far as we can go. Thanks. Hi, Sam. So on the service revenue for the second half, what we said is we expect to see sequential growth in service revenue in the second half. And when we talked about the assumptions that we had in the guide, we said, look we had pricing actions that we've already taken and you see that well over $1 billion. We also said we have an improving volume profile in consumer and you see that progress. Fixed wireless access continues to scale. And we have over $500 million now in fixed wireless access revenue on a run rate of over $2 billion and that base of business continues to grow. We also said we had headwinds in prepaid, and that's improving, and we will see that improving as time goes on and then from our amortization. And the promo discipline continues to be encouraging, and we say we see a similar level year-over-year. So those assumptions haven't changed and we feel really good about the performance on service revenue, and the momentum we have in the business heading into the second half. Thanks. Hi Bryan. So on free cash flow, overall the cash generation of the business continues to be very strong. In the first half of the year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up 7% and we were able to grow cash flow in the second quarter, even with an incremental $1.7 billion in cash taxes. And as we said in April, we expect free cash flow to have a similar shape to last year and build throughout the year. And we still see the same puts and takes on free cash flow for the full year, as we described back in January. And within that framework, we see slightly more incremental pressure from cash taxes. And offsetting that is the lower upgrades, and we'll have to see where that goes. But overall, the strong position and cash flow puts us in a position to pay down debt in the second half of 2024, and we are on track to do so."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our investor relations website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our investor relations website a detailed review of our first quarter results. You'll find additional details in the earnings materials on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we have started the year with a solid momentum, building on the progress we made throughout 2023. Our results this quarter further validate that our strategy is working and position us well for a profitable growth this year. Our execution in the first quarter keeps us on track towards our full year 2024 guidance, as we continue to deliver against our key financial metrics. We grew Wireless Service revenue and adjusted EBITDA and generated solid free cash flow. Operational Excellence is our priority. Our team is delivering. We have the right strategy, and we're working to keep this progress up quarter-by-quarter. It has been a busy quarter across our business. We produced big moments at the Super Bowl. Published our first consumer connections report, achieved milestones in our C-band rollout, added new members to our leadership team, published our annual ESG report, accomplished many goals with Citizen Verizon and completed a pension transaction that increases our financial flexibility. Verizon has a differentiated position in the industry. We have the highest quality customer base in consumer and business, the largest adjusted EBITDA, and a great team that knows how to execute our strategy. Turning to our first quarter results, Wireless Service revenue growth climbed to 3.3%. Our revenue performance combined with our work on cost efficiency programs translated to a $12.1 billion adjusted EBITDA, that's a year-over-year growth of 1.4%. We generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow and we expect free cash flow to build throughout the year, similar to 2023. Our core products on mobility, broadband and private networks are at the center of people's lives and businesses. Connectivity is only becoming more vital with each passing day, and our investments and world-class network ensure that our customers can depend on us to deliver the reliable, high-quality experience they deserve. Now, let me go into some specifics about this quarter. Our consumer team is executing extremely well. Despite taking further pricing action this quarter, our postpaid phone net adds performance improved year-over-year, evidence of how our differentiated value proposition is resonating with customers. Our net loss of 158,000 is more than 100,000 net adds better than our first quarter performance in 2023. This achievement was fueled by continued momentum in postpaid phone gross adds, which grew more than 5% year-over-year. We mitigated churn impacts from pricing actions through laser-focused retention efforts and the strength of our value proposition. These results represented Verizon Consumer Group's strongest first quarter postpaid phone net adds performance since 2018. Our targeted and segmented go-to-market approach, combined with myPlan and its exclusive perks, is clearly working. With myPlan, we are building a recurring revenue stream out of perks and services. These incentives, like our popular Netflix plus Max bundle, add value and deepen our customer relationships. We know our customers extremely well and tailor our offerings to their needs. We're bringing the same proven approach to our prepaid business. Within the quarter, we established our new value market leadership team, bringing in experts to execute our plans with speed and discipline. While there is still work to be done, we're seeing early signs of progress, in Visible and Total By Verizon. In February, we stopped processing new affordable connectivity program activations, which caused headwinds for our SafeLink brand. The ACP may shut down, but Verizon is committed to providing households with access to high-quality connectivity and reliable home internet without data caps, and does not believe that income should be a barrier to access. Since 2020 we have offered high speed home internet to qualifying customers for as low as $20 a month through our Verizon forward program and we have other plans to reach households who rely on ACP. For business mobility, postpaid phone net adds were 90,000. The team continues to put up subscriber growth as a market share leader in a competitive environment even while implementing pricing actions within the quarter. More businesses rely on Verizon than any other provider to deliver mission-critical support for their day-to-day operations. In total, first quarter post-paid phone net losses were 68,000, a 59,000 net loss improvement versus prior year. We're exiting the quarter with both consumer and business delivering their strongest performance in March, a good sign for the year ahead. Our broadband business continues to be a key growth engine, now serving more than 11 million subscribers. We have grown our base 18% over the last year and our network is a critical part of the infrastructure that homes and businesses rely on. Fixed wireless access has turned out to be a large and growing opportunity. This is now a meaningful piece of our business. We knew that fixed wireless access would be a hit with consumers who like its quality, reliability and easy setup. Businesses are showing similar excitement as this was our biggest quarter-to-date for the net adds in business fixed wireless access with 151,000 setting our new high. Fios remains extremely popular, with one of the highest third-party net promoters scored in the industry. And as we already know, Fios is the best pure broadband offering in the country. Together, Our total broadband portfolio delivered a strong quarter with 389,000 net adds. As with mobility, we saw good momentum with the broadband net adds as we exited the quarter and we expect that to continue. We also had a great quarter in private networks, signing transformative deals across industries. Xerox selected our Network and Service solution as its framework for modernizing its information technology system. We also signed a new private network deal with the global power solution leader, Cummins Inc. And iconic American sport leagues are turning to us for the networks that serve their fans, players, and coaches. We're on the field, on the aisles, and in the stands, and in the parking lots. During the quarter, we held a partner summit where we unveiled our sports and entertainment strategy. We are at the center of the culture moments that matter the most to our customers, from concerts and performance to athletic achievements and competition. We're already in every National Football League stadium in the country. We're now expanding services with NFL teams, including the installation of a private 5G network at the L.A. Chargers Training facility. We also renewed our partnership as the official 5G network of the National Hockey League in the United States and are expanding services throughout its arenas. As you may have seen in our consumer connection report during the \u201823-\u201824 NFL season, the average fan used more data than the year before. These live moments matter to our customers and they want to share them by text, by phone and by video. We are a vital part of their experiences. Our private networks business is growing and full of long-term contracts with the best partners around the world. All of this is supported by the infrastructure we have built and are building. We operate the nation's most reliable and robust network for all customers from households to global enterprises. Recently, we passed 250 million POPs covered with C-Band, achieving our target almost a year ahead of plan. The pace and quality of our build out is spectacular. And most importantly, our customers love the C-band experience. In the first 76 markets where we rolled out C-band, we see a higher premium mix and reduced churn. Our strategy from the start was to build a network once, to meet the needs of the present, and to optimize it for the future, and we're doing just that. We have been working with AI for several years, and our powerful network position Verizon to lead the AI revolution. In 2023, we released a set of responsible AI principles to guide our efforts to leverage new AI technologies in ways that positively impact our stakeholders and establish Verizon, as a trusted brand and partner with respect to AI. Enabling AI at scale for improved customer service is a key. We're also aggressively driving AI transformative potential with our businesses, something our network was built to support. We already had several generative AI projects going live. Our AI strategy focuses on three priorities. First, optimizing internal processes and operations through machine learning, such as creating efficiencies in fuel consumption. AI is already centered to our cost transformation program and will become even more important over time. Secondly, enhancing product experiences with AI capabilities like the personalized plan recommendation on myPlan, which is producing good early results. And thirdly, establishing an AI-based revenue stream by commercializing our network's unique low latency, high bandwidth, and robust mobile edge compute capabilities. Generative AI workloads represent a great long-term opportunity for us. As we expand our network and increase our performance advantage, we're also making Verizon a more efficient organization. We are back to business as usual level on CapEx spend, as we had promised. And we have struck a balance between profitable growth and free cash flow that supports both our dividend and a stronger balance sheet. This gives us greater flexibility to accelerate deleveraging throughout the second half of the year, bringing us closer to our long-term leverage targets. Our dividend is healthy and secure, and our free cash flow dividend payout ratio continues to improve. We are focused on putting our board in a position to continue to raise the dividend each year, building on our current industry record of 17 consecutive increases. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial and operational performance in more detail. Tony.\nTony Skiadas : Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong execution of our team, building on the momentum from 2023 and delivering solid results in our three priorities of Wireless Service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. We saw further improvements in postpaid phone net adds and another strong quarter of growth in our broadband subscriber base. We accomplished this while maintaining our promotional discipline as evidenced by our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.4% and more than 16% year-over-year free cash flow growth. Consumer post-paid phone net losses were 158,000 for the quarter, better versus the prior year by 105,000, driven by improvements in both gross adds and churn. As Hans mentioned, this represents our best first quarter performance in consumer post-paid phone net adds since 2018. We continue to see improved operational performance with consumer post-paid phone gross adds up more than 5% year-over-year. And as you heard from Hans, we exited the quarter with good momentum. The changes we made over the last few quarters, including launching a regional sales structure and updating our sales compensation plans, provide the right framework for our go-to-market approach. We believe these changes, combined with the continued success of myPlan and increased utilization of C-band, will help us sustain our momentum. Consumer postpaid phone churn of 0.83% represents a 1 basis point improvement year-over-year. This result is a reflection of the strength of our value proposition, as well as our high quality customer base. The first quarter post-paid phone net add improvement coincided with a further decline in upgrades, which were down nearly 21% year-over-year. We continue to see success with our disciplined and segmented approach to customer offers in alignment with our strategy. On the business side, we delivered 90,000 postpaid phone net adds. Business volume results were challenged early in the quarter as the team implemented pricing increases in January. However, we saw positive net add momentum built throughout the quarter and we exited the quarter well positioned to continue to build on operational improvements in both mobility and broadband. That sales performance helped Verizon business achieve fixed wireless access net adds of 151,000, their best quarterly result to-date. We've been pleased with how businesses have adopted FWA and we continue to see strong demand from small businesses and enterprises which are attracted to the ease of deployment, reliability, and the flexibility of the product. Fixed wireless net adds for consumer were 203,000 resulting in a consolidated total of 354,000. This reflects the attractiveness of FWA as an alternative to traditional cable broadband, even in the market that saw muted activity. We continue to be comfortable with this pace of growth, believing it provides the right combination of base growth, ARPU accretion, and the superior experience our customers expect on the Verizon network. And our third-party Net Promoter Scores for our FWA product continue to outpace traditional cable broadband offerings, as we remain focused on building a long-term sustainable business. Overall, broadband net adds were 389,000, including 53,000 Fios Internet net adds. We're pleased with how Fios continues to grow in the marketplace, even as move activity across the country remains lower than prior years. We finished the quarter with over 11.1 million broadband subscribers, including over 3.4 million on FWA. We've now added more than 3 million broadband subscribers in the last two years alone. On prepaid, starting this quarter, we are disclosing subscriber results with and without our SafeLink brand. This disclosure provides improved transparency into our prepaid results. As a reminder, SafeLink is our government subsidy program brand offering and holds the majority of our ACP customers. The actions we've taken to scale Visible and Total by Verizon, as well as address operational execution with Straight Talk, drove improvements in our prepaid performance. Prepaid net losses excluding SafeLink were better by 146,000 year-over-year. While we are pleased to see the improvements, we still have work to do to address challenges in the prepaid business. That includes navigating the uncertainty around ACP, and we recently announced plans to provide accessible, affordable, and reliable connectivity options for those who need it most. As a reminder, we have approximately 1.1 million prepaid ACP subscribers as of the end of the first quarter. We expect the elimination of the program to result in lower wireless service revenue but have minimal impact on our adjusted EBITDA. Moving to our financials, consolidated revenue for the quarter was $33 billion, up 0.2% year-over-year. The benefits of the pricing actions we took in the quarter, combined with improved operating metrics, offset the year-over-year decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to lower upgrades. Wireless service revenue growth was 3.3% for the first quarter. This represents a significant acceleration in our revenue growth as the full year 2023 growth rate, excluding the reallocation of certain revenues, was only 1.3%. Consumer led the way with wireless service revenue growth of 3.4%, driven by ARPA growth of 4.4%, and improved year-over-year postpaid phone net add performance. In addition to targeted pricing actions, ARPA continues to benefit from the further adoption of myPlan. myPlan has been instrumental in growing our premium mix, which now stands at 42% of our postpaid phone base. We're also starting to see a growing impact from perk revenue as we scale the number of subscriptions. With over 20% of the postpaid base on myPlan, we see further opportunities for ARPA accretion as we expect to double the number of customers on myPlan in our postpaid base by the end of this year. For the first time, we are disclosing fixed wireless access revenue within our externally released results. FWA revenue, which is included in wireless service revenue, was $452 million for the quarter, up nearly $200 million versus the prior year. Headwinds in prepaid revenue continue to partially offset the gains from ARPA performance in wireless service revenue. For the quarter, prepaid revenue declined $106 million versus the prior year. While this is an improvement over the prior quarter, it represented an approximately 60 basis point drag on total wireless service revenue growth. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was approximately $12.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 1.4% compared to the prior year driven by the growth in wireless service revenue, as well as the impact of lower upgrade volumes. With a full quarter's impact from our recent pricing actions, we anticipate the second quarter's adjusted EBITDA growth to accelerate year-over-year. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items were down 0.5% year-over-year. Lower cost of equipment and cost of services were partially offset by an increase in SG&A. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.15, down 4.2% compared to the prior year, as gains in adjusted EBITDA were more than offset by higher interest expense, predominantly due to the lower capitalized interest, now that a large portion of the C-band spectrum licenses have been placed into service. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up over 16% or nearly $400 million from the first quarter of 2023. On a full year basis, nothing has changed. With free cash flow, we still expect the same puts and takes we shared with you in January. As Hans said, we expect free cash flow to build throughout the year, similar to 2023. Cash flow from operating activities came in at $7.1 billion. Within the quarter, we saw year-over-year pressures from higher interest expense, primarily related to the reduction in capitalized interest. We also made a discretionary pension contribution of $365 million prior to the closing of the retiree pension annuity transaction that we previously disclosed. CapEx for the quarter was $4.4 billion compared to $6 billion in the prior year as a result of our return to BAU levels of spend and historical levels of capital intensity. Our full year guidance of $17 billion to $17.5 billion in CapEx spending remains unchanged. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126 billion, a $3.7 billion improvement year-over-year, and a nearly $400 million improvement sequentially. During the quarter, we issued our sixth green bond for $1 billion with proceeds committed to fund additional renewable energy purchases. Net unsecured debt was also impacted by payments of approximately $270 million related to clearance of our C-band spectrum licenses, which are now substantially complete. While these payments do not affect our free cash flow, they are a use of cash. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times in-line with the previous quarter. Given the strength and momentum of our business, we continue to see a clear path to meaningfully delever the balance sheet in the second half of this year. In closing, I'm happy with our start to 2024, and our results from the first quarter set us up well to deliver on our financial guidance for the year. Our disciplined approach continues to put us in a strong position to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Our focus remains on driving operational improvements throughout the year. With that, I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before opening the call up for your questions.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Tony. I'm proud of our team and pleased with our financial and operational performance in the first quarter. We exited the quarter with good momentum across the business positioning us well for the year ahead. We're [scaling] (ph) fixed wireless access and private networks while growing our core mobility business. Our disciplined, targeted and segmented consumer strategy continues to prove itself. And we will apply the same level of energy and execution to the prepaid market. Network excellence drives our business forward and we will not let up on that. Our consistent network investment puts us in an unmatched position to deliver AI services at scale. Finally, our cash flow generation is solid. This shows that we are executing well against our financial objectives. Our cash flow strength allows us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, including supporting our dividend and paying down our debt. With strong momentum already in the start of the second quarter, I'm confident in our ability to sustain progress towards unlocking Verizon's full potential for all stakeholders. Now, Brady, we are ready to take questions.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir, please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much and good morning. Hans, maybe we can talk about the consumer a little bit. It was good to see the churn number. Perhaps you'd just talk a little bit about the impact of the pricing there. It seems like it had a drag on business but less of a drag on consumer. And just -- what are you seeing overall in the wireless market growth, it seems like the industry is continuing to grow, there's been some competitive moves by some of the cable companies recently, maybe just comment on the overall environment out there and your ability to sustain this, as well as the low upgrade rates. And then just a quick one, Tony, for you on cash flow. Thank you for the comments around the pacing through the year. Could you just talk about working capital and the impact this quarter? It seemed like there were some drags from that on the quarterly number. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Simon. Let me start with the consumer business. As we saw in the quarter, it was a little bit slow in the beginning of the quarter both for consumer and for business when it comes to wireless. But then I think we clearly see that our products are resonating with the customers. And on the consumer side, myPlan is really doing well. And as Tony said in the prepared remarks, the Perks is now coming up. Our premium is also increasing. So clearly, we see that. At the same time, the team has spent a lot of time to be disciplined both with promotions and churn management. And you saw we had the price up in the quarter on consumer that was pretty wide. But our team actually kept the churn down on the consumer side. I mean, it shows first of all how great our product is, but also see how well we're using the AI tools and all of that to see that our customers are getting the value and we are actually directing the money to the right customers. That's what you see coming out in the financial discipline in everything we're doing. Yeah, the promotions were lower again this quarter. But again, it's a way for us to segment the market to see that we have the right products. And that's what I've seen for quite a while right now on the consumer side. And what I said also is that -- we have said several times right now, we expect consumer to be positive net add this year. So they are doing it. And [Sampath] (ph) team probably have even more innovations coming. And when myPlan was one, the Perks and other, they have more things to come during the year. So I'm really excited about what we're doing on the wireless side. And of course competition is the same. There's nothing new, but it's the same as we've seen for quite a while. But we just performed way better. We have the right product, we have the right people, we have made the right changes in operation model and that's what we're seeing right now. And now we move all that into prepaid and you saw that we're also doing prepaid better but still we have more to be done. The team has their heads down, very focused on execution. Very pleased with what they've seen so far. That doesn't mean we're not going to push even harder going forward. Tony?\nTony Skiadas : Yeah, sure. So good morning, Simon. So a couple of points on churn. So the results on C-band are significantly better. We see, you know, strong churn performance, higher premium mix, and also higher gross adds in C-band markets. And, you know, overall in 2024, it's reasonable to expect similar or lower churn in the consumer business compared to 2023. And then on your cash flow question, in the prepared remarks, we said that free cash flow would have a similar shape to last year and build throughout the year. We do expect free cash flow to be up meaningfully in the second quarter. We still see the same puts and takes on free cash flow for the full year as we described in January. So nothing's really changed there. On your question on the quarter, let me start with operating cash flow and let me unpack that for you. So we saw the discretionary pension contribution in the quarter. That was $365 million in connection with the pension annuitization transaction that we announced in early March. As we said previously, the lower capitalized interest from C-band now manifests itself in operating cash flow, and that was about $300 million higher year-over-year. And the third point I'd make is, you know, we're funding the business for growth and very, very confident in our ability to execute and you saw that again. You saw the growth in the fourth quarter with strong gross adds and we followed that up with 5% gross add growth in the consumer business in the first quarter. And with that growth comes working capital timing that will settle in the second quarter. But overall we're very confident in the cash generation of the business and nonetheless we expect to generate strong free cash flow and we see no obstacles in paying down debt in a meaningful way in the second half of 2024.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot of Tony.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks Brad. We're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks and good morning, guys. First, just a couple of quick follow-ups on Simon's question. For number one, the positive commentary you guys talked about with March, does that suggest you guys could be positive in terms of consumer phone adds in the second quarter. That's number one. Number 2, the price increase seemed to be digested pretty well and you actually saw churn come down. Does that suggest you guys have more pricing power than you thought and we could see, and maybe not just for you but for the industry, and we could see more in the future that's number two. And then on ACP, I noticed you guys announced some new plans with free sort of low-end plans on the broadband side with free service for six months. You've talked about some of the headwinds as ACP goes away, but do you believe that there's an opportunity to potentially win some broadband subs as that plays out? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, John. On the first question there on consumer net adds in the short-term, I stay on my previous comment. Consumer net adds should be positive in 2024. The team is of course doing quite good right now. Actually 100,000 better in the first quarter here on net adds. Let them continue to execute. They have a great product that resonates with the market. And they will continue to execute well on that. On the churn side, I think first of all, I mean, if you look at the market, of course we see both inflation and -- a higher interest rate. But think about the product, first of all, so good right now. Everybody needs wireless and broadband. And I think that -- that has improved quite dramatically over the last couple of years. Secondly, our products right now are so well segmented for different segments, for different groups. And thirdly, we're laser focused \u2013 on churn management. The team with Sampath, the AI tools we have, so we actually spend on the right customers when we see they have a churn. So all that came together despite that we had a price adjustment that was large in the consumer group in the second quarter. The same goes for our business wireless. They performed well in the quarter. They had a little bit slow in the beginning of the year, but ramped really nicely also in the quarter. And again, they are market share leader on the wireless and they continue to be positive. So I'm pleased with that. On the ACP, I will let Tony comment on it. The only thing I want to say, I think -- we think it's important that everyone in these countries should be able to have wireless and broadband because it's such an essential service today. So that's why we historically already have plans on Fios that are for low income families, but also the whole prepaid family of products we have is also addressing that. Again, going back to -- being able to support that regardless if it's the recent ACP or not, but our segmentation model. And lastly, I think on the churn, our high quality customers, which is best in industry, that is really playing out in this environment with the products we have. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Sure. And John, good morning. So in terms of ACP, we stopped enrollments in February and still accepting transfers through May. As we said previously and -- in the prepared remarks, the majority of the exposure is in the prepaid business, and we have 1.1 million prepaid subs that are in the ACP program. We've said previously that the guidance assumed that the ACP funding stays intact. The impact or any impact would be seen on service revenue up to potential 50 basis points of headwind. And the margin exposure from ACP is actually very small. It was insignificant in the first quarter. And if nothing changes and the funding goes away in May, as is planned, then we have plans in place to address it, both from retention and potential acquisition opportunities as well. And obviously we'll continue to help everybody -- update everybody as we know more.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Okay thanks John. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open sir.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. I was curious if you could unpack a bit more of how you're thinking about the up-tiering opportunities within the post-paid phone base. And as you look at the Perks, is there a way that we should think about the revenue contribution from Perks and where that can go over time as an incremental way for Verizon to monetize the base?\nHans Vestberg : Hey, thanks Mike. Yeah, This is a long-term strategy of us. First of all, we have a great base of customers. We want to give them the flexibility on the consumer side. Then we add in the Perks. Of course, all that plays into value play for our customers, even though we up tier our customers. And that has gone very well. We said in the prepared remarks that almost a quarter of our customers have myPlan right now and we are expecting it to go to almost or go to half of the base, which is never had a product moving that fast because it resonates with the market. In there -- we have opportunities for both up-tiering and then adding services, all incremental for our bottom-line and accretive. And many of these offerings are savings for our customers which is just great. The Max-Netflix is for example a great saving, great product. We are the only one in the market that can do that on wireless. It's exclusive. And that's the type of things we do on Perks, very different rather. I wouldn't say shocked, but I would be at least surprised if Sampath and the consumer team doesn't continue to think how they can enlighten our customers even more with these type of things going forward. Tony.\nTony Skiadas: Sure. And Mike, just a couple other points. So we did see 4.4% ARPA growth in the first quarter. And as Hans talked about in myPlan, the premium mix is very strong. It's 42% of the lines in the base. And the Perk attach rates have steadily increased and then will continue to increase. So we feel really good about that and the discipline we see on promotions as well and keeping the amortization pressure in check.\nMichael Rollins: And one other if I could, operational efficiency. It sounds like a few times where they were talking about AI or just the broader focus on the operations, that this is an important priority for Verizon this year. Can you frame how much of the cost-cutting Verizon can deliver this year relative to the multi-year target that the company has established? And are there any milestones that we should be looking for that will signify some further progress on these initiatives?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. First of all, we're on track for our cost target that we have given to the market -- to The Street. Secondly, many of the larger sort of transactions and platform transactions we started already last year, the outsourcing to ATL, the customer care changes we did, which are large transactions, without any interruptions for our customers who have done those, they are coming into the base in 2024 and of course, full year \u201825. Then what I'm adding now is our opportunities in AI. Many of these things, of course, already thought about, but of course we see a great opportunity with AI to serve our customers better. We are already using, for example, personalization in myPlan with AI, and we are using it in our network when it comes to performance of the capacity deployment, as well as power consumption. So we are using AI and generative AI already now commercially. So this is not the playing ground for us. We just see more opportunities. On the flip side, of course we also see revenues. Our network was built for AI. That was my thought when I built Verizon Intelligent Edge Network five years ago or six years ago, that we're going to have compute and storage at the Edge. AI is sort of built for that with the low latency we have on the 5G network. And as we are deploying our 5G right now, with the mobile edge compute and AI, this is a great long-term opportunity for us using AI. So there are multiple places we see efficiencies, but also revenue opportunities with all the new technologies coming. Tony, anything else on the savings?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah, Mike, just to add a couple of things. So obviously, as Hans said, we're on track with the savings program, and those savings were contemplated in the guide. We're not going to discuss specific cost targets, but as Hans mentioned, we're operating a lot differently, and we feel really good about the cost actions that we're taking and the progress that we're making that are driving the EBITDA improvements that you saw in the first quarter and that we expect throughout 2024.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open, sir.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Hans, maybe one industry question for you. There's obviously a lot of assets up for sale, some smaller ones, some potentially bigger ones. There's also been talk about your potential interest in maybe partnering with ESPN in some form. Could you talk about how you see the industry structure evolving from here? Do you see this as some kind of equilibrium? Or is there any need for -- or an opportunity from your perspective in terms of balancing your asset base in a slightly different direction. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Kannan, thank you for the question. First of all, I think I said it in the beginning of the year, we're getting into a phase of the heavy investment, a lot of changes in our asset structure. We're coming into a phase where we have all the assets we need and we're executing on it. And you see the operation excellence coming out from it the last three quarters. I have a team that in many facets have actually changed quite a lot. We added two new team members this quarter. I feel really good where we stand with assets right now and how we're executing. And of course I can never say never to look into assets. That's my fiduciary responsibility. But I rather right now execute on what I have. And you see the performance when we have that with the C-band millimeter wave, the broadband growth we have, almost 400,000 again this quarter. So that's my main focus. When it comes to some of the other things, at the end you mentioned, I think we are using our base of distribution to actually work with all the streaming services. And we are uniquely positioned. We have the biggest distribution or direct-to-consumer in the market. We are taking leverage that for our customers and for our shareholders, but also seeing that we help some of these larger streaming services to see that they get better churn and of course better access to the best consumer base in the United States of America. So we will continue to do that and see that we're doing it in the right way. But again, I'm pleased with the asset base we have today.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Great.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Kannan. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one was just about the kind of the balance of revenue growth. I think that you guys talked about kind of a 60-40 balance of pricing and volumes is more normal. And over the last year it was more skewed to pricing. I was wondering if you could kind of talk about the relatively healthy 5% growth in gross adds versus what we're watching this quarter happened which is a decline in accounts. Could you talk a little bit about how you balance the relationship between accounts and gross new subscribers? And then the second question is just more of a housekeeping question which is you guys introduced the second number add-on this past quarter. There's been a lot of questions about where does that show up in the numbers. I'm guessing not in the sub-numbers. It\u2019s probably -- could you kind of elaborate about -- where we find that in the numbers? Thank you so much.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, David. First of all, our team is very focused to continue to get a little bit more of volume in the consumer side. Remember, on the business side, we're already in there. We are taking customers every quarter. We have done it for not sure how many quarters. So it's a little bit different dynamic on the service -- on the consumer side, we actually had a little bit more challenge in 2022. I think since second quarter 2023 with our myPlan and offerings, you see a constant improvement how we are actually addressing our customers. So I'm really pleased with that. But we have said, or Sampath has said on the consumer side, he want to have more on the volume side than only on the value side from customers. But that doesn't mean we will continue to get more value with our customers and what we're doing. On the second line, the only thing I want to say there, first of all, the innovation the team is doing right now is based on our strategy. We build a network once and we want as many profitable connections on the network in order to have the lowest return or the best return on invested capital in the industry. It's just playing straight into that narrative and this, of course, is accretive and we would take the second-line any given time. So again, you show the innovation and I'm prepared to see or I'm ready to see even more innovation from my team going forward. Tony.\nTony Skiadas: Yes, so Dave, on the second number, it is included in the line counts. I mean, the one thing we would say is it gives customers flexibility. They can add and remove it as desired. The adoption so far has been good, just a few points on that. It was very low single digit percentage of phone gross adds in the quarter for consumer. And we believe there's a limited market for this. As Hans said, it's ARPA and revenue accretive and it's high margin business. There's no incremental device. There's no incremental data usage and the results in the quarter reflect the strength of our core business. So we -- as Hans said, we would take this profitable connection any day of the week.\nHans Vestberg : And it goes back to the things -- the three things that I talked about that we are measured on from our shareholders, from our board and how I measure my management team. It's a service revenue growth, it's EBITDA and cash flow expansion. That's what we're measuring. Then it's 100 different measurements inside there. But those three are what we're incentivized on, and that's how we run our business.\nDavid Barden: Got it. And just to be totally clear, Tony, so of the five-point something gross add growth year-over-year in the quarter, maybe 1% or 2% of that was the second number add-ons, which might not continue because there's a finite market for that.\nTony Skiadas : We said it was a very low single digit percentage of phone gross adds, yes.\nDavid Barden: Perfect. Okay, thank you.\nBrady Connor: All right, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sebastiano Petti of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open, sir.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to see if you could give us an update on what you're seeing in the overall consumer broadband and particularly within consumer fixed wireless. Net adds did -- slow a little bit sequentially year-on-year. Obviously, the backdrops you called out the move environment remains a little bit challenged. Are you seeing incremental competition as AT&T Internet Air perhaps ramps up, even though maybe T-Mo is talking about a little bit of a slowdown there. That would be helpful. And then also touching upon, Hans, thinking about your thoughts on 5G use cases. I think you emphasized private networks a few times within the prepared remarks. How are you thinking about the development of the revenue opportunity here, maybe relative to how you're thinking about [MEC] (ph) as well, you kind of touched on that -- how AI plays into it. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you Sebastiano. Yeah, when we talk about the broadband, first of all I think Fios continue to be the stellar product, best fiber product in the market, both for businesses and for consumer. You see us continue -- it's a little bit up and down depending on mover markets and all of that, but we are very consistent on growth in that area, very pleased with that product. On the fixed wireless access, we continue to see very, very good net promoter score, the easiness of installing it, the greatness of the product, the quality of the product, all that plays in. So I just see that when we roll out our C-band we get new opportunities. On the consumer side, that we saw of course as an obvious use case. On the business side, we're seeing new use cases that we didn't see before. I mean, all the way from coffee shops replacing cable with fixed wireless access to large enterprises actually replacing with fixed wireless access as well for different use cases. So we had a super quarter in fixed wireless access in the business side this quarter. But again, we are dimensioning ourselves to be around 400 net adds quarter-by-quarter. That's how Joe, our Head of Network, is deploying the capital, the resources so we can handle it. So we're again pleased with that. We said it also was a little bit slower broadband market in the beginning of the year. The exit rates were better at the end of the quarter. So all-in-all good. On the 5G use cases, yeah, now we start talking more and more about private networks because the number of them are many -- then the value of them are still fairly small. But you know, when we build that base of private network, managed spectrum for enterprises, that's over time is going to be a great opportunity for our enterprise sales force to add in, do the mobile edge compute. And as I said, AI is like, that's how we built our mobile edge compute network. And we already have mobile edge compute in many of our sites across the country in order to be able to meet that compute and storage. So over time, long-term, and we are a long term company. We're going to be around for many, many years being telecoms. This is absolutely the right investment. Nobody else has built a network as we have done when it comes to AI network compute storage at the edge on the wireless network.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Sebastiano. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTimothy Horan: Thanks, guys. Tony, how sustainable do you think the 4% ARPA growth is? It seems like you have a lot of -- lot of levers to pull here, and it sounds like you're feeling a little bit more optimistic about that metric longer-term. And can you be just a little bit more specific in, you know, how much debt you kind of plan on paying down per year, maybe second half of this year or next year? Thank you.\nTony Skiadas : Sure. So on the ARPA growth, again you see the progress on gross adds and you saw the 5% growth on gross adds. You see the progress with myPlan and the continued premium mix has been very, very strong on myPlan, and that's continued. We see a further runway for growth, and you saw it in the first quarter. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we'll see a full quarter's effect of the pricing changes that we announced in the consumer business. And that launched in March. You'll see a full quarter's effect in the second quarter. So we feel very good about the progress on ARPA and that the team is making. And then on your second question, I'm sorry?\nTimothy Horan: How much debt do you think you can pay down per year? And just on ARPA, I guess the question is -- is this sustainable over a multi-year period? Thanks.\nTony Skiadas : Yeah, we're not going to give multiyear targets here, but we like the shape of the growth right now. We said we're on track with our service revenue growth through the year and the team is very focused on us. We said we were going to be phone net add positive in consumer and that's on track as well. And on the debt, so look, we're not going to give any targets on paying down debt. Our focus is on continuing to generate strong free cash flow to pay down debt in a meaningful way. In the second half of the year, we're on track to do that. We have 3.6 billion of unsecured maturities due this year. About half of that was addressed in the first quarter. And you should expect us to be opportunistic as the year goes on.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Tim. Brad, We're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Let's talk about something a little longer-term, which is spectrum and capacity. Your CapEx has been now trending down as you've largely gotten through the 5G build. I'm just wondering how we should think about your spectrum needs going forward and what your appetite would be for additional spectrum if some were to come available from DISH Network or, if you think about US Cellular, and how you think about that in the context of the spectrum screens at the FCC, which don't really leave much room for incumbent players to add. Do you think that those are a real impediment or do you think that those would likely be adjusted when the time comes?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you Craig. Great question. First of all, as we all know, right now the FCC doesn't have any spectrum to auction out them -- and they don't even have an approval to do it. So that's sort of constrained. Then it could, of course be secondhand market spectrum. We feel good about -- we have only deployed a piece of our C-band so far. So we have quite a lot left in -- our many of the sites have 60 megahertz or maybe at best 80. We have 161 megahertz nationwide. So we have quite a lot left of spectrum. And remember, That was the decision I, together with the board, took. We bought spectrum for decades, not for the next two quarters or something like that. So we feel really good about it. Then any opportunistic spectrum coming up, it's hard to predict. And even on whatever regulation is going to be around screens and that. I don't know. The only thing I know, I've sit here on a better position ever say, with my millimeter way, my C-band, my low-band, and how I build a network. And sometimes it's opportunistic spectrum is going to cost me a lot both for my customer interaction because some spectrum is not in the devices. I need new radios, new software. So you need to think when you re-engineer the network to see that you have the right spectrum all the way up to the customer. And I think that no one is even close to our team or radio planning doing that. But all-in-all, we feel good about where we are today. Let's see what's going to happen in the market of spectrum.\nCraig Moffett : Hans, You've [seesawed] (ph) back over time between a preference between network densification or more spectrum. Is there a sort of house view at the moment for where you think it's most attractive to add capacity? Would it now be through network densification rather than Spectrum or vice versa?\nHans Vestberg : A little bit early to say, and ultimately it's actually a call or return on investment that we do daily here. Should we put up a new tower? Should we densify? Should we put up new elements? Or should we add more spectrum? That's a regional, almost on ZIP code level that the team is going through this. So every time you see spectrum coming out in the secondhand market historically, you make a calculation. We feel good about the position we have again here with all the spectrum we have to make those choices internally rather than betting on external assets coming in. We don't need that. We have everything in-house right now for quite a while.\nCraig Moffett : Thank you.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Craig.\nBrady Connor: Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Williams of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nGreg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. You provided some great color on ACP. I think you said it could be a 50 basis point hit. I'm just curious if we can drill down there. Is that more of an ARPU hit with these new plans that are coming out, or is it more on the disconnect side? Second question is just on fiber-to-the-home and the open access models that we're seeing. We've seen some news flow with Tillman and Intrepid, et cetera, on open access and maybe even T-Mobile. And just trying to gauge your appetite to ride some of these open access CapEx light models if they come to fruition. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can take the first question -- the second question first. As we haven't done any open access deals yet, you can see that the appetite hasn't been that big. Anyhow, we're going to evaluate any type of opportunities that can fortify how we deliver to our customers. So far in this environment, with the very high capital cost, et cetera. It hasn't -- we haven't find a good return on investment on it. And again, we are very financially prudent. And remember, we have fixed wireless access, we have our Fios, we sort of -- we have [own this] (ph) economics on basically everything we're doing. That's why our return on investment is the highest in the industry and our EBITDA is the highest. We will continue to be disciplined. That doesn't mean I'm not going to look into other models, but right now there have not been any models that is appealing to me and the team and for our shareholders.\nTony Skiadas: And then Greg, on your question on ACPs, so as we said, it was up to a potential 50 basis points of headwind in service revenue. And that's a combination of ARPU and churn and it's lower ARPU. And we also said the margin exposure from ACP is also very, very small.\nGreg Williams: Got it. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Greg. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I had two if I could. First, could you provide an update on your efforts to pursue BEAD funding? Are you seeing any progress at the state level in establishing the rules? And based on what you are seeing there, are you more encouraged or discouraged by what you're seeing? And then separately, I was wondering if you could just provide any color on the company's performance in the first quarter within the larger metro markets relative to smaller mid-size markets and consumer. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. On the BEAD funding, yeah, I think that has been widely reported in the press. It is of course a complicated process to get the BEAD money out, et cetera. So we bid where we see it makes sense with return on investment and the subsidy is coming in there. There are some other broadband money coming into the market from the previous funds which were winning. We just had some quite large wins here recently in Pennsylvania. So we're using it but we do it when it makes sense from a profitable point of view. But again, it's probably going to take some time when we see this money rolling out. Second question is for you. I [think you remember] (ph) \u2026\nTony Skiadas: Yes, it was the question on the C-band market. So on the C-band markets -- in the early markets, the performance is much better. As we said earlier, the churn is much better, 4 basis points better in churn. The premium mix is also a lot better, and we see meaningful increase in gross add performance as well. So we're really, really pleased with the performance in C-band.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you very much.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Bryan. Brad, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nPeter Supino: Hi, good morning everybody. I wondered if you could talk about SG&A growth. It was up 11% in business and 4% in consumer. It was nicely offset by cost relief from lower upgrades. I'm just wondering if you're spending back some of that upside on SG&A and how we might think about modeling operating leverage and specifically SG&A going forward. And then if anybody would be willing to provide an update on your project of deploying millimeter wave spectrum in support of the FWA business to multi-dwelling units. Is that working the way you hope? And if so, could that provide upside to your long-term broadband growth targets? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. On the SG&A, we're very focused on seeing that we continue to get full leverage on the growth that we have right now. So the team is really focused on taking out costs. And I said, we are on track with that. We have a lot of initiatives ongoing. Tony will give you some more puts and takes on the SG&A in the quarter. On the millimeter wave MDU solution, that is progressing. We have said it will come in the second half, latter part of this year, in commercial. But we're piloting it right now and it's performing really well. So we feel really good about it. And it will over time, of course, add opportunity for us on MDUs that we haven't served with a fixed wireless access so far. So it will be an addition over time. Tony?\nTony Skiadas : Yeah, Peter, on your question on SG&A, some of that in the quarter is a function of the upfront work on transformation initiatives that will abate as the year progresses. And we also see pressure, year-over-year pressure on the handset insurance claims and we expect that to level off in the second quarter. We expect to see further operating leverage in the second half of the year.\nPeter Supino: Thank you very much.\nBrady Connor: Great, thanks Brad. That's all the time we have.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conferencing services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hans Vestberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we have started the year with a solid momentum, building on the progress we made throughout 2023. Our results this quarter further validate that our strategy is working and position us well for a profitable growth this year. Our execution in the first quarter keeps us on track towards our full year 2024 guidance, as we continue to deliver against our key financial metrics. We grew Wireless Service revenue and adjusted EBITDA and generated solid free cash flow. Operational Excellence is our priority. Our team is delivering. We have the right strategy, and we're working to keep this progress up quarter-by-quarter. It has been a busy quarter across our business. We produced big moments at the Super Bowl. Published our first consumer connections report, achieved milestones in our C-band rollout, added new members to our leadership team, published our annual ESG report, accomplished many goals with Citizen Verizon and completed a pension transaction that increases our financial flexibility. Verizon has a differentiated position in the industry. We have the highest quality customer base in consumer and business, the largest adjusted EBITDA, and a great team that knows how to execute our strategy. Turning to our first quarter results, Wireless Service revenue growth climbed to 3.3%. Our revenue performance combined with our work on cost efficiency programs translated to a $12.1 billion adjusted EBITDA, that's a year-over-year growth of 1.4%. We generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow and we expect free cash flow to build throughout the year, similar to 2023. Our core products on mobility, broadband and private networks are at the center of people's lives and businesses. Connectivity is only becoming more vital with each passing day, and our investments and world-class network ensure that our customers can depend on us to deliver the reliable, high-quality experience they deserve. Now, let me go into some specifics about this quarter. Our consumer team is executing extremely well. Despite taking further pricing action this quarter, our postpaid phone net adds performance improved year-over-year, evidence of how our differentiated value proposition is resonating with customers. Our net loss of 158,000 is more than 100,000 net adds better than our first quarter performance in 2023. This achievement was fueled by continued momentum in postpaid phone gross adds, which grew more than 5% year-over-year. We mitigated churn impacts from pricing actions through laser-focused retention efforts and the strength of our value proposition. These results represented Verizon Consumer Group's strongest first quarter postpaid phone net adds performance since 2018. Our targeted and segmented go-to-market approach, combined with myPlan and its exclusive perks, is clearly working. With myPlan, we are building a recurring revenue stream out of perks and services. These incentives, like our popular Netflix plus Max bundle, add value and deepen our customer relationships. We know our customers extremely well and tailor our offerings to their needs. We're bringing the same proven approach to our prepaid business. Within the quarter, we established our new value market leadership team, bringing in experts to execute our plans with speed and discipline. While there is still work to be done, we're seeing early signs of progress, in Visible and Total By Verizon. In February, we stopped processing new affordable connectivity program activations, which caused headwinds for our SafeLink brand. The ACP may shut down, but Verizon is committed to providing households with access to high-quality connectivity and reliable home internet without data caps, and does not believe that income should be a barrier to access. Since 2020 we have offered high speed home internet to qualifying customers for as low as $20 a month through our Verizon forward program and we have other plans to reach households who rely on ACP. For business mobility, postpaid phone net adds were 90,000. The team continues to put up subscriber growth as a market share leader in a competitive environment even while implementing pricing actions within the quarter. More businesses rely on Verizon than any other provider to deliver mission-critical support for their day-to-day operations. In total, first quarter post-paid phone net losses were 68,000, a 59,000 net loss improvement versus prior year. We're exiting the quarter with both consumer and business delivering their strongest performance in March, a good sign for the year ahead. Our broadband business continues to be a key growth engine, now serving more than 11 million subscribers. We have grown our base 18% over the last year and our network is a critical part of the infrastructure that homes and businesses rely on. Fixed wireless access has turned out to be a large and growing opportunity. This is now a meaningful piece of our business. We knew that fixed wireless access would be a hit with consumers who like its quality, reliability and easy setup. Businesses are showing similar excitement as this was our biggest quarter-to-date for the net adds in business fixed wireless access with 151,000 setting our new high. Fios remains extremely popular, with one of the highest third-party net promoters scored in the industry. And as we already know, Fios is the best pure broadband offering in the country. Together, Our total broadband portfolio delivered a strong quarter with 389,000 net adds. As with mobility, we saw good momentum with the broadband net adds as we exited the quarter and we expect that to continue. We also had a great quarter in private networks, signing transformative deals across industries. Xerox selected our Network and Service solution as its framework for modernizing its information technology system. We also signed a new private network deal with the global power solution leader, Cummins Inc. And iconic American sport leagues are turning to us for the networks that serve their fans, players, and coaches. We're on the field, on the aisles, and in the stands, and in the parking lots. During the quarter, we held a partner summit where we unveiled our sports and entertainment strategy. We are at the center of the culture moments that matter the most to our customers, from concerts and performance to athletic achievements and competition. We're already in every National Football League stadium in the country. We're now expanding services with NFL teams, including the installation of a private 5G network at the L.A. Chargers Training facility. We also renewed our partnership as the official 5G network of the National Hockey League in the United States and are expanding services throughout its arenas. As you may have seen in our consumer connection report during the \u201823-\u201824 NFL season, the average fan used more data than the year before. These live moments matter to our customers and they want to share them by text, by phone and by video. We are a vital part of their experiences. Our private networks business is growing and full of long-term contracts with the best partners around the world. All of this is supported by the infrastructure we have built and are building. We operate the nation's most reliable and robust network for all customers from households to global enterprises. Recently, we passed 250 million POPs covered with C-Band, achieving our target almost a year ahead of plan. The pace and quality of our build out is spectacular. And most importantly, our customers love the C-band experience. In the first 76 markets where we rolled out C-band, we see a higher premium mix and reduced churn. Our strategy from the start was to build a network once, to meet the needs of the present, and to optimize it for the future, and we're doing just that. We have been working with AI for several years, and our powerful network position Verizon to lead the AI revolution. In 2023, we released a set of responsible AI principles to guide our efforts to leverage new AI technologies in ways that positively impact our stakeholders and establish Verizon, as a trusted brand and partner with respect to AI. Enabling AI at scale for improved customer service is a key. We're also aggressively driving AI transformative potential with our businesses, something our network was built to support. We already had several generative AI projects going live. Our AI strategy focuses on three priorities. First, optimizing internal processes and operations through machine learning, such as creating efficiencies in fuel consumption. AI is already centered to our cost transformation program and will become even more important over time. Secondly, enhancing product experiences with AI capabilities like the personalized plan recommendation on myPlan, which is producing good early results. And thirdly, establishing an AI-based revenue stream by commercializing our network's unique low latency, high bandwidth, and robust mobile edge compute capabilities. Generative AI workloads represent a great long-term opportunity for us. As we expand our network and increase our performance advantage, we're also making Verizon a more efficient organization. We are back to business as usual level on CapEx spend, as we had promised. And we have struck a balance between profitable growth and free cash flow that supports both our dividend and a stronger balance sheet. This gives us greater flexibility to accelerate deleveraging throughout the second half of the year, bringing us closer to our long-term leverage targets. Our dividend is healthy and secure, and our free cash flow dividend payout ratio continues to improve. We are focused on putting our board in a position to continue to raise the dividend each year, building on our current industry record of 17 consecutive increases. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial and operational performance in more detail. Tony. Thank you, Tony. I'm proud of our team and pleased with our financial and operational performance in the first quarter. We exited the quarter with good momentum across the business positioning us well for the year ahead. We're [scaling] (ph) fixed wireless access and private networks while growing our core mobility business. Our disciplined, targeted and segmented consumer strategy continues to prove itself. And we will apply the same level of energy and execution to the prepaid market. Network excellence drives our business forward and we will not let up on that. Our consistent network investment puts us in an unmatched position to deliver AI services at scale. Finally, our cash flow generation is solid. This shows that we are executing well against our financial objectives. Our cash flow strength allows us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, including supporting our dividend and paying down our debt. With strong momentum already in the start of the second quarter, I'm confident in our ability to sustain progress towards unlocking Verizon's full potential for all stakeholders. Now, Brady, we are ready to take questions. Thank you, Simon. Let me start with the consumer business. As we saw in the quarter, it was a little bit slow in the beginning of the quarter both for consumer and for business when it comes to wireless. But then I think we clearly see that our products are resonating with the customers. And on the consumer side, myPlan is really doing well. And as Tony said in the prepared remarks, the Perks is now coming up. Our premium is also increasing. So clearly, we see that. At the same time, the team has spent a lot of time to be disciplined both with promotions and churn management. And you saw we had the price up in the quarter on consumer that was pretty wide. But our team actually kept the churn down on the consumer side. I mean, it shows first of all how great our product is, but also see how well we're using the AI tools and all of that to see that our customers are getting the value and we are actually directing the money to the right customers. That's what you see coming out in the financial discipline in everything we're doing. Yeah, the promotions were lower again this quarter. But again, it's a way for us to segment the market to see that we have the right products. And that's what I've seen for quite a while right now on the consumer side. And what I said also is that -- we have said several times right now, we expect consumer to be positive net add this year. So they are doing it. And [Sampath] (ph) team probably have even more innovations coming. And when myPlan was one, the Perks and other, they have more things to come during the year. So I'm really excited about what we're doing on the wireless side. And of course competition is the same. There's nothing new, but it's the same as we've seen for quite a while. But we just performed way better. We have the right product, we have the right people, we have made the right changes in operation model and that's what we're seeing right now. And now we move all that into prepaid and you saw that we're also doing prepaid better but still we have more to be done. The team has their heads down, very focused on execution. Very pleased with what they've seen so far. That doesn't mean we're not going to push even harder going forward. Tony? Thank you, John. On the first question there on consumer net adds in the short-term, I stay on my previous comment. Consumer net adds should be positive in 2024. The team is of course doing quite good right now. Actually 100,000 better in the first quarter here on net adds. Let them continue to execute. They have a great product that resonates with the market. And they will continue to execute well on that. On the churn side, I think first of all, I mean, if you look at the market, of course we see both inflation and -- a higher interest rate. But think about the product, first of all, so good right now. Everybody needs wireless and broadband. And I think that -- that has improved quite dramatically over the last couple of years. Secondly, our products right now are so well segmented for different segments, for different groups. And thirdly, we're laser focused \u2013 on churn management. The team with Sampath, the AI tools we have, so we actually spend on the right customers when we see they have a churn. So all that came together despite that we had a price adjustment that was large in the consumer group in the second quarter. The same goes for our business wireless. They performed well in the quarter. They had a little bit slow in the beginning of the year, but ramped really nicely also in the quarter. And again, they are market share leader on the wireless and they continue to be positive. So I'm pleased with that. On the ACP, I will let Tony comment on it. The only thing I want to say, I think -- we think it's important that everyone in these countries should be able to have wireless and broadband because it's such an essential service today. So that's why we historically already have plans on Fios that are for low income families, but also the whole prepaid family of products we have is also addressing that. Again, going back to -- being able to support that regardless if it's the recent ACP or not, but our segmentation model. And lastly, I think on the churn, our high quality customers, which is best in industry, that is really playing out in this environment with the products we have. Tony? Hey, thanks Mike. Yeah, This is a long-term strategy of us. First of all, we have a great base of customers. We want to give them the flexibility on the consumer side. Then we add in the Perks. Of course, all that plays into value play for our customers, even though we up tier our customers. And that has gone very well. We said in the prepared remarks that almost a quarter of our customers have myPlan right now and we are expecting it to go to almost or go to half of the base, which is never had a product moving that fast because it resonates with the market. In there -- we have opportunities for both up-tiering and then adding services, all incremental for our bottom-line and accretive. And many of these offerings are savings for our customers which is just great. The Max-Netflix is for example a great saving, great product. We are the only one in the market that can do that on wireless. It's exclusive. And that's the type of things we do on Perks, very different rather. I wouldn't say shocked, but I would be at least surprised if Sampath and the consumer team doesn't continue to think how they can enlighten our customers even more with these type of things going forward. Tony. Thank you. First of all, we're on track for our cost target that we have given to the market -- to The Street. Secondly, many of the larger sort of transactions and platform transactions we started already last year, the outsourcing to ATL, the customer care changes we did, which are large transactions, without any interruptions for our customers who have done those, they are coming into the base in 2024 and of course, full year \u201825. Then what I'm adding now is our opportunities in AI. Many of these things, of course, already thought about, but of course we see a great opportunity with AI to serve our customers better. We are already using, for example, personalization in myPlan with AI, and we are using it in our network when it comes to performance of the capacity deployment, as well as power consumption. So we are using AI and generative AI already now commercially. So this is not the playing ground for us. We just see more opportunities. On the flip side, of course we also see revenues. Our network was built for AI. That was my thought when I built Verizon Intelligent Edge Network five years ago or six years ago, that we're going to have compute and storage at the Edge. AI is sort of built for that with the low latency we have on the 5G network. And as we are deploying our 5G right now, with the mobile edge compute and AI, this is a great long-term opportunity for us using AI. So there are multiple places we see efficiencies, but also revenue opportunities with all the new technologies coming. Tony, anything else on the savings? Kannan, thank you for the question. First of all, I think I said it in the beginning of the year, we're getting into a phase of the heavy investment, a lot of changes in our asset structure. We're coming into a phase where we have all the assets we need and we're executing on it. And you see the operation excellence coming out from it the last three quarters. I have a team that in many facets have actually changed quite a lot. We added two new team members this quarter. I feel really good where we stand with assets right now and how we're executing. And of course I can never say never to look into assets. That's my fiduciary responsibility. But I rather right now execute on what I have. And you see the performance when we have that with the C-band millimeter wave, the broadband growth we have, almost 400,000 again this quarter. So that's my main focus. When it comes to some of the other things, at the end you mentioned, I think we are using our base of distribution to actually work with all the streaming services. And we are uniquely positioned. We have the biggest distribution or direct-to-consumer in the market. We are taking leverage that for our customers and for our shareholders, but also seeing that we help some of these larger streaming services to see that they get better churn and of course better access to the best consumer base in the United States of America. So we will continue to do that and see that we're doing it in the right way. But again, I'm pleased with the asset base we have today. Thank you, David. First of all, our team is very focused to continue to get a little bit more of volume in the consumer side. Remember, on the business side, we're already in there. We are taking customers every quarter. We have done it for not sure how many quarters. So it's a little bit different dynamic on the service -- on the consumer side, we actually had a little bit more challenge in 2022. I think since second quarter 2023 with our myPlan and offerings, you see a constant improvement how we are actually addressing our customers. So I'm really pleased with that. But we have said, or Sampath has said on the consumer side, he want to have more on the volume side than only on the value side from customers. But that doesn't mean we will continue to get more value with our customers and what we're doing. On the second line, the only thing I want to say there, first of all, the innovation the team is doing right now is based on our strategy. We build a network once and we want as many profitable connections on the network in order to have the lowest return or the best return on invested capital in the industry. It's just playing straight into that narrative and this, of course, is accretive and we would take the second-line any given time. So again, you show the innovation and I'm prepared to see or I'm ready to see even more innovation from my team going forward. Tony. And it goes back to the things -- the three things that I talked about that we are measured on from our shareholders, from our board and how I measure my management team. It's a service revenue growth, it's EBITDA and cash flow expansion. That's what we're measuring. Then it's 100 different measurements inside there. But those three are what we're incentivized on, and that's how we run our business. Thank you Sebastiano. Yeah, when we talk about the broadband, first of all I think Fios continue to be the stellar product, best fiber product in the market, both for businesses and for consumer. You see us continue -- it's a little bit up and down depending on mover markets and all of that, but we are very consistent on growth in that area, very pleased with that product. On the fixed wireless access, we continue to see very, very good net promoter score, the easiness of installing it, the greatness of the product, the quality of the product, all that plays in. So I just see that when we roll out our C-band we get new opportunities. On the consumer side, that we saw of course as an obvious use case. On the business side, we're seeing new use cases that we didn't see before. I mean, all the way from coffee shops replacing cable with fixed wireless access to large enterprises actually replacing with fixed wireless access as well for different use cases. So we had a super quarter in fixed wireless access in the business side this quarter. But again, we are dimensioning ourselves to be around 400 net adds quarter-by-quarter. That's how Joe, our Head of Network, is deploying the capital, the resources so we can handle it. So we're again pleased with that. We said it also was a little bit slower broadband market in the beginning of the year. The exit rates were better at the end of the quarter. So all-in-all good. On the 5G use cases, yeah, now we start talking more and more about private networks because the number of them are many -- then the value of them are still fairly small. But you know, when we build that base of private network, managed spectrum for enterprises, that's over time is going to be a great opportunity for our enterprise sales force to add in, do the mobile edge compute. And as I said, AI is like, that's how we built our mobile edge compute network. And we already have mobile edge compute in many of our sites across the country in order to be able to meet that compute and storage. So over time, long-term, and we are a long term company. We're going to be around for many, many years being telecoms. This is absolutely the right investment. Nobody else has built a network as we have done when it comes to AI network compute storage at the edge on the wireless network. Thank you Craig. Great question. First of all, as we all know, right now the FCC doesn't have any spectrum to auction out them -- and they don't even have an approval to do it. So that's sort of constrained. Then it could, of course be secondhand market spectrum. We feel good about -- we have only deployed a piece of our C-band so far. So we have quite a lot left in -- our many of the sites have 60 megahertz or maybe at best 80. We have 161 megahertz nationwide. So we have quite a lot left of spectrum. And remember, That was the decision I, together with the board, took. We bought spectrum for decades, not for the next two quarters or something like that. So we feel really good about it. Then any opportunistic spectrum coming up, it's hard to predict. And even on whatever regulation is going to be around screens and that. I don't know. The only thing I know, I've sit here on a better position ever say, with my millimeter way, my C-band, my low-band, and how I build a network. And sometimes it's opportunistic spectrum is going to cost me a lot both for my customer interaction because some spectrum is not in the devices. I need new radios, new software. So you need to think when you re-engineer the network to see that you have the right spectrum all the way up to the customer. And I think that no one is even close to our team or radio planning doing that. But all-in-all, we feel good about where we are today. Let's see what's going to happen in the market of spectrum. A little bit early to say, and ultimately it's actually a call or return on investment that we do daily here. Should we put up a new tower? Should we densify? Should we put up new elements? Or should we add more spectrum? That's a regional, almost on ZIP code level that the team is going through this. So every time you see spectrum coming out in the secondhand market historically, you make a calculation. We feel good about the position we have again here with all the spectrum we have to make those choices internally rather than betting on external assets coming in. We don't need that. We have everything in-house right now for quite a while. Thank you, Craig. I can take the first question -- the second question first. As we haven't done any open access deals yet, you can see that the appetite hasn't been that big. Anyhow, we're going to evaluate any type of opportunities that can fortify how we deliver to our customers. So far in this environment, with the very high capital cost, et cetera. It hasn't -- we haven't find a good return on investment on it. And again, we are very financially prudent. And remember, we have fixed wireless access, we have our Fios, we sort of -- we have [own this] (ph) economics on basically everything we're doing. That's why our return on investment is the highest in the industry and our EBITDA is the highest. We will continue to be disciplined. That doesn't mean I'm not going to look into other models, but right now there have not been any models that is appealing to me and the team and for our shareholders. Thank you. On the BEAD funding, yeah, I think that has been widely reported in the press. It is of course a complicated process to get the BEAD money out, et cetera. So we bid where we see it makes sense with return on investment and the subsidy is coming in there. There are some other broadband money coming into the market from the previous funds which were winning. We just had some quite large wins here recently in Pennsylvania. So we're using it but we do it when it makes sense from a profitable point of view. But again, it's probably going to take some time when we see this money rolling out. Second question is for you. I [think you remember] (ph) ... Thank you. On the SG&A, we're very focused on seeing that we continue to get full leverage on the growth that we have right now. So the team is really focused on taking out costs. And I said, we are on track with that. We have a lot of initiatives ongoing. Tony will give you some more puts and takes on the SG&A in the quarter. On the millimeter wave MDU solution, that is progressing. We have said it will come in the second half, latter part of this year, in commercial. But we're piloting it right now and it's performing really well. So we feel really good about it. And it will over time, of course, add opportunity for us on MDUs that we haven't served with a fixed wireless access so far. So it will be an addition over time. Tony?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tony Skiadas",
            "content": "Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong execution of our team, building on the momentum from 2023 and delivering solid results in our three priorities of Wireless Service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. We saw further improvements in postpaid phone net adds and another strong quarter of growth in our broadband subscriber base. We accomplished this while maintaining our promotional discipline as evidenced by our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.4% and more than 16% year-over-year free cash flow growth. Consumer post-paid phone net losses were 158,000 for the quarter, better versus the prior year by 105,000, driven by improvements in both gross adds and churn. As Hans mentioned, this represents our best first quarter performance in consumer post-paid phone net adds since 2018. We continue to see improved operational performance with consumer post-paid phone gross adds up more than 5% year-over-year. And as you heard from Hans, we exited the quarter with good momentum. The changes we made over the last few quarters, including launching a regional sales structure and updating our sales compensation plans, provide the right framework for our go-to-market approach. We believe these changes, combined with the continued success of myPlan and increased utilization of C-band, will help us sustain our momentum. Consumer postpaid phone churn of 0.83% represents a 1 basis point improvement year-over-year. This result is a reflection of the strength of our value proposition, as well as our high quality customer base. The first quarter post-paid phone net add improvement coincided with a further decline in upgrades, which were down nearly 21% year-over-year. We continue to see success with our disciplined and segmented approach to customer offers in alignment with our strategy. On the business side, we delivered 90,000 postpaid phone net adds. Business volume results were challenged early in the quarter as the team implemented pricing increases in January. However, we saw positive net add momentum built throughout the quarter and we exited the quarter well positioned to continue to build on operational improvements in both mobility and broadband. That sales performance helped Verizon business achieve fixed wireless access net adds of 151,000, their best quarterly result to-date. We've been pleased with how businesses have adopted FWA and we continue to see strong demand from small businesses and enterprises which are attracted to the ease of deployment, reliability, and the flexibility of the product. Fixed wireless net adds for consumer were 203,000 resulting in a consolidated total of 354,000. This reflects the attractiveness of FWA as an alternative to traditional cable broadband, even in the market that saw muted activity. We continue to be comfortable with this pace of growth, believing it provides the right combination of base growth, ARPU accretion, and the superior experience our customers expect on the Verizon network. And our third-party Net Promoter Scores for our FWA product continue to outpace traditional cable broadband offerings, as we remain focused on building a long-term sustainable business. Overall, broadband net adds were 389,000, including 53,000 Fios Internet net adds. We're pleased with how Fios continues to grow in the marketplace, even as move activity across the country remains lower than prior years. We finished the quarter with over 11.1 million broadband subscribers, including over 3.4 million on FWA. We've now added more than 3 million broadband subscribers in the last two years alone. On prepaid, starting this quarter, we are disclosing subscriber results with and without our SafeLink brand. This disclosure provides improved transparency into our prepaid results. As a reminder, SafeLink is our government subsidy program brand offering and holds the majority of our ACP customers. The actions we've taken to scale Visible and Total by Verizon, as well as address operational execution with Straight Talk, drove improvements in our prepaid performance. Prepaid net losses excluding SafeLink were better by 146,000 year-over-year. While we are pleased to see the improvements, we still have work to do to address challenges in the prepaid business. That includes navigating the uncertainty around ACP, and we recently announced plans to provide accessible, affordable, and reliable connectivity options for those who need it most. As a reminder, we have approximately 1.1 million prepaid ACP subscribers as of the end of the first quarter. We expect the elimination of the program to result in lower wireless service revenue but have minimal impact on our adjusted EBITDA. Moving to our financials, consolidated revenue for the quarter was $33 billion, up 0.2% year-over-year. The benefits of the pricing actions we took in the quarter, combined with improved operating metrics, offset the year-over-year decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to lower upgrades. Wireless service revenue growth was 3.3% for the first quarter. This represents a significant acceleration in our revenue growth as the full year 2023 growth rate, excluding the reallocation of certain revenues, was only 1.3%. Consumer led the way with wireless service revenue growth of 3.4%, driven by ARPA growth of 4.4%, and improved year-over-year postpaid phone net add performance. In addition to targeted pricing actions, ARPA continues to benefit from the further adoption of myPlan. myPlan has been instrumental in growing our premium mix, which now stands at 42% of our postpaid phone base. We're also starting to see a growing impact from perk revenue as we scale the number of subscriptions. With over 20% of the postpaid base on myPlan, we see further opportunities for ARPA accretion as we expect to double the number of customers on myPlan in our postpaid base by the end of this year. For the first time, we are disclosing fixed wireless access revenue within our externally released results. FWA revenue, which is included in wireless service revenue, was $452 million for the quarter, up nearly $200 million versus the prior year. Headwinds in prepaid revenue continue to partially offset the gains from ARPA performance in wireless service revenue. For the quarter, prepaid revenue declined $106 million versus the prior year. While this is an improvement over the prior quarter, it represented an approximately 60 basis point drag on total wireless service revenue growth. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was approximately $12.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 1.4% compared to the prior year driven by the growth in wireless service revenue, as well as the impact of lower upgrade volumes. With a full quarter's impact from our recent pricing actions, we anticipate the second quarter's adjusted EBITDA growth to accelerate year-over-year. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items were down 0.5% year-over-year. Lower cost of equipment and cost of services were partially offset by an increase in SG&A. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.15, down 4.2% compared to the prior year, as gains in adjusted EBITDA were more than offset by higher interest expense, predominantly due to the lower capitalized interest, now that a large portion of the C-band spectrum licenses have been placed into service. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up over 16% or nearly $400 million from the first quarter of 2023. On a full year basis, nothing has changed. With free cash flow, we still expect the same puts and takes we shared with you in January. As Hans said, we expect free cash flow to build throughout the year, similar to 2023. Cash flow from operating activities came in at $7.1 billion. Within the quarter, we saw year-over-year pressures from higher interest expense, primarily related to the reduction in capitalized interest. We also made a discretionary pension contribution of $365 million prior to the closing of the retiree pension annuity transaction that we previously disclosed. CapEx for the quarter was $4.4 billion compared to $6 billion in the prior year as a result of our return to BAU levels of spend and historical levels of capital intensity. Our full year guidance of $17 billion to $17.5 billion in CapEx spending remains unchanged. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126 billion, a $3.7 billion improvement year-over-year, and a nearly $400 million improvement sequentially. During the quarter, we issued our sixth green bond for $1 billion with proceeds committed to fund additional renewable energy purchases. Net unsecured debt was also impacted by payments of approximately $270 million related to clearance of our C-band spectrum licenses, which are now substantially complete. While these payments do not affect our free cash flow, they are a use of cash. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times in-line with the previous quarter. Given the strength and momentum of our business, we continue to see a clear path to meaningfully delever the balance sheet in the second half of this year. In closing, I'm happy with our start to 2024, and our results from the first quarter set us up well to deliver on our financial guidance for the year. Our disciplined approach continues to put us in a strong position to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Our focus remains on driving operational improvements throughout the year. With that, I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before opening the call up for your questions. Yeah, sure. So good morning, Simon. So a couple of points on churn. So the results on C-band are significantly better. We see, you know, strong churn performance, higher premium mix, and also higher gross adds in C-band markets. And, you know, overall in 2024, it's reasonable to expect similar or lower churn in the consumer business compared to 2023. And then on your cash flow question, in the prepared remarks, we said that free cash flow would have a similar shape to last year and build throughout the year. We do expect free cash flow to be up meaningfully in the second quarter. We still see the same puts and takes on free cash flow for the full year as we described in January. So nothing's really changed there. On your question on the quarter, let me start with operating cash flow and let me unpack that for you. So we saw the discretionary pension contribution in the quarter. That was $365 million in connection with the pension annuitization transaction that we announced in early March. As we said previously, the lower capitalized interest from C-band now manifests itself in operating cash flow, and that was about $300 million higher year-over-year. And the third point I'd make is, you know, we're funding the business for growth and very, very confident in our ability to execute and you saw that again. You saw the growth in the fourth quarter with strong gross adds and we followed that up with 5% gross add growth in the consumer business in the first quarter. And with that growth comes working capital timing that will settle in the second quarter. But overall we're very confident in the cash generation of the business and nonetheless we expect to generate strong free cash flow and we see no obstacles in paying down debt in a meaningful way in the second half of 2024. Sure. And John, good morning. So in terms of ACP, we stopped enrollments in February and still accepting transfers through May. As we said previously and -- in the prepared remarks, the majority of the exposure is in the prepaid business, and we have 1.1 million prepaid subs that are in the ACP program. We've said previously that the guidance assumed that the ACP funding stays intact. The impact or any impact would be seen on service revenue up to potential 50 basis points of headwind. And the margin exposure from ACP is actually very small. It was insignificant in the first quarter. And if nothing changes and the funding goes away in May, as is planned, then we have plans in place to address it, both from retention and potential acquisition opportunities as well. And obviously we'll continue to help everybody -- update everybody as we know more. Sure. And Mike, just a couple other points. So we did see 4.4% ARPA growth in the first quarter. And as Hans talked about in myPlan, the premium mix is very strong. It's 42% of the lines in the base. And the Perk attach rates have steadily increased and then will continue to increase. So we feel really good about that and the discipline we see on promotions as well and keeping the amortization pressure in check. Yeah, Mike, just to add a couple of things. So obviously, as Hans said, we're on track with the savings program, and those savings were contemplated in the guide. We're not going to discuss specific cost targets, but as Hans mentioned, we're operating a lot differently, and we feel really good about the cost actions that we're taking and the progress that we're making that are driving the EBITDA improvements that you saw in the first quarter and that we expect throughout 2024. Yes, so Dave, on the second number, it is included in the line counts. I mean, the one thing we would say is it gives customers flexibility. They can add and remove it as desired. The adoption so far has been good, just a few points on that. It was very low single digit percentage of phone gross adds in the quarter for consumer. And we believe there's a limited market for this. As Hans said, it's ARPA and revenue accretive and it's high margin business. There's no incremental device. There's no incremental data usage and the results in the quarter reflect the strength of our core business. So we -- as Hans said, we would take this profitable connection any day of the week. We said it was a very low single digit percentage of phone gross adds, yes. Sure. So on the ARPA growth, again you see the progress on gross adds and you saw the 5% growth on gross adds. You see the progress with myPlan and the continued premium mix has been very, very strong on myPlan, and that's continued. We see a further runway for growth, and you saw it in the first quarter. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we'll see a full quarter's effect of the pricing changes that we announced in the consumer business. And that launched in March. You'll see a full quarter's effect in the second quarter. So we feel very good about the progress on ARPA and that the team is making. And then on your second question, I'm sorry? Yeah, we're not going to give multiyear targets here, but we like the shape of the growth right now. We said we're on track with our service revenue growth through the year and the team is very focused on us. We said we were going to be phone net add positive in consumer and that's on track as well. And on the debt, so look, we're not going to give any targets on paying down debt. Our focus is on continuing to generate strong free cash flow to pay down debt in a meaningful way. In the second half of the year, we're on track to do that. We have 3.6 billion of unsecured maturities due this year. About half of that was addressed in the first quarter. And you should expect us to be opportunistic as the year goes on. And then Greg, on your question on ACPs, so as we said, it was up to a potential 50 basis points of headwind in service revenue. And that's a combination of ARPU and churn and it's lower ARPU. And we also said the margin exposure from ACP is also very, very small. Yes, it was the question on the C-band market. So on the C-band markets -- in the early markets, the performance is much better. As we said earlier, the churn is much better, 4 basis points better in churn. The premium mix is also a lot better, and we see meaningful increase in gross add performance as well. So we're really, really pleased with the performance in C-band. Yeah, Peter, on your question on SG&A, some of that in the quarter is a function of the upfront work on transformation initiatives that will abate as the year progresses. And we also see pressure, year-over-year pressure on the handset insurance claims and we expect that to level off in the second quarter. We expect to see further operating leverage in the second half of the year."
