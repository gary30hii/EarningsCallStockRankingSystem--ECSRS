At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Allstate's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted today's presentation on our Web site at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements so please refer to the 10-K for 2019 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Amidst the pandemic Allstate delivered really attractive returns while building higher growth business models in 2020, exceptional progress has made building higher growth business models to execute our strategy of increasing market share in personal property liability, and expanding protections offered to its customers. And as you know, one of our key focuses this year was transitioning the personal property liability business to higher growth. We took decisive actions and despite the operational complexity of these actions maintained Allstate brand property liability policies in force. We'll take you through a reconciliation of the various components of this and you'll see the path to growth. We've made excellent progress in expanding protection offered to customers with total policies in force increasing by 20.5% to nearly 176 million. We took advantage of the decline in auto accident frequency and our cost reductions to improve our competitive price position in auto insurance while maintaining attractive returns. The acquisition of National General is expected to increase auto insurers market share by 1 percentage point in 2021 and provides another platform for growth as we expand its product breadth. These changes position Allstate have sustainable long term growth. At the same time, Allstate generated strong profitability and returns in 2020. Net income was $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share. This was driven by lower frequency of auto accident, continued strong profitability of homeowners insurance and higher performance based investment income. Net income was $5.5 billion and adjusted net income was $4.6 billion for the year. This represents a 19.8% return on equity far in excess of most insurance companies. Our strategy is to increase market share in personal property liability while expanding protection services to customers will increase shareholder value. Higher property liability growth with attractive returns, rapidly growing protection services expand our total addressable market. And this growth, combined with our proactive capital deployment strategy, supports returns on equity above the insurance industry and are comparable to the S&P 500. Slide 3 is there to touch base on the strategy and so we're not going to spend time on that. So let's move to Slide 4 and discuss this strategy as it relates to the property liability business. A transformative growth has become more than a [plan], it's about creating a business model, capabilities and culture that continually transform to deliver market share growth. This is done by focusing on the customer, expanding access and improving value. Expanding access includes all the ways customers choose to interact, exclusive agents directly through call centers to the web and independent agents. The largest part of this change was transitioning our exclusive agent and direct businesses that operate under the Allstate brand. This gave us the ability to lower costs, leverage scale and increase advertising. This transaction is successfully being implemented, and we achieved key milestones in 2020. We were pleased with new business growth from existing Allstate agents who remain key to serving our customers and growing. Property liability business from existing agents met our goals, except for the pandemic slowdown in March and April where, of course, nobody was buying anything, as we shifted commission to new sales from retention. We're testing new agent models with less real estate and more efficient service enabled by technology with the goal of having strong local personal relationships with customers. These models will also create learnings to enable existing agents to achieve higher growth. As a result of that, we did stop appointing new Allstate agents in early 2020 while a higher growth in lower cost models being developed. This had a negative impact on points of presence and new business sales. At the same time, we increased direct sales. The net was that overall policies in force remained the same through the transition despite a drop in retention, which was concurrent with the ending of the special payment plans related to the pandemic. Glenn will take you through that reconciliation in a couple of minutes. The acquisition of National General in January also improves growth prospects. And as you know, this is essentially a reverse merger. The National General team is joining Allstate and they're consolidating our independent agent businesses, encompassing AIA into their operational and technology platform. Then we're going to be able to broaden National General's product portfolio using Allstate standard auto and homeowners insurance capabilities, which will create growth through independent agents. We also made great progress at improving customer value last year. From a customer value standpoint, we've maintained attractive margins through cost reductions while investing in growth. This includes improving the competitive price position of auto insurance through targeted rate reductions and a direct pricing discount. And while most of these changes are due to the lower frequency of auto actions, we are also reducing cost to ensure we continue to generate attractive margins. We're also expanding our industry leading telematics offerings, Drivewise and Milewise, to further improve our value proposition and improving its pricing expectations. We're the only company that major companies selling Milewise, which is very attractive to customers today because they're not driving as much. Our goal is not just to execute this plan but to continually generate transformational growth. We have the brand, market position, resources, capabilities and strategy to deliver this for shareholders. An extensive Allstate agent platform delivers more value per dollar to customers and competitors; a direct business utilizing the Allstate brand, competitive prices, broad product offerings and our insurance expertise; an independent agent business with national distribution and strong position in both auto and homeowners insurance; and protection services with innovative business models and expanding total addressable markets. We're well on our way to achieving this goal after putting the foundational elements into place last year. Let's move to Slide 4 to discuss Allstate's excellent financial performance in 2020. Revenues of $12 billion in the fourth quarter increased 4.8% to the prior year quarter, with total revenues for the year reaching $44.8 billion, which is primarily driven by higher premiums earned, which is partially offset then by lower net investment income. Net income was $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter and $5.5 billion for the full year 2020. Adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income increased to $4.6 billion or $14.73 per diluted share. We had strong profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance. Adjusted net income return on equity is 19.8% over the last 12 months, exceeding our range of 14% to 17%, which is near the top of the insurance industry. Now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the transition of the property liability businesses to higher growth.\nGlenn Shapiro: Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Slide 6. We'll discuss how Allstate is increasing property liability market share while maintaining attractive returns. With the foundational work completed in 2020, Allstate is positioned to grow market share in '21 while developing a leading position in all three primary distribution channels in property liability. Some of the actions taken in '20 have impacted growth in the near term but they were critical to advancing transformative growth in the longer term. Starting with Allstate exclusive agents who serve customers that value local advice and relationships, we're focused on accelerating growth and improving efficiency. Allstate agents continue to be a core strength of our organization. We're further strengthening that model by focusing on new business growth and lowering costs by improving marketing effectiveness, centralizing customer services and enhancing customer connectivity. Leveraging Esurance's direct capabilities under the Allstate brand, we've created an omnichannel experience that meets the customer where, how and when they want to interact with us. We completed the integration of direct processes and systems in 2020 and expect direct sold business to continue to accelerate. As Tom mentioned, National General is another exciting growth platform for us. I mean National General's independent agent facing technology, it's among the best in the industry and then our combined agency footprint covers the vast majority of the US market. So as we expand products on the National General platform, we're going to be in a position to grow share in the IA channel. The totality of this go to market model with strong capabilities in each distribution channel is designed to generate higher growth. Allstate's leading pricing and claims capabilities, including our strength in telematics, puts us in a strong competitive position. We're also enhancing our price competitiveness while maintaining attractive returns. The impact of the pandemic on miles driven and lower costs for auto losses gave us an opportunity to improve auto affordability through targeted rate reductions. We've also lowered underwriting expenses, as Tom mentioned. They're down 1.9 points over the last two years when excluding restructuring and coronavirus related expenses. These efficiencies and continued cost structure reductions allow us to improve pricing relative to competitors while generating excellent returns. Allstate has a strong record of profitability across lines of business and in different market conditions. The average combined ratio in auto insurance over the last five years was 94.4, and that excludes, obviously, 2020 results, which were influenced by the pandemic. We're equally strong at homeowners, where we averaged a combined ratio of 89.5 over the last five years. And that reflects the higher cost of capital or the higher capital requirements, I should say, in homeowners product versus auto. The point is we expect to grow and we expect to earn really attractive returns. So let's go to Slide 7, and we're going to discuss National General, the acquisition in a little more detail. On January 4th, Allstate closed the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead with National General and how this advances our strategy to grow personal lines. And it gives us an estimated increase of over 1 percentage point of total personal property liability market share. Allstate is now a top five personal lines carrier in the IA channel with significantly better competitive position. We utilize National General as our independent agent platform by consolidating our encompass and Allstate independent agency operations into the new entity, which will be branded National General and Allstate company. We expect to grow by rolling out new standard auto and homeowners insurance offerings starting later this year and completing countrywide deployment in less than two years. Consistent with past acquisitions, we've developed measures of success and we're showing those in the bottom of this slide. First, we expect the acquisition to be accretive with growing earnings, adding to returns and total profit. Second, we expect to achieve synergies by consolidating the three IA channel businesses into one, improving our competitive position. Third, we'll grow IA channel policies in force by broadening the product offering to fully meet customer needs for auto, home, other personal lines and from nonstandard to middle market to mass affluent. We'll continue to provide updates on our success in this channel as we report our National General brand results in the first quarter. Moving to Slide 8, let's go deeper into how we've strengthened Allstate branded property liability distribution. As we said before, some of the actions we took in 2020 negatively impacted near term growth while accelerating it in other areas. We supported Allstate agents to increase new business growth in 2020 with the exception of March and April, the beginning of the pandemic when things slowed down. At the same time, we stopped appointing new Allstate agents while higher growth and lower cost models are being developed, and that had a negative impact on new business. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we expect the new models are going to create learnings that enable our existing agents to achieve higher growth too. The chart on the lower left breaks down Allstate's personal auto new business applications compared to the prior year. If you exclude the declines in March and April due to the pandemic, Allstate brand new business increased with an improving trajectory throughout the year. The red bar on the far left of the chart shows the estimated unfavorable impact of the pandemic on new business in March and April. Moving to the right, you can see the negative impact of stopping new agent appointments during 2020, but that was partially offset by an increase in existing EA production. And that shows the viability of growth with those existing agents when we just made a slight compensation change towards new business from renewal. They just have a great opportunity to grow. Moving to the center of the chart. The total direct channel increased compared to prior year, and this is the combined Allstate and Esurance view. And it's because Allstate brand direct applications more than offset the decline in Esurance brand, that reflects the redirection of branding investments and resources from Esurance to Allstate brand. We expect continued growth in the direct channel as we optimize web and call center sales capabilities. A relatively small number of independent agents operate under the Allstate brand and had a small positive impact on overall growth but a really nice percentage increase among that group. And it highlights the growth opportunity we have going forward in the IA channel as we transition those appointments to National General over time, expand National General's product offerings upmarket and endorse the brand as an Allstate company. The overall Allstate and Esurance policies in force maintained prior year levels in 2020 as we manage through significant change in our operating model and had a small decrease in retention levels, which you can see all of that in the lower right. Total property liability policies in force declined slightly driven by the Encompass brand, which will be integrated in the National General's platform in 2021. Now I'll turn it over to Mario to discuss the rest of our quarterly results.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Glenn. Let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the performance of our property liability business. Property liability results remained strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Net written premium declined in the fourth quarter by 1.5%. While homeowners premium grew 3.2% from the prior year quarter due to average premium and policy growth, this was more than offset by a modest decline in auto insurance premiums, driven by premium refunds. Underwriting income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.4 billion for the full year increased relative to the prior year by $420 million and $1.6 billion respectively. As shown in the chart on the lower left, the recorded combined ratio of 84 in the fourth quarter improved 4.7 points compared to the prior year. This improvement was primarily attributable to a lower underlying loss ratio in auto insurance, driven by fewer auto accidents, partially offset by higher auto insurance claim severity and a slightly adverse underlying loss ratio in homeowners insurance compared to prior year. Homeowners continues to generate attractive returns with a recorded combined ratio of 78.5 in the fourth quarter and 90 for the full year 2020. Additionally, the underlying combined ratio performance has consistently achieved our low 60s target, which speaks to our expertise in managing this business. Favorable underlying loss ratios were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses along with restructuring charges related to transformative growth. The underwriting expense ratio improved 0.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, which reflects a 0.6 point improvement in the expense ratio, excluding restructuring costs, partially offset by 0.4 points of restructuring. As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, when excluding restructuring charges and impacts from actions taken as a result of coronavirus, the expense ratio improved 1 point in 2020 and 1.9 points over the past two years, demonstrating continued progress toward the goal of reducing our cost structure to maintain returns while improving the competitive price position of auto insurance. Shifting to Slide 10. Let's discuss protection services, which were formerly known as our service businesses. Protection Services revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 17.5% to $497 million in the fourth quarter, reaching $1.9 billion for the full year. Allstate Protection plans continued to deliver significant growth, ending the year with nearly $1 billion in revenue. Policies in force increased 28.6% to $136 million, driven by Allstate Protection plans. As shown in the table on the bottom right, adjusted net income was $38 million in the fourth quarter and $153 million for the full year, representing increases compared to the prior year of $35 million and $115 million respectively. The increase in both periods was driven by growth of Allstate Protection plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services. Now let's turn to Slide 11, which highlights investment performance for the fourth quarter. The chart on the left shows net investment income totaled nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter, which was $502 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance based income. Performance based income totaled $557 million in the fourth quarter, as shown in gray, primarily from higher private equity valuations and gains from sales of underlying investments. Market based income, shown in blue, was $63 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest bearing portfolio yield, reducing income. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. Our 2020 portfolio return totaled 7.1%, reflecting income generation and higher fixed income and public equity valuations. Our performance based investment return was 7% for the quarter and 4.9% for the full year. Our performance based strategy has a longer term investment horizon and higher but more volatile return expectations compared to the market based portfolio. The compound annual rate of return on the performance based portfolio is 8.8% over the past five years, as shown in the bottom right of the table, exceeding the market based portfolio return by 330 basis points. Let's move now to Slide 12 and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life, shown on the left, recorded adjusted net income of $56 million in the fourth quarter, $20 million below the prior year, primarily driven by higher contract benefits as coronavirus death claims totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $34 million in the fourth quarter was $18 million higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting lower benefit utilization, likely due to the coronavirus and the nonrenewal of a large underperforming account in 2019. Allstate Annuities had adjusted net income of $160 million in the fourth quarter, attributable to strong investment income generated from the performance based portfolio. Starting in the first quarter of this year, the majority of the Allstate Life and Annuities business will be classified as held for sale on our balance sheet and results will be presented as discontinued operations following our recently announced agreement to sell Allstate Life Insurance company. Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate returns that are among the highest in the insurance industry with an adjusted net income return on equity of 19.8%. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth, a capital deployment strategy which leads to increased shareholder value. Investing in growth opportunities remains a priority, as evidenced by our investments in building higher growth models and completing the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We also continue to provide cash returns to shareholders. In September, Allstate executed a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. And upon completion on January 12, $1.45 billion remains on the $3 billion common share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of 2021. We returned $2.4 billion to common shareholders in 2020 through a combination of $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $668 million in common stock dividends. Last week, we announced the pending sale of Allstate Life Insurance company which will enable us to redeploy up to $2.2 billion of capital out of lower growth and return businesses with minimal impact to our two part strategy. With that context, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America.\nJoshShanker: One thing that really didn't get expressed maybe you can talk about is the extent to which we're seeing buydowns to like pay per mile products and whatnot, or unbundling is going on that you're keeping the homeowners and not the auto. To what extent is it customer being shrinking their wallet with Allstate taking place in this transition?\nTomWilson: Josh, this is Tom. I'll start and then get Glenn to talk a little bit about Milewise and our success there. First, we don't really see an unbundling. I know you mentioned that in your report. Our actually bundling percentage went up. That doesn't mean that it's not happening and we just don't see it, but we're seeing our bundling actually go up, as it relates to the buying down and sort of getting lower average premium. I think what you're seeing is through telematics is more accurate prices, the way I would describe it. And so if you look at the total revenues we take in and then what we pay out, we, as Glenn showed, consistently made money in auto insurance for a long period of time. That will change by customer. So if somebody gets Milewise and they only drive 2,000 miles a year and pay less, then there will be somebody else who will have to charge more. So we maintain that overall profitability. So we see it as a good thing that people get the most accurate price, particularly since we're more sophisticated than most of the industry, and we have some of the tools like telematics. Glenn, what would you add to either bundling or telematics?\nGlennShapiro: I think on the bundling side, I would look at as it actually -- I'd flip it the way Tom did there, we\u2019re actually seeing some increase in bundling, and I think that's helping our homeowners. So part of the story and the homeowners growth, it's only part because we got a lot of good parts of the story and homeowners there is bundling. In terms of Milewise and Drivewise, I'll talk about both of them, we definitely see increased demand. So right now, we have Milewise available to 45% of the market and we're continuing this year to roll out to more states. And we have Drivewise just about everybody is one state that doesn't allow it. But the demand for telematics has gone significantly up. Milewise, for example, admittedly a relatively small base, but was up 35% in terms of sales. So people are looking at the pandemic. They're not driving as much. We're advertising it a little bit. And we're getting a lot of people interested in the notion of pay by mile. From a Drivewise standpoint, most people really want to now include the telematics as part of their offering from us. So we're seeing a nice upswing on the demand post pandemic.\nJoshShanker: I'm going to try and digest all that and figure out how it works. If we can go to the slides you prepared on Page 8, you have this very interesting slide about new issued applications. I'm trying to understand it a little bit better. First of all, when it says Allstate brand direct submissions were up but Esurance was down. Is that four months of Allstate brand direct and eight months of Esurance? When we should think about that, that not only is Allstate brand bring in more customers than Esurance but it's a smaller time line. Is this the right way to think about that?\nTomWilson: No, those numbers are for the entire year. And what we're trying to show there is that we've successfully made the transition to the Allstate brand selling direct, both operationally, which wasn't simple, by the way, in terms of changing web flows and all kinds of other stuff. They're getting the branding changed and putting the price discount in if you buy direct under the Allstate brand because it doesn't come with an agent. So we've made that change. And what that shows is that overall, we grew. We did keep selling some under the Esurance brand those companies because they're open, people call, get on our Web site, they track their way down to it. So it's really low cost business. So we didn't completely shut off, Josh, the Esurance. So you can still buy. Over time, it will go away as we cut advertising it and quit doing and people could come into that Web site. So what it's really trying to show there is that we've made the turn indirect, and we feel good about our ability to operate under 1 brand, and there were many people who didn't think that was possible, whether that was perceived channel conflict or just operational capabilities.\nJoshShanker: And then on the EA channel part, a significant portion of annual new policies coming through the EA channel coming from new appointments? If we don't do a lot of new appointments going forward, should we expect that's a multiyear issue in terms of growth in the EA channel?\nTomWilson: I don't think you should think it's a multiyear issue. Obviously, Glenn mentioned we are working on creating some new higher growth models, and he can talk you through that in a second here. The part that may not be as obvious is putting Allstate agents onboarding with the old model, the commissions were substantially higher than you pay to an existing agent. And the idea being if you open an office and you got nobody coming in you sell the first policy, you need to make some money, and the commissions were quite high there. What Glenn is working on is coming up with a model where an agent can build the business and be successful without us having to incur the additional cost upfront to build it, which kind of rolled out over three to five years, it was expensive. And so what we thought -- what we made was the economic choice, which was save shareholder money, don't keep investing in a model that you think you get a better one for and then make sure the existing agents continue to grow. Glenn, do you want to talk about the new agents and then what you've done with the existing agents as well?\nGlennShapiro: And I always want to emphasize on this. Our exclusive agents are a huge strategic advantage for us and a core capability for Allstate. As much as we talk about and I'm excited about the direct growth and what we can do in the independent agent channel, a large, large channel out there and a lot of customers really like to go to a local agent and a branded agent like an Allstate agent to go there. So it's a great model for us and we want those agents to keep winning. So what we've done with existing agents is, as you know, we've shifted compensation a little bit, we've motivated more on the new business side than just on the renewal side. But we're also working with them on the way we market. We're putting more money into marketing. We really want them to be successful. From a new agent standpoint, we've got a few models in market right now. And without going too detailed into it, the general theme would be, if you think about the virtual world we're operating in, can you have a local agent that doesn't really require brick and mortar? And we think the answer is yes to that. That there's an opportunity for agents to be a local point of sale, people who are active in the community, people who have relationships locally and sell through those relationships in their communities, but don't necessarily have a staff and have a brick and mortar office where we perform the back end service in a more centralized way. It's a significantly lower cost model to get started, as Tom mentioned, and one that we're pretty bullish on our ability to scale.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.\nGregPeters: My first question is around price and competitive positioning. Obviously, we're listening to when watching the new products that you're rolling out the product enhancements and the focus on profitable growth. Your underlying combined ratio for the year is 79.3% is obviously a very excellent result. But do you think that your price for your Allstate brand auto is competitive in the marketplace considering how profitable the business is at the moment?\nTomWilson: The answer is yes. That we think we can be even more competitive. It's a complicated question, of course, because with billions of price points, and some segments you're not competitive at all because you don't want to be competitive because you think that somebody else is under charging and other places you want to be competitive. And the trick is where you want to be competitive, to be competitive enough to win the business but not so competitive that you're giving away margin. And so we have a very sophisticated approach of doing that. We do think that we can change our pricing so we can be more competitive overall. But yes, we look at our close rates and we're right in the market. And that depends how we carry ourself too. So if you look at us versus other people who have exclusive agents [Technical Difficulty] in general, we're very competitive. If you look at us versus direct, I'd say we're less so, which is why we made the change to put in a direct discount on that business. So we are more competitive because people are not getting an agent, they don't want to pay for one. So I would say we're highly competitive. That said, I think we can always be better. And when you look at what drives customers\u2019 purchase price, a lot of it's the price, now you got to make sure you make enough money. And that's the trick. Glenn, anything you would add to that?\nGlennShapiro: Just a couple of things, I'll hit there. One would be, you mentioned, Tom, that close rates, like so we keep a really close eye and our close rates and our close rates have improved. Our new business is up. I mean you look at -- you're talking, Greg, auto but I'll say, auto and home, we were up 2% and 8% respectively, between on new business. So folks are buying the product and you really can't sell the product if you're out of the market from a competitive standpoint. So those are good signs that we are, but we're working to get more competitive. And the last point I'll make with it is, I always go back to this. We manage state by state. We have a talented group of state managers that like they've got their hands on the lever in each state and they're looking at the competitive position, specifically in that market. And as Tom said, on which types of business are we more or less competitive on younger drivers, older drivers, homeowners, not homeowners, married, not married all, all the different components in there, and they're pulling those levers and getting us as competitive as we can be while earning attractive returns.\nGregPeters: I'd like to pivot to the expense ratio. I think the chart you put on Slide 9 of your presentation and very strong improvement from 2018 to 2019 to 2020. So two part questions with the result and then going forward. How much of the 23.2 is benefited from reduced T&E because of lockdown? Or look at a different way, I know you've been focused on integrated services platform and other tools. Is it an expectation that you can drive further improvement in '21 and the expense ratio?\nTomWilson: So Mario has been our lead on cost reduction. Mario, do you want to take that?\nMarioRizzo: When you look at the expense ratio for the year and the improvements we made, we came into the year really focused on taking cost out of two principal areas. One was acquisition related costs and the other one was operating costs, which your T&E component is a part of that but those are people related costs and operations and those types of items. And that's really what's driven the improvement, once you take the noise of restructuring and pandemic related costs out of the equation. The improvement we've seen this year has really come from those two principal areas. We've actually spent a little more on marketing, like we said we would as well, but our reductions in those two areas have really created the space for us to increase our growth related investments. As we go forward, as we've said on past calls, our focus is on continuing to drive our cost structure down because it is a core part of our growth strategy. It's how we're going to be able to continue to improve our competitive positioning in terms of auto insurance pricing and continuing to deliver really attractive returns. So that's a core part of our strategy and our focus is to continue to drive that ratio down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.\nDavidMotemaden: Just a question, and I believe on one of the slides, you had just talked about how you had 94.4 average combined ratio in the auto business over the last five years excluding 2020. Obviously, 2020 is an abnormal year. But is that sort of a level you're comfortable getting back to in order to return to growth? And I guess, what sort of level are you willing to let that go to in order to accelerate growth?\nTomWilson: I think I would go up all the way up to the top and say that what we said is we can grow the market share on personal property liability and as a company we'll deliver 14% to 17% return on equity. And we believe that will drive lots of shareholder value, both in terms of economic value creation and valuation multiples. When you look specifically at the components of that, we have a headwind in investment income with low interest rates. We do have and have had for a long time great profitability in auto insurance. We would have put a longer period of time in there, but the pension accounting kind of changed the way we did it. But we've been earning great returns in the auto insurance business for a long time and expect to continue. At a 94, you still earn a really attractive return on equity because you don't have to put up as much capital on that line and some other lines. And so 94 would be the book -- we like to make as much money as we can and grow as fast as we can, and it's really about how do you drive net present value to the whole company. So we don't publish and have a target of safety there. But 94 would be a return I would be highly comfortable with. I'd be comfortable at 93, I'd be comfortable with 95. They're all really great returns. The other part to focus on is homeowners insurance where that's a higher capital return business and so we have a lower combined ratio there. And we're 10 to 15 points better than another large public competitor, which is somewhere between $700 million and $1 billion a year of profit. So we think all of those then add up to 14% to 17% return. So we're comfortable we can grow the business and earn good returns. And it will bounce around, as you mentioned this year, frequency went way down. So we made a bunch more money. If frequency goes back up, we'll just have to raise our prices up. And the question is are you good at it. And the point of putting those two statistics on the bottom of that page was just to give our shareholders comfort that we have a history of managing returns and profitability, and we expect to continue to do it. Not going to be the same every year because the world changes but we know how to make money.\nDavidMotemaden: And I guess just maybe switching gears a little bit to the new appointed agents, and thanks for the slide on Slide 8, that was very helpful. Some encouraging trends there. I guess I just wanted to ask on the new agents and appointments. Do you expect that to still be a drag in '21 or is that something that will turn from a drag to an addition to new apps and to growth? Or is that something that you expect to still be a little bit of a drag as these new models ramp up?\nTom Wilson: I'll make some overall comments, and then Glenn, you may want to make some comments. First, I would say that when you do these year-over-year comparisons and sometimes I feel like the external view of the company, you just look one year. And so next year, obviously, we won't have had them much for this year. So I would actually be a negative versus the prior year. That said, I think the transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost will have some bumps in it. That said, as you see, when the people we focus on, the existing agents that are doing well, they know how to grow. They know their local market, their aggressive salespeople, they have aggressive salespeople working for them. And so I don't know that it's as simple as like that's now gone and we get the new one. The new one we think should add additional volume for us, and Glenn can talk about how that will roll out. And then at the same time, the beauty of our strategy is as direct grows it keeps our advertising money highly effective because if we're not closing enough because through some agent changes, we can close more in direct. So we have a fallback. We don't think we need it but we got plenty of opportunity to balance between those. Glenn, do you want to talk about the -- I think the view is on the agents, we have a ways to go to actually figure it all out, but we're making good progress.\nGlennShapiro: I think if you think about that chart and you look across at the direct part, too, I think it's a similar story. I think 2020 is a story really good success. We've built the foundation in that year and actually managed to grow more on the Allstate side than we lost on the Esurance side. And so that's sort of an ideal scenario that while you're in the midst of the muck and the mire of making a change like that, that you actually are able to grow it. We absolutely are making that type of change within the EA system. As we've said, we've got a lot of agents out there that are phenomenal at what they do and they grow and we're going to invest with them and have them be successful, then we have a new model upcoming. I think the way to look at this is to across all three channels. With EAs, we will ramp up some time later this year some new models and through next year. And so there's that coming as well as work with the existing EAs that really know how to grow. With direct, we've really done a lot of the heavy lifting of making the transition and we should be able to continue to grow, and we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow it. With IA, which is really, for all intents and purposes, a bit of a new channel for us. I know we've had Encompass in the small Allstate independent agents in there. But really jumping into the top five will start like the first state will roll out in the third quarter of this year with new products going upmarket on the National General platform, National General and Allstate company platform, and then multiple states per month and like we'll be finished with the rollout across all 50 states through 2022. So you can kind of see all of these things coming together, and we're building a long term and sustainable growth platform across all of the channels.\nDavidMotemaden: And I think the new agent, the new EA agent strategy is -- I mean, it sounds actually really promising. I guess one question I have is, are those new agents -- I guess, the more remote exclusive agent, are they as productive as under the old brick and mortar model?\nTomWilson: I would say we don't know yet. But we do think it will be lower cost, if you want to look at it that way. You might have to have more people doing it. And then, David, you get a little bit of math because the existing agents also have salespeople in their office. So when you do it by agent but then these people might be so low producers. So net-net, we think we know over half the people want to buy from a person and having a person local is good. It's just the way we've traditionally done it hasn't given us as much growth and it's costs don't need to be as high as they are today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley.\nMichaelPhillips: You guys mentioned the impact on the end of the payment plans and the pandemic and retention and growth in the quarter. I guess, Part A of this, is there any way to quantify that? And what I want to get at is, if so, how much -- given that the EA is still in the bulk of your business, how much of was there a drag on retention because of things that you're doing with commissions and emphasis on direct and everything else that's going on? So can we quantify that impact, one and then how much of an impact if everything else was on retention?\nTomWilson: Well, Glenn can give you some detailed specifics on the year. Of course, retention is always hard to figure out, because you have a bunch of stuff going on, you have people changing lifestyle, not driving as much, some people shopping more, you have competitive moves, you have things that we did like shelter in place, payback and payment plan forgiveness -- not forgiveness, we just let you defer. And so as those things roll through the system, it's hard to do attribution on it. That said, it was down this year, which of course we're focused on. Our Net Promoter Score really peaked throughout the year. We got peaked in about July when we were doing all the shelter in place paybacks, it came down a little bit towards the end of the year, but not anything of any consequence or significance. Glenn, do you want to make a comment about the actual retention numbers?\nGlennShapiro: Yes. I don't know I can add a lot to what you said, Tom. I think you hit it well. I mean the retention is in a decent range right now. So it's off of our highs that we hit. But we're within a long term window on retention of where we've operated and certainly, all the things that Tom mentioned had a drag on it. We know that the coming due of special payment plans had some drag on it, and the competitive environment. We know that there were some competitors out there that took some rate down. We also know that people facing financial hardship either shop, some people even give up a car. So all of those things have some play in it. And as you said, Tom, the attribution is next to impossible on that. But we're within a decent range of our long term retention and we're focused on it. And of course, we want to retain every customer that we work hard to get in the first place.\nTomWilson: And I think if -- the underlying question there was are existing agents performing well enough to keep retention levels up or somehow made a mat or something like that, our answer there would be no. We don't see anything in there that says that existing agents are doing anything that they haven't done before, that they're not stepping up and helping their customers even more in the pandemic. I mean they really reached out tons of calls on shelter in place and the payment plans and that kind of stuff. So our agents were doing a great job. I don't think there's anything structurally in there as it relates to this transition that says we're not -- and I would point out that, that's a huge part of agent compensation. So their interests are aligned with our interest, which is keeping our customers happy.\nMichaelPhillips: Second question, still on kind of channel mix, near term and longer term question. In the near term, I guess, just this year, you talked about a 1 point change in market share. Should we expect that to be kind of even throughout the year or more back half weighted in terms of that market share shift? And then longer term, more interested in maybe 10 years down the road, what does Allstate look like? How does this mix look, a third, a third, a third or something still weighted towards EA and IA?\nTomWilson: We closed National General on January 4th. So that in and of itself means we'll get that revenue for the entire year. So you should expect to see total auto premiums go up throughout the year. We would expect that as we continue to roll out things in the Allstate brand that we start to see some more growth in that business over time. And yes, but we don't really give it out even do it by quarter, just as much as you can. In terms of the long term, we'll take anybody we can get. So we have one out of 10. We still got nine out of 10 to go. I'd be happy if all of them got a lot bigger and that's what we're setting up to do. So we don't have a percentage. When you look at percentages from what customers want, it's probably today, 25% of the customers really prefer self serve and it's a range. If you look at those who want an agent, it's over 50% and usually around 65% or about 60%. And then in between, you have people who are sort of -- they go with whatever is in front of them and they're indifferent. So we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow. Some of the shift you see in channels is really due to customers wanting it differently, like not feeling like they need help to buy the product. Some of the shift is just because direct companies have been advertising more. So you all loud enough and people come to you. So we think what we should do is give people exactly what they want, give them choice. And what they want with the person is really to help buy it. They need and want less help on service. And so the existing insurance agent businesses have been built on both. What we're trying to focus on is really helping them buy and then give them self serve or have computers do it or whatever to lower the cost on the service side because it's cheaper, better and faster. So we don't need to do as much local service as we do. So we'll take as many people as we can get through any channel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.\nPaulNewsome: I was hoping you could maybe help us understand a little bit more about how the investment portfolio will look after the life sale? Will the P&C business kind of have a little bit of a different mix of assets and will that have an impact on the yield as well?\nTomWilson: Paul, let me give you a slight overview from a corporate standpoint, and John can talk about the specifics. So obviously, the sale of Allstate Life Insurance company substantially reduces our investment portfolio as we exit a spread-based business. And the [Indiscernible] entity is taking almost all the assets that are used to asset liability match that business. They are not taking all of the performance based assets. So that increases the percentage relative to the overall portfolio, which also gets smaller. And we looked at it, obviously, prior to the sale. We're comfortable with the risk and return of it. You will remember that we reduced our equity holdings in February this year by $4 billion, not because of the Allstate Life sale but because we just didn't like the risk and return profile there. So we do make changes up and down. And this will still have the ability to go up and down even though this portion of the portfolio is less liquid than the public equity as a whole because we still have public equities we get high yields. We have a bunch of ways we can manage the overall risk of the portfolio, and we're very comfortable with where we'll be. John, do you want to talk specifically about [performance] basis?\nJohnDugenske: When you look at performance space, too, it's part of a broader overall portfolio context. So while that percentage will go up, we look across risk and return factors across every security and every investment we hold and take it in its entirety. So as Tom mentioned, we have a lot of ways to compensate for additional risk we may take in one area. When you look at the performance space, this is a long term holding for us, we've looked at gradually growing that over multiple years. And in some ways, this just accelerates that gradual path that we're on. As we built this portfolio, we've always looked for the best partners and the best direct investments we can across private equity, real estate and other areas. And the assets that we'd be bringing on board are ones that we're already very familiar with. We already own them, obviously, and very familiar. So it accelerates our path forward in a way that we're quite comfortable with. And, I guess, I\u2019d just finish by saying that the return on this has stood up quite well even in what's been a volatile year. We've been looking back at what our returns have been over the last five years and 10 years, and our performance based assets have fared quite well relative to public markets, and we think that it continues to be an integral part of the portfolio.\nTomWilson: Jonathan, let's take one last question and then we'll wrap up to keep people on time.\nOperator: Our final question for today then comes from the line of Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners.\nGaryRansom: I wanted to loop back on telematics. You mentioned increased demand for the product. A couple of questions there. Did that make any material difference to the growth in new business that you're seeing that roll forward you showed on Slide 8? And then secondly, whether the difference between your by the mile product and the standard product, whether the demand is different. And with that question, I'm really just trying to think ahead is to buy the mile product more the way of the future.\nTomWilson: Gary, let me make a couple of comments. First, I don't believe it's actually driven people to us. So I think with our advertising when they get to us, and then we talk to them about it, so that's interesting. And what it enables us to is give them a more accurate price, which protects them competitively. So the more accurate the price they are -- if someone takes them away from us, and we're really accurate through a lower price, then they'll we think, lose money. And we won't lose people because we're overpriced for the risk. So it will drive more sustainability to growth as opposed to people calling us and saying, hey, I want to. That doesn't mean people don't see our ads and say, geez, I'm tired of paying this much for insurance, and I hardly drive sort cost. But I'm not seeing a big well spring of people saying cost, it tends to be more in the sale itself. In terms of a long-term basis, I think this is the way that pricing will be done. I mean insurers for a long time have been trying to get more and more accurate on the individual risk, particularly in auto insurance and home insurance for that matter, of course, going to telematics here. But as credit was a big move, I don't know, 15 or 20 years ago when we first got into that using stuff out of the credit file and is very powerful. This is very powerful, as powerful, not so much in the fat part of the curve, they're being moderate risk people. But in really low risk or really high risk people, it's very effective. So I think it will lead to more sustainable growth through better retention because we'll have a really accurate and competitive price.\nGaryRansom: Can you also talk a little bit about how you might be using telematics on the claims side, whether that is developing or having much effect at this point?\nTomWilson: Glenn, do you want to take that?\nGlennShapiro: So we've got some capability there that is, I would call it, developing. And it's about accident notification. And I think this is -- Tom talked about it being the wave of the future for pricing, which I totally agree with from the telematics. I think it's going to be the wave of the future. When you think about connected cars, you think about our devices in OBD ports or even the mobile, there's accident detection through Arity through the mobile telematics. So early notification, emergency notification, first notice of loss taking are all areas in development, and I think will be a wave of the future.\nTomWilson: Gary, I would expand on that and say, if you go to digital claims settlement, we believe we've been leading the industry, whether that's a quick photo claim, whether that's using algorithms to look at pictures and decide how you should settle the claim. I know another company is talking about going into a SPAC and raising some money. We've worked extensively with that company. We think our platform, our technology and the ability to utilize data will make us even better at settling claims. So it's not really related to telematics but it's really related to digitization of the business, which is another way that we're trying to change both our business model and really our culture, with just to drive that kind of growth. So thank you all for participating. We are trying to build really transformational growth business models. It's more than a plan. It's really a way of life. And we expect to deliver increased growth and earn good returns, which will both create economic value just because we make more money and should lead to higher valuation multiples. Thank you much. We'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Glenn Shapiro",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Slide 6. We'll discuss how Allstate is increasing property liability market share while maintaining attractive returns. With the foundational work completed in 2020, Allstate is positioned to grow market share in '21 while developing a leading position in all three primary distribution channels in property liability. Some of the actions taken in '20 have impacted growth in the near term but they were critical to advancing transformative growth in the longer term. Starting with Allstate exclusive agents who serve customers that value local advice and relationships, we're focused on accelerating growth and improving efficiency. Allstate agents continue to be a core strength of our organization. We're further strengthening that model by focusing on new business growth and lowering costs by improving marketing effectiveness, centralizing customer services and enhancing customer connectivity. Leveraging Esurance's direct capabilities under the Allstate brand, we've created an omnichannel experience that meets the customer where, how and when they want to interact with us. We completed the integration of direct processes and systems in 2020 and expect direct sold business to continue to accelerate. As Tom mentioned, National General is another exciting growth platform for us. I mean National General's independent agent facing technology, it's among the best in the industry and then our combined agency footprint covers the vast majority of the US market. So as we expand products on the National General platform, we're going to be in a position to grow share in the IA channel. The totality of this go to market model with strong capabilities in each distribution channel is designed to generate higher growth. Allstate's leading pricing and claims capabilities, including our strength in telematics, puts us in a strong competitive position. We're also enhancing our price competitiveness while maintaining attractive returns. The impact of the pandemic on miles driven and lower costs for auto losses gave us an opportunity to improve auto affordability through targeted rate reductions. We've also lowered underwriting expenses, as Tom mentioned. They're down 1.9 points over the last two years when excluding restructuring and coronavirus related expenses. These efficiencies and continued cost structure reductions allow us to improve pricing relative to competitors while generating excellent returns. Allstate has a strong record of profitability across lines of business and in different market conditions. The average combined ratio in auto insurance over the last five years was 94.4, and that excludes, obviously, 2020 results, which were influenced by the pandemic. We're equally strong at homeowners, where we averaged a combined ratio of 89.5 over the last five years. And that reflects the higher cost of capital or the higher capital requirements, I should say, in homeowners product versus auto. The point is we expect to grow and we expect to earn really attractive returns. So let's go to Slide 7, and we're going to discuss National General, the acquisition in a little more detail. On January 4th, Allstate closed the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead with National General and how this advances our strategy to grow personal lines. And it gives us an estimated increase of over 1 percentage point of total personal property liability market share. Allstate is now a top five personal lines carrier in the IA channel with significantly better competitive position. We utilize National General as our independent agent platform by consolidating our encompass and Allstate independent agency operations into the new entity, which will be branded National General and Allstate company. We expect to grow by rolling out new standard auto and homeowners insurance offerings starting later this year and completing countrywide deployment in less than two years. Consistent with past acquisitions, we've developed measures of success and we're showing those in the bottom of this slide. First, we expect the acquisition to be accretive with growing earnings, adding to returns and total profit. Second, we expect to achieve synergies by consolidating the three IA channel businesses into one, improving our competitive position. Third, we'll grow IA channel policies in force by broadening the product offering to fully meet customer needs for auto, home, other personal lines and from nonstandard to middle market to mass affluent. We'll continue to provide updates on our success in this channel as we report our National General brand results in the first quarter. Moving to Slide 8, let's go deeper into how we've strengthened Allstate branded property liability distribution. As we said before, some of the actions we took in 2020 negatively impacted near term growth while accelerating it in other areas. We supported Allstate agents to increase new business growth in 2020 with the exception of March and April, the beginning of the pandemic when things slowed down. At the same time, we stopped appointing new Allstate agents while higher growth and lower cost models are being developed, and that had a negative impact on new business. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we expect the new models are going to create learnings that enable our existing agents to achieve higher growth too. The chart on the lower left breaks down Allstate's personal auto new business applications compared to the prior year. If you exclude the declines in March and April due to the pandemic, Allstate brand new business increased with an improving trajectory throughout the year. The red bar on the far left of the chart shows the estimated unfavorable impact of the pandemic on new business in March and April. Moving to the right, you can see the negative impact of stopping new agent appointments during 2020, but that was partially offset by an increase in existing EA production. And that shows the viability of growth with those existing agents when we just made a slight compensation change towards new business from renewal. They just have a great opportunity to grow. Moving to the center of the chart. The total direct channel increased compared to prior year, and this is the combined Allstate and Esurance view. And it's because Allstate brand direct applications more than offset the decline in Esurance brand, that reflects the redirection of branding investments and resources from Esurance to Allstate brand. We expect continued growth in the direct channel as we optimize web and call center sales capabilities. A relatively small number of independent agents operate under the Allstate brand and had a small positive impact on overall growth but a really nice percentage increase among that group. And it highlights the growth opportunity we have going forward in the IA channel as we transition those appointments to National General over time, expand National General's product offerings upmarket and endorse the brand as an Allstate company. The overall Allstate and Esurance policies in force maintained prior year levels in 2020 as we manage through significant change in our operating model and had a small decrease in retention levels, which you can see all of that in the lower right. Total property liability policies in force declined slightly driven by the Encompass brand, which will be integrated in the National General's platform in 2021. Now I'll turn it over to Mario to discuss the rest of our quarterly results. I think on the bundling side, I would look at as it actually -- I'd flip it the way Tom did there, we're actually seeing some increase in bundling, and I think that's helping our homeowners. So part of the story and the homeowners growth, it's only part because we got a lot of good parts of the story and homeowners there is bundling. In terms of Milewise and Drivewise, I'll talk about both of them, we definitely see increased demand. So right now, we have Milewise available to 45% of the market and we're continuing this year to roll out to more states. And we have Drivewise just about everybody is one state that doesn't allow it. But the demand for telematics has gone significantly up. Milewise, for example, admittedly a relatively small base, but was up 35% in terms of sales. So people are looking at the pandemic. They're not driving as much. We're advertising it a little bit. And we're getting a lot of people interested in the notion of pay by mile. From a Drivewise standpoint, most people really want to now include the telematics as part of their offering from us. So we're seeing a nice upswing on the demand post pandemic. And I always want to emphasize on this. Our exclusive agents are a huge strategic advantage for us and a core capability for Allstate. As much as we talk about and I'm excited about the direct growth and what we can do in the independent agent channel, a large, large channel out there and a lot of customers really like to go to a local agent and a branded agent like an Allstate agent to go there. So it's a great model for us and we want those agents to keep winning. So what we've done with existing agents is, as you know, we've shifted compensation a little bit, we've motivated more on the new business side than just on the renewal side. But we're also working with them on the way we market. We're putting more money into marketing. We really want them to be successful. From a new agent standpoint, we've got a few models in market right now. And without going too detailed into it, the general theme would be, if you think about the virtual world we're operating in, can you have a local agent that doesn't really require brick and mortar? And we think the answer is yes to that. That there's an opportunity for agents to be a local point of sale, people who are active in the community, people who have relationships locally and sell through those relationships in their communities, but don't necessarily have a staff and have a brick and mortar office where we perform the back end service in a more centralized way. It's a significantly lower cost model to get started, as Tom mentioned, and one that we're pretty bullish on our ability to scale. Just a couple of things, I'll hit there. One would be, you mentioned, Tom, that close rates, like so we keep a really close eye and our close rates and our close rates have improved. Our new business is up. I mean you look at -- you're talking, Greg, auto but I'll say, auto and home, we were up 2% and 8% respectively, between on new business. So folks are buying the product and you really can't sell the product if you're out of the market from a competitive standpoint. So those are good signs that we are, but we're working to get more competitive. And the last point I'll make with it is, I always go back to this. We manage state by state. We have a talented group of state managers that like they've got their hands on the lever in each state and they're looking at the competitive position, specifically in that market. And as Tom said, on which types of business are we more or less competitive on younger drivers, older drivers, homeowners, not homeowners, married, not married all, all the different components in there, and they're pulling those levers and getting us as competitive as we can be while earning attractive returns. I think if you think about that chart and you look across at the direct part, too, I think it's a similar story. I think 2020 is a story really good success. We've built the foundation in that year and actually managed to grow more on the Allstate side than we lost on the Esurance side. And so that's sort of an ideal scenario that while you're in the midst of the muck and the mire of making a change like that, that you actually are able to grow it. We absolutely are making that type of change within the EA system. As we've said, we've got a lot of agents out there that are phenomenal at what they do and they grow and we're going to invest with them and have them be successful, then we have a new model upcoming. I think the way to look at this is to across all three channels. With EAs, we will ramp up some time later this year some new models and through next year. And so there's that coming as well as work with the existing EAs that really know how to grow. With direct, we've really done a lot of the heavy lifting of making the transition and we should be able to continue to grow, and we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow it. With IA, which is really, for all intents and purposes, a bit of a new channel for us. I know we've had Encompass in the small Allstate independent agents in there. But really jumping into the top five will start like the first state will roll out in the third quarter of this year with new products going upmarket on the National General platform, National General and Allstate company platform, and then multiple states per month and like we'll be finished with the rollout across all 50 states through 2022. So you can kind of see all of these things coming together, and we're building a long term and sustainable growth platform across all of the channels. Yes. I don't know I can add a lot to what you said, Tom. I think you hit it well. I mean the retention is in a decent range right now. So it's off of our highs that we hit. But we're within a long term window on retention of where we've operated and certainly, all the things that Tom mentioned had a drag on it. We know that the coming due of special payment plans had some drag on it, and the competitive environment. We know that there were some competitors out there that took some rate down. We also know that people facing financial hardship either shop, some people even give up a car. So all of those things have some play in it. And as you said, Tom, the attribution is next to impossible on that. But we're within a decent range of our long term retention and we're focused on it. And of course, we want to retain every customer that we work hard to get in the first place. So we've got some capability there that is, I would call it, developing.

And, I guess, I'd just finish by saying that the return on this has stood up quite well even in what's been a volatile year. We've been looking back at what our returns have been over the last five years and 10 years, and our performance based assets have fared quite well relative to public markets, and we think that it continues to be an integral part of the portfolio."

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Amidst the pandemic Allstate delivered really attractive returns while building higher growth business models in 2020, exceptional progress has made building higher growth business models to execute our strategy of increasing market share in personal property liability, and expanding protections offered to its customers. And as you know, one of our key focuses this year was transitioning the personal property liability business to higher growth. We took decisive actions and despite the operational complexity of these actions maintained Allstate brand property liability policies in force. We'll take you through a reconciliation of the various components of this and you'll see the path to growth. We've made excellent progress in expanding protection offered to customers with total policies in force increasing by 20.5% to nearly 176 million. We took advantage of the decline in auto accident frequency and our cost reductions to improve our competitive price position in auto insurance while maintaining attractive returns. The acquisition of National General is expected to increase auto insurers market share by 1 percentage point in 2021 and provides another platform for growth as we expand its product breadth. These changes position Allstate have sustainable long term growth. At the same time, Allstate generated strong profitability and returns in 2020. Net income was $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share. This was driven by lower frequency of auto accident, continued strong profitability of homeowners insurance and higher performance based investment income. Net income was $5.5 billion and adjusted net income was $4.6 billion for the year. This represents a 19.8% return on equity far in excess of most insurance companies. Our strategy is to increase market share in personal property liability while expanding protection services to customers will increase shareholder value. Higher property liability growth with attractive returns, rapidly growing protection services expand our total addressable market. And this growth, combined with our proactive capital deployment strategy, supports returns on equity above the insurance industry and are comparable to the S&P 500. Slide 3 is there to touch base on the strategy and so we're not going to spend time on that. So let's move to Slide 4 and discuss this strategy as it relates to the property liability business. A transformative growth has become more than a [plan], it's about creating a business model, capabilities and culture that continually transform to deliver market share growth. This is done by focusing on the customer, expanding access and improving value. Expanding access includes all the ways customers choose to interact, exclusive agents directly through call centers to the web and independent agents. The largest part of this change was transitioning our exclusive agent and direct businesses that operate under the Allstate brand. This gave us the ability to lower costs, leverage scale and increase advertising. This transaction is successfully being implemented, and we achieved key milestones in 2020. We were pleased with new business growth from existing Allstate agents who remain key to serving our customers and growing. Property liability business from existing agents met our goals, except for the pandemic slowdown in March and April where, of course, nobody was buying anything, as we shifted commission to new sales from retention. We're testing new agent models with less real estate and more efficient service enabled by technology with the goal of having strong local personal relationships with customers. These models will also create learnings to enable existing agents to achieve higher growth. As a result of that, we did stop appointing new Allstate agents in early 2020 while a higher growth in lower cost models being developed. This had a negative impact on points of presence and new business sales. At the same time, we increased direct sales. The net was that overall policies in force remained the same through the transition despite a drop in retention, which was concurrent with the ending of the special payment plans related to the pandemic. Glenn will take you through that reconciliation in a couple of minutes. The acquisition of National General in January also improves growth prospects. And as you know, this is essentially a reverse merger. The National General team is joining Allstate and they're consolidating our independent agent businesses, encompassing AIA into their operational and technology platform. Then we're going to be able to broaden National General's product portfolio using Allstate standard auto and homeowners insurance capabilities, which will create growth through independent agents. We also made great progress at improving customer value last year. From a customer value standpoint, we've maintained attractive margins through cost reductions while investing in growth. This includes improving the competitive price position of auto insurance through targeted rate reductions and a direct pricing discount. And while most of these changes are due to the lower frequency of auto actions, we are also reducing cost to ensure we continue to generate attractive margins. We're also expanding our industry leading telematics offerings, Drivewise and Milewise, to further improve our value proposition and improving its pricing expectations. We're the only company that major companies selling Milewise, which is very attractive to customers today because they're not driving as much. Our goal is not just to execute this plan but to continually generate transformational growth. We have the brand, market position, resources, capabilities and strategy to deliver this for shareholders. An extensive Allstate agent platform delivers more value per dollar to customers and competitors; a direct business utilizing the Allstate brand, competitive prices, broad product offerings and our insurance expertise; an independent agent business with national distribution and strong position in both auto and homeowners insurance; and protection services with innovative business models and expanding total addressable markets. We're well on our way to achieving this goal after putting the foundational elements into place last year. Let's move to Slide 4 to discuss Allstate's excellent financial performance in 2020. Revenues of $12 billion in the fourth quarter increased 4.8% to the prior year quarter, with total revenues for the year reaching $44.8 billion, which is primarily driven by higher premiums earned, which is partially offset then by lower net investment income. Net income was $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter and $5.5 billion for the full year 2020. Adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income increased to $4.6 billion or $14.73 per diluted share. We had strong profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance. Adjusted net income return on equity is 19.8% over the last 12 months, exceeding our range of 14% to 17%, which is near the top of the insurance industry. Now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the transition of the property liability businesses to higher growth. Josh, this is Tom. I'll start and then get Glenn to talk a little bit about Milewise and our success there. First, we don't really see an unbundling. I know you mentioned that in your report. Our actually bundling percentage went up. That doesn't mean that it's not happening and we just don't see it, but we're seeing our bundling actually go up, as it relates to the buying down and sort of getting lower average premium. I think what you're seeing is through telematics is more accurate prices, the way I would describe it. And so if you look at the total revenues we take in and then what we pay out, we, as Glenn showed, consistently made money in auto insurance for a long period of time. That will change by customer. So if somebody gets Milewise and they only drive 2,000 miles a year and pay less, then there will be somebody else who will have to charge more. So we maintain that overall profitability. So we see it as a good thing that people get the most accurate price, particularly since we're more sophisticated than most of the industry, and we have some of the tools like telematics. Glenn, what would you add to either bundling or telematics? No, those numbers are for the entire year. And what we're trying to show there is that we've successfully made the transition to the Allstate brand selling direct, both operationally, which wasn't simple, by the way, in terms of changing web flows and all kinds of other stuff. They're getting the branding changed and putting the price discount in if you buy direct under the Allstate brand because it doesn't come with an agent. So we've made that change. And what that shows is that overall, we grew. We did keep selling some under the Esurance brand those companies because they're open, people call, get on our Web site, they track their way down to it. So it's really low cost business. So we didn't completely shut off, Josh, the Esurance. So you can still buy. Over time, it will go away as we cut advertising it and quit doing and people could come into that Web site. So what it's really trying to show there is that we've made the turn indirect, and we feel good about our ability to operate under 1 brand, and there were many people who didn't think that was possible, whether that was perceived channel conflict or just operational capabilities. I don't think you should think it's a multiyear issue. Obviously, Glenn mentioned we are working on creating some new higher growth models, and he can talk you through that in a second here. The part that may not be as obvious is putting Allstate agents onboarding with the old model, the commissions were substantially higher than you pay to an existing agent. And the idea being if you open an office and you got nobody coming in you sell the first policy, you need to make some money, and the commissions were quite high there. What Glenn is working on is coming up with a model where an agent can build the business and be successful without us having to incur the additional cost upfront to build it, which kind of rolled out over three to five years, it was expensive. And so what we thought -- what we made was the economic choice, which was save shareholder money, don't keep investing in a model that you think you get a better one for and then make sure the existing agents continue to grow. Glenn, do you want to talk about the new agents and then what you've done with the existing agents as well? The answer is yes. That we think we can be even more competitive. It's a complicated question, of course, because with billions of price points, and some segments you're not competitive at all because you don't want to be competitive because you think that somebody else is under charging and other places you want to be competitive. And the trick is where you want to be competitive, to be competitive enough to win the business but not so competitive that you're giving away margin. And so we have a very sophisticated approach of doing that. We do think that we can change our pricing so we can be more competitive overall. But yes, we look at our close rates and we're right in the market. And that depends how we carry ourself too. So if you look at us versus other people who have exclusive agents [Technical Difficulty] in general, we're very competitive. If you look at us versus direct, I'd say we're less so, which is why we made the change to put in a direct discount on that business. So we are more competitive because people are not getting an agent, they don't want to pay for one. So I would say we're highly competitive. That said, I think we can always be better. And when you look at what drives customers' purchase price, a lot of it's the price, now you got to make sure you make enough money. And that's the trick. Glenn, anything you would add to that? So Mario has been our lead on cost reduction. Mario, do you want to take that? I think I would go up all the way up to the top and say that what we said is we can grow the market share on personal property liability and as a company we'll deliver 14% to 17% return on equity. And we believe that will drive lots of shareholder value, both in terms of economic value creation and valuation multiples. When you look specifically at the components of that, we have a headwind in investment income with low interest rates. We do have and have had for a long time great profitability in auto insurance. We would have put a longer period of time in there, but the pension accounting kind of changed the way we did it. But we've been earning great returns in the auto insurance business for a long time and expect to continue. At a 94, you still earn a really attractive return on equity because you don't have to put up as much capital on that line and some other lines. And so 94 would be the book -- we like to make as much money as we can and grow as fast as we can, and it's really about how do you drive net present value to the whole company. So we don't publish and have a target of safety there. But 94 would be a return I would be highly comfortable with. I'd be comfortable at 93, I'd be comfortable with 95. They're all really great returns. The other part to focus on is homeowners insurance where that's a higher capital return business and so we have a lower combined ratio there. And we're 10 to 15 points better than another large public competitor, which is somewhere between $700 million and $1 billion a year of profit. So we think all of those then add up to 14% to 17% return. So we're comfortable we can grow the business and earn good returns. And it will bounce around, as you mentioned this year, frequency went way down. So we made a bunch more money. If frequency goes back up, we'll just have to raise our prices up. And the question is are you good at it. And the point of putting those two statistics on the bottom of that page was just to give our shareholders comfort that we have a history of managing returns and profitability, and we expect to continue to do it. Not going to be the same every year because the world changes but we know how to make money. I'll make some overall comments, and then Glenn, you may want to make some comments. First, I would say that when you do these year-over-year comparisons and sometimes I feel like the external view of the company, you just look one year. And so next year, obviously, we won't have had them much for this year. So I would actually be a negative versus the prior year. That said, I think the transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost will have some bumps in it. That said, as you see, when the people we focus on, the existing agents that are doing well, they know how to grow. They know their local market, their aggressive salespeople, they have aggressive salespeople working for them. And so I don't know that it's as simple as like that's now gone and we get the new one. The new one we think should add additional volume for us, and Glenn can talk about how that will roll out. And then at the same time, the beauty of our strategy is as direct grows it keeps our advertising money highly effective because if we're not closing enough because through some agent changes, we can close more in direct. So we have a fallback. We don't think we need it but we got plenty of opportunity to balance between those. Glenn, do you want to talk about the -- I think the view is on the agents, we have a ways to go to actually figure it all out, but we're making good progress. I would say we don't know yet. But we do think it will be lower cost, if you want to look at it that way. You might have to have more people doing it. And then, David, you get a little bit of math because the existing agents also have salespeople in their office. So when you do it by agent but then these people might be so low producers. So net-net, we think we know over half the people want to buy from a person and having a person local is good. It's just the way we've traditionally done it hasn't given us as much growth and it's costs don't need to be as high as they are today. Well, Glenn can give you some detailed specifics on the year. Of course, retention is always hard to figure out, because you have a bunch of stuff going on, you have people changing lifestyle, not driving as much, some people shopping more, you have competitive moves, you have things that we did like shelter in place, payback and payment plan forgiveness -- not forgiveness, we just let you defer. And so as those things roll through the system, it's hard to do attribution on it. That said, it was down this year, which of course we're focused on. Our Net Promoter Score really peaked throughout the year. We got peaked in about July when we were doing all the shelter in place paybacks, it came down a little bit towards the end of the year, but not anything of any consequence or significance. Glenn, do you want to make a comment about the actual retention numbers? And I think if -- the underlying question there was are existing agents performing well enough to keep retention levels up or somehow made a mat or something like that, our answer there would be no. We don't see anything in there that says that existing agents are doing anything that they haven't done before, that they're not stepping up and helping their customers even more in the pandemic. I mean they really reached out tons of calls on shelter in place and the payment plans and that kind of stuff. So our agents were doing a great job. I don't think there's anything structurally in there as it relates to this transition that says we're not -- and I would point out that, that's a huge part of agent compensation. So their interests are aligned with our interest, which is keeping our customers happy. We closed National General on January 4th. So that in and of itself means we'll get that revenue for the entire year. So you should expect to see total auto premiums go up throughout the year. We would expect that as we continue to roll out things in the Allstate brand that we start to see some more growth in that business over time. And yes, but we don't really give it out even do it by quarter, just as much as you can. In terms of the long term, we'll take anybody we can get. So we have one out of 10. We still got nine out of 10 to go. I'd be happy if all of them got a lot bigger and that's what we're setting up to do. So we don't have a percentage. When you look at percentages from what customers want, it's probably today, 25% of the customers really prefer self serve and it's a range. If you look at those who want an agent, it's over 50% and usually around 65% or about 60%. And then in between, you have people who are sort of -- they go with whatever is in front of them and they're indifferent. So we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow. Some of the shift you see in channels is really due to customers wanting it differently, like not feeling like they need help to buy the product. Some of the shift is just because direct companies have been advertising more. So you all loud enough and people come to you. So we think what we should do is give people exactly what they want, give them choice. And what they want with the person is really to help buy it. They need and want less help on service. And so the existing insurance agent businesses have been built on both. What we're trying to focus on is really helping them buy and then give them self serve or have computers do it or whatever to lower the cost on the service side because it's cheaper, better and faster. So we don't need to do as much local service as we do. So we'll take as many people as we can get through any channel. Paul, let me give you a slight overview from a corporate standpoint, and John can talk about the specifics. So obviously, the sale of Allstate Life Insurance company substantially reduces our investment portfolio as we exit a spread-based business. And the [Indiscernible] entity is taking almost all the assets that are used to asset liability match that business. They are not taking all of the performance based assets. So that increases the percentage relative to the overall portfolio, which also gets smaller. And we looked at it, obviously, prior to the sale. We're comfortable with the risk and return of it. You will remember that we reduced our equity holdings in February this year by $4 billion, not because of the Allstate Life sale but because we just didn't like the risk and return profile there. So we do make changes up and down. And this will still have the ability to go up and down even though this portion of the portfolio is less liquid than the public equity as a whole because we still have public equities we get high yields. We have a bunch of ways we can manage the overall risk of the portfolio, and we're very comfortable with where we'll be. John, do you want to talk specifically about [performance] basis? Jonathan, let's take one last question and then we'll wrap up to keep people on time. Gary, let me make a couple of comments. First, I don't believe it's actually driven people to us. So I think with our advertising when they get to us, and then we talk to them about it, so that's interesting. And what it enables us to is give them a more accurate price, which protects them competitively. So the more accurate the price they are -- if someone takes them away from us, and we're really accurate through a lower price, then they'll we think, lose money. And we won't lose people because we're overpriced for the risk. So it will drive more sustainability to growth as opposed to people calling us and saying, hey, I want to. That doesn't mean people don't see our ads and say, geez, I'm tired of paying this much for insurance, and I hardly drive sort cost. But I'm not seeing a big well spring of people saying cost, it tends to be more in the sale itself. In terms of a long-term basis, I think this is the way that pricing will be done. I mean insurers for a long time have been trying to get more and more accurate on the individual risk, particularly in auto insurance and home insurance for that matter, of course, going to telematics here. But as credit was a big move, I don't know, 15 or 20 years ago when we first got into that using stuff out of the credit file and is very powerful. This is very powerful, as powerful, not so much in the fat part of the curve, they're being moderate risk people. But in really low risk or really high risk people, it's very effective. So I think it will lead to more sustainable growth through better retention because we'll have a really accurate and competitive price. Glenn, do you want to take that? Gary, I would expand on that and say, if you go to digital claims settlement, we believe we've been leading the industry, whether that's a quick photo claim, whether that's using algorithms to look at pictures and decide how you should settle the claim. I know another company is talking about going into a SPAC and raising some money. We've worked extensively with that company. We think our platform, our technology and the ability to utilize data will make us even better at settling claims. So it's not really related to telematics but it's really related to digitization of the business, which is another way that we're trying to change both our business model and really our culture, with just to drive that kind of growth. So thank you all for participating. We are trying to build really transformational growth business models. It's more than a plan. It's really a way of life. And we expect to deliver increased growth and earn good returns, which will both create economic value just because we make more money and should lead to higher valuation multiples. Thank you much. We'll talk to you next quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, Glenn. Let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the performance of our property liability business. Property liability results remained strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Net written premium declined in the fourth quarter by 1.5%. While homeowners premium grew 3.2% from the prior year quarter due to average premium and policy growth, this was more than offset by a modest decline in auto insurance premiums, driven by premium refunds. Underwriting income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.4 billion for the full year increased relative to the prior year by $420 million and $1.6 billion respectively. As shown in the chart on the lower left, the recorded combined ratio of 84 in the fourth quarter improved 4.7 points compared to the prior year. This improvement was primarily attributable to a lower underlying loss ratio in auto insurance, driven by fewer auto accidents, partially offset by higher auto insurance claim severity and a slightly adverse underlying loss ratio in homeowners insurance compared to prior year. Homeowners continues to generate attractive returns with a recorded combined ratio of 78.5 in the fourth quarter and 90 for the full year 2020. Additionally, the underlying combined ratio performance has consistently achieved our low 60s target, which speaks to our expertise in managing this business. Favorable underlying loss ratios were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses along with restructuring charges related to transformative growth. The underwriting expense ratio improved 0.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, which reflects a 0.6 point improvement in the expense ratio, excluding restructuring costs, partially offset by 0.4 points of restructuring. As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, when excluding restructuring charges and impacts from actions taken as a result of coronavirus, the expense ratio improved 1 point in 2020 and 1.9 points over the past two years, demonstrating continued progress toward the goal of reducing our cost structure to maintain returns while improving the competitive price position of auto insurance. Shifting to Slide 10. Let's discuss protection services, which were formerly known as our service businesses. Protection Services revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 17.5% to $497 million in the fourth quarter, reaching $1.9 billion for the full year. Allstate Protection plans continued to deliver significant growth, ending the year with nearly $1 billion in revenue. Policies in force increased 28.6% to $136 million, driven by Allstate Protection plans. As shown in the table on the bottom right, adjusted net income was $38 million in the fourth quarter and $153 million for the full year, representing increases compared to the prior year of $35 million and $115 million respectively. The increase in both periods was driven by growth of Allstate Protection plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services. Now let's turn to Slide 11, which highlights investment performance for the fourth quarter. The chart on the left shows net investment income totaled nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter, which was $502 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance based income. Performance based income totaled $557 million in the fourth quarter, as shown in gray, primarily from higher private equity valuations and gains from sales of underlying investments. Market based income, shown in blue, was $63 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest bearing portfolio yield, reducing income. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. Our 2020 portfolio return totaled 7.1%, reflecting income generation and higher fixed income and public equity valuations. Our performance based investment return was 7% for the quarter and 4.9% for the full year. Our performance based strategy has a longer term investment horizon and higher but more volatile return expectations compared to the market based portfolio. The compound annual rate of return on the performance based portfolio is 8.8% over the past five years, as shown in the bottom right of the table, exceeding the market based portfolio return by 330 basis points. Let's move now to Slide 12 and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life, shown on the left, recorded adjusted net income of $56 million in the fourth quarter, $20 million below the prior year, primarily driven by higher contract benefits as coronavirus death claims totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $34 million in the fourth quarter was $18 million higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting lower benefit utilization, likely due to the coronavirus and the nonrenewal of a large underperforming account in 2019. Allstate Annuities had adjusted net income of $160 million in the fourth quarter, attributable to strong investment income generated from the performance based portfolio. Starting in the first quarter of this year, the majority of the Allstate Life and Annuities business will be classified as held for sale on our balance sheet and results will be presented as discontinued operations following our recently announced agreement to sell Allstate Life Insurance company. Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate returns that are among the highest in the insurance industry with an adjusted net income return on equity of 19.8%. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth, a capital deployment strategy which leads to increased shareholder value. Investing in growth opportunities remains a priority, as evidenced by our investments in building higher growth models and completing the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We also continue to provide cash returns to shareholders. In September, Allstate executed a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. And upon completion on January 12, $1.45 billion remains on the $3 billion common share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of 2021. We returned $2.4 billion to common shareholders in 2020 through a combination of $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $668 million in common stock dividends. Last week, we announced the pending sale of Allstate Life Insurance company which will enable us to redeploy up to $2.2 billion of capital out of lower growth and return businesses with minimal impact to our two part strategy. With that context, let's open up the line for questions. When you look at the expense ratio for the year and the improvements we made, we came into the year really focused on taking cost out of two principal areas. One was acquisition related costs and the other one was operating costs, which your T&E component is a part of that but those are people related costs and operations and those types of items. And that's really what's driven the improvement, once you take the noise of restructuring and pandemic related costs out of the equation. The improvement we've seen this year has really come from those two principal areas. We've actually spent a little more on marketing, like we said we would as well, but our reductions in those two areas have really created the space for us to increase our growth related investments. As we go forward, as we've said on past calls, our focus is on continuing to drive our cost structure down because it is a core part of our growth strategy. It's how we're going to be able to continue to improve our competitive positioning in terms of auto insurance pricing and continuing to deliver really attractive returns. So that's a core part of our strategy and our focus is to continue to drive that ratio down."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Allstate's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q, and posted today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further context on a Transformative Growth Plan to accelerate growth in the personal property-liability business. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and the investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2019 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning everybody. As usual, we appreciate you joining us, investing your time to learn more about Allstate. This was just an exceptional quarter. I mean, we're adapting, we're executing, we're investing for the future. We adapted to the pandemic, the wildfires, the hurricanes, record low interest rates, and despite all of that, our execution enabled us to make $1.1 billion. At the same time, our Transformative Growth is coming to light. The stock is a great value on any measure. So we executed a $750 million ASR. Our team has performed exceptionally well this year, serving customers, creating economic value, and building a stronger foundation for growth. So let's start on Slide 2, which has Allstate's strategy, which is shown by the two ovals on the left. We're going to increase market share on Personal Property-Liability with our Transformative Growth Plan, which has three components. You remember that: expand customer access; improve customer value, which includes improving our price position and launching new products; and then investing in marketing technology. You'll hear more about that from Glenn, and then we'll - and then Mario will go through the numbers, and then we'll get to your questions. We're also expanding our protection businesses to increase - which is increasing the total addressable market we serve. We have an edge in this expansion by leveraging the Allstate brand, our customer base and our operating capabilities, which you can see in between those two ovals. For a company that empowers customers that is, you know we provide affordable simple connected products. There has been plenty to protect them from this year. As I mentioned, we get all kinds of severe weather and catastrophes and there we moved with speed and efficiency, and you can see that from our third quarter results, and those are shown on the right. Our profitability was excellent. Adjusted net income was $2.94 a share, and return on equity 17.7%. Underwriting results also remain really strong, we get favorable auto insurance results which offset the elevated home insurance losses from increased catastrophes. Implementation in Transformative Growth Plan is accelerating with the initiation of cost reduction plan in the new Allstate advertising campaign. Investment income was off slightly due to lower interest rates, but the performance-based income returned to prior year levels. We did have an annual review of our actuarial assumptions for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuity businesses which assumes that the continued low interest rate environment carries forward and reduces future investment income over the next 25 years and that resulted in several charges for the reduced net income, and Mario will go through a specific slide to show you how that works. Allstate Protection Plans has continued to grow policies, revenue and income, while expanding its total addressable market or total addressable market. So despite a tumultuous operating environment, we delivered great customer experiences, growth, excellent returns and progress on the Transformative Growth Plan. If we go to Slide 3, let's do the numbers. Total revenues of $11.5 billion increased 3.9% to the prior year quarter, and that reflects both higher net realized capital gain and growth in property-liability premiums earned. Net income of $1.1 billion increased by 26.7% to the prior year quarter, as you can see that in the table, as higher revenues more than offset Allstate Life and Annuity income in connection - which was down because in connection with those actuarial assumption. Adjusted net income of $923 million was $2.94 per share. It was $23 million lower than the prior year quarter. Its higher auto insurance underwriting income was more than offset by the elevated catastrophe losses or restructuring charges related to Transformative Growth and the lower Allstate Life and Annuities income. Our returns remained excellent, and as I said, the return on equity is well above the range that we've discussed. So let me turn it over to Glenn, who will talk about third quarter results for Personal Property-Liability.\nGlenn Shapiro: Thanks Tom. So let's go to Slide 4, and we'll discuss the - as Tom said, very strong performance of our Property-Liability business. Before going deeper into the results, it's worth mentioning that consistent with how we operate under Transformative Growth, Insurance and Allstate Financial results were combined beginning in the third quarter. Property-liability results were strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Growth was modest and lower than prior year quarter for auto insurance, but in the range that we expected as we build the foundation of Transformative Growth. And let me go into some detail on that before continuing on this slide. First, the three components of Transformative Growth were all making progress. The path is a bit steeper though at the beginning for several reasons. One, in our direct business, we lowered advertising for insurance brand since its being sunset, and that has a negative impact on new business there. At the same time, we've improved new business sales flows for online sales and improved our sales practices in our call centers for the Allstate brand being sold direct, which is significantly increasing volumes there but not yet enough to offset the insurance drop. Volume in our Allstate agents channel is on plan, except for the first two months of the pandemic, and we believe the shift in compensation towards new business that we start this year is working. We stopped hiring new agents under the existing commission contract early this year, since we're building a new lower cost agent model. We also increased base level production requirements coming into this year for agents as we're investing in agents who want to grow their business. This resulted in a planned and expected decline in licensed producers as we build the foundation on a high quality set of producers. We were in the right place with the right product at the right time when it comes to Milewise, which is our pay-per-mile product. That's really appealing to customers right now, because they are driving less during the pandemic, and we're the only major carrier offering a product like that. In the independent agent channel, Encompass had a small negative impact on growth, reflecting homeowners increases. National General acquisition which is pending will expand our access into the independent agent channel and we're really excited about the growth prospects there after closing. The cost reductions we're implementing will enable us to further improve our competitive position in auto insurance and drive growth while earning attractive returns. And on the homeowner side, premium grew 2.6% from the prior year quarter. This was due to policy growth of 1.2% and average premium increases. We're really well positioned for further growth in the homeowners business. In total, we believe that the foundation we are building to be a major player in both the direct space and independent agent space that will add to our great exclusive agent channel that we already have will lead to transformative growth. So now we'll go back to our slide and we've got a bullet or two here. Underwriting income was $753 million, increasing $16 million compared to the prior year. While the recorded combined ratio was equal to last year's third quarter, there were many meaningful changes underneath that, which are shown in the lower left chart. Starting on the left, the underlying loss ratio improved 7.8 points, primarily due to lower auto insurance losses from fewer accidents due to lower miles driven. Underlying loss ratio improvement was offset by elevated catastrophe losses in homeowners, unfavorable reserve development in discontinued lines, restructuring charges and Allstate's efforts to help customers during the pandemic, which are all shown in red. Catastrophe losses of $990 million in the third quarter were driven by a very active hurricane season and ongoing wildfires in the West Coast. This is partially offset by favorable prior year catastrophe development recognized in the quarter with $450 million and $45 million respectively coming from the PG&E and Southern California Edison subrogation settlements. Non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates were adverse $70 million in the quarter, this includes $132 million adverse from the annual review of asbestos, environmental and other reserves in the Discontinued Line and Coverage segment, which was partially offset by favorable re-estimates in the Allstate Protection personal lines. The chart on the right breaks down the expense ratio components. Excluding the impact of restructuring charge and bad debt in the third quarter, the expense ratio was 22.6, a 1.1 point improvement compared to prior-year quarter. It also represents a 2.5 point improvement if you go back to 2018. Moving to Slide 5, let's discuss our progress on Transformative Growth. And as Tom covered, Transformative Growth is a multi-year effort to accelerate growth through three components: expanding customer access, improving customer value, and investing in marketing and technology. Customer access was expanded by combining the direct sales capabilities under the Allstate brand, which enables us to leverage insurances capabilities with a stronger brand of Allstate. We're also enhancing local agent sales models to improve effectiveness and efficiency. And customer value is being improved by implementing a cost reduction program. This enables us to offer more affordable prices while maintaining strong margins. We also continue to improve the competitive price position of auto insurance with pricing sophistication. The third component is investing in marketing and technology. In the third quarter, we launched our new advertising campaign to reposition the brand supported by increased spend. Technology investments continue to improve customer facing interactions including the launch of the Allstate OneApp which simplifies all of our digital interactions in access, including telematics offerings. Moving to Slide 6, we're still deeper into a few of the actions taken in the third quarter to advance Transformative Growth. We're executing a cost reduction plan that streamlining operations and processes across claims, sales, service and support functions to lower costs. Lower costs enable us to have more affordable price without sacrificing attractive returns. The plan impacts approximately 3,800 employees this year, which will result in a charge of $290 million, with $198 million of that recognized in the third quarter and the balance in future quarters. The bulk of the charges for employee benefits incentives, including expanded transition support, extended medical coverage and deployment search assistance. The remainder is driven by real estate exit costs. At the same time, we launched a new advertising campaign in September built on the belief that we all deserve to live life well protected, as shown on the right side of the slide. The campaign repositions our brand and updates the messaging to generate business across a broader audience by showing the breadth of product portfolio we have including identity and service protection. The campaign also emphasizes a connected experience with telematics capabilities as customers' behaviors and needs are changing. I'll now turn it over to Mario to cover the rest of our results.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks Glenn. Let's go to Slide 7, which highlights investment performance for the quarter. The chart on the left shows net investment income totaled $832 million in the quarter, which was $48 million below prior year due to a decline in market-based income. Market-based income shown in blue was $68 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield which reduces income. Performance-based income totaled $210 million in the third quarter as shown in gray, partially reversing valuation declines recorded in the first half of the year. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. Year-to-date returns were 4.4% and the latest 12 months was 5.7%, reflecting higher fixed income and public equity valuations. Performance-based investment return was 2.4% for the quarter, but remained negative year-to-date. Our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon with higher but more volatile return expectations compared to the market-based portfolio. The compound annual rate of return on the performance based portfolio is 7.2% over the past five years as is shown on the bottom right of the table, exceeding the market-based return by 220 basis points. Let's move to Slide 8 and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate's annual review of assumptions and the expectation of lower long-term interest rates unfavorably impacted the Allstate Life, benefits and Annuities segments in the third quarter. Allstate Life shown on the left recorded an adjusted net loss of $14 million in the third quarter. The loss was due to accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs, primarily from lower projected future interest rates related to the annual review of assumptions. Higher contract benefits also reduced adjusted net income, including $22 million in coronavirus death claims. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $33 million in the third quarter was $2 million higher than the prior year quarter, driven by a decrease in contract benefits, primarily due to lower claim experience. This decrease was driven by limited activities and the deferral of non-essential medical procedures as a result of the pandemic. The benefit from lower reported claim experience was partially offset by the acceleration of deferred acquisition cost amortization related to the annual review of assumptions. Allstate Annuities had adjusted net income of $37 million in the third quarter as contract benefits decreased primarily from favorable mortality experience compared to the prior year quarter. In the third quarter, Allstate Annuities also recorded a premium deficiency reserve of $225 million, pre-tax, given the expectation that interest rates will remain low over the long duration of these liabilities and annuitants are living longer than originally anticipated. While this reduced net income for the quarter, it did not impact adjusted net income. And let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the Allstate Annuities and the premium deficiency reserve in a little more detail. As you can see on the chart, we've been reducing our Annuity business consistently over the last 15 years to manage risk-adjusted returns. As a result of this dynamic, we began to systematically exit these businesses. In 2006, we reinsured the variable annuity business. In 2010, we exited the broker dealer channel. In 2013, we stopped issuing structured settlements. And in 2014, we stopped issuing all remaining annuity products and sold Lincoln Benefit Life. As a result, liabilities declined from $75 billion in 2005 to $17.5 billion as of the end of the third quarter. Today, liabilities are made up of that $17.5 billion dollars of reserves and contract holder funds related to deferred and immediate annuities. Our asset liability management strategy has positioned the portfolio to cash match near term liabilities while investing in public equities and performance-based assets for longer duration liabilities to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Two-thirds of the payments on these annuities are expected to be made after 2030. As part of our third quarter review of actuarial assumptions we lowered our long-term return assumptions given the expectation that interest rates will remain low for an extended period. This reduces expected future investment income. Mortality assumptions were also updated to reflect the expectation that annuitant will live longer. These two changes led to a forecast where current reserves and expected returns on those reserves over the life of these annuities is less than the expected payouts, which led to the charge of $225 million pretax. So now let's go to Slide 10 and discuss the results of our service businesses. The service businesses continue to generate strong growth as policies in force increased 38.6% to $133 million in the third quarter, driven by Allstate Protection plans growth. Revenue, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses grew 16.9% to $484 million in the third quarter. Adjusted net income of $40 million reflects an increase of $32 million compared to the third quarter of 2019. The improvement continues to be driven by the growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate roadside services. Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review the results of Allstate Protection plans in a bit more detail. So, as you remember, the acquisition in early 2017 for $1.4 billion further expanded our circle of protection for customers and continues to exceed growth and profit expectations. As you can see in the chart on the left, Allstate Protection Plan has had exceptional growth since acquisition in early 2017. Policies in force increased more than fourfold from less than 30 million policies in 2017 to 126 million in the third quarter of 2020. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 51%. In addition, net written premium of $831 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased 50% compared to the prior year period. On the right you can see that Allstate Protection plans began generating positive adjusted net income in early 2018, which is earlier than expected. The upward trajectory has continued this year, generating $105 million of adjusted net income through the first nine months of 2020. Even more important to shareholder value is the trajectory going forward from here. The team has successfully expanded the total addressable market into appliances, furniture, cellular carriers and international markets with revenues in each of these areas. The combination of attractive unit economics, scalable technology platform and the power of The Allstate brand will lead to continued profitable growth in this business. Quite simply, this is not your typical protection platform. Finally on Slide 12, we want to highlight Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate generated strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 17.7% as of the end of the third quarter. We returned $967 million to common shareholders in the third quarter. Through a combination of $798 million in share repurchases and $169 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year, we have reduced common shares outstanding by 6.4% primarily as a result of our share repurchase program. As you can see from the table. Book value per share of $82.39 increased 18% compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting income generation and increased fixed income valuations, partially offset by cash returned to shareholders. Allstate stock valuation metrics, however, have not kept pace with this combined strength and strong operating performance. With that context we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nYaron Kinar: First question is with regards to top line growth. So I understand there are a lot of moving parts here and you're selling early to maybe the end of the beginning of the transformative growth plan. At what point do you think we actually do start seeing the initiative and the various components there resulted in top line growth?\nTom Wilson: Yaron, this is Tom. So they - we can't really give you a quarter and say here's one that turn a say you should buy the stock right before that. So that what is really reflecting the terrible pop because a number of things happening. Right? So we're trying to make sure we take care of our existing customers well, and that requires, as we change out some of the agents and the stuff Glenn talked about, we have to make sure we're doing that well with integrated service and moving people to other agencies. Second, there is obviously a competitive market in which we're in. So part of it depends what happens with our competitors and what they do, how much more they put into advertising, how much they raise homeowners prices. I think that what I would say is the focus seems to be narrowed down to just auto insurance and really transformative growth is about auto insurance is about home insurance where we're getting a growth - good growth and not as much as we think we can have, but certainly higher than auto and then the circle of protection. So I can't really call it by quarter. I would say is, you should expect as you see the components come into place. You should expect to see a trajectory up from here. But we're not giving specific guidance on here. Here's where more going to be at X percent of market share gains.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then my second question, somewhat related these launch of the Allstate One app. Are there any metrics you can share with us around, have the company applications have been downloaded, take-up rate in the ease of use or how long it takes to get a quote on the app?\nTom Wilson: Well we have - average that we have a whole bunch of metrics and we don't give most of them out, because we think we're starting to get in advantage versus our competitors on it and we really don't want them copying what we are doing that in both sub year on to your point, both on things like also in telematics. So we're really positive about what we got going on there. And, but we - I would tell you that the insurance industry in general is not to the level that banks are which says we have a lot of potential to increase our connectivity and lower cost at the same time. Glenn, anything you would add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: No, I think that covers it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please.\nGreg Peters: So I'm going to stick with the transformative growth plan. And I think in your second bullet point, you talked about improving customer value. So there's two pieces of that as we sit outside looking in, one is the expense ratio initiatives that you've highlighted. The other one would be just price to your customers. So can you give us an idea of where the expense ratio will go to or what sort of objective you have in the context of your competition? And then, on price, we have observed a number of your competitors starting to cut prices in the marketplace and in auto insurance and I'm curious about your posture with respect to that.\nTom Wilson: Greg, let me start with the overview on transformer growth and then Glenn, if you could jump into where we are on pricing these. So transformer growth has three components, right. Second one is improved customer value, that is really two components to it. But one is improve the competitive price position and with affordable products. And second is to launch new products, the things like [indiscernible]. So the second piece is really about more differentiation price the cost piece is really the way a door you go through to get to the price piece. So they are not separate. So in the reason we haven't put cost targets out there, we obviously have cost target and we also have price competitive targets. The reason we haven't put those out there is, they are tightly linked. And we don't want to signal to our competitors, where we think we're going our price. So it's not that we don't have targets we do, and we think we can reduce our costs, which enables us to give customers better value called more affordable price without sacrificing attractive margins. So that's the path we're on. Reduce expenses, if those expense is down turn that into a more affordable price, which increases your closed rate, which then drives growth. So the first - it's really one component that you're talking about. The second piece will take some time, because you have to rebuild the whole technology stack, there's just a bunch of work that has to be done to launch new products. That will take a couple of years to really get done, which is why we keep this is a multi-year initiative. Glenn, do you want to give Greg an update on pricing and your thoughts there?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes, you've covered, Tom. Well, the - going forward, how we bring the cost down and keep margins while being a better value for customers. But I don't want to leave anybody the impression that we're not moving now because sometimes you can look at a like an investor supplement and say, well, it was zero rate taken and think that that means there is zero rate action. We have made hundreds of filings over the last quarter, all across the country and I know you always hear me say it Greg, but we manage this at the market level. So we've got a really talented group of state managers, I always talk about that. They've got their hands on the lever they\u2019re looking at, how competitive are we each competitor in this market, what's our close rate doing, what type of shifts are we seeing in customers and quoting and they're moving those levers all the time and we're working with regulators to do that. So the hundreds of filings that we've made already since the pandemic and through this time have materially changed our competitive position in spite of that 0.0, you see on total rate filing. We've done things like improved our competitive position on telematic products, increased new business discounts, changed pricing around for the type of people that are shopping. And so the average person that's out there shopping for insurance is getting a lower price rate now for us than they were six months ago or nine months ago meaningfully lower. And so this is how we stay competitive, and it goes a little bit back to Yaron's comment or question on growth, and I look at it as while we're building this foundation, like I mean we're setting up the capability for us to be a major player in direct. We are setting up the capability for us to be a major player in independent agent with the acquisition that's pending. And while we're building that foundation, I'd call it, we're holding our own. Like we actually grew policies year-over-year, policies in force, minimally in auto more so in home, but we're doing a good job of keeping the fight going and keeping our growth engine going in spite of building that foundation.\nGreg Peters: Your answers makes sense. I guess the second question, and it's just going to pivot to the other source of income would be investment income and just looking over the Slide 7 and considering Mario's comments, there is obviously two pieces and it's been volatile this year. But it feels like because of the current interest rate environment there is going to be downward pressure on your market-based returns and therefore investment earnings you generate off that for the next year or two. And then also on the performance base, the volatility is interesting for us to try and model. So can you frame it for us as we think about what the future performance might be of the performance-based portfolio?\nTom Wilson: Greg, let me go up and then, John you can talk about the risk adjusted return of volatility of the performance base. So - as - when we do our investment allocations all the way at the top, we look at risk adjusted return based on economic capital per asset class and so earlier this year when we sold $4 billion of our $6 billion of public equities, it was because we saw the pandemic come in or we thought there is going to be a dip down and then a bump back up, it was - and we are going to avoid that volatility. We just - we didn't think the risk adjusted return was right. When we look at our market-based results and you're right. Interest rates are coming down there at low rates, really low rates, you're probably not going to have as much capital on those bonds as you had historically. And we looked at the risk adjusted return on the performance space, we decided it was a better risk adjusted return on the performance is now. Obviously, it comes with more volatility and particularly from quarter to quarter, as you point out, so what we did is we matched those performance space, the long-term viability is on dated annuities or capital, which we expect to have for a long time and so when you do that you can handle that in term volatility because - and that's why you get the higher risk adjusted return because you're taking on that volatility. And once you get past seven years, - you're better off owning equities and bonds, as you all know well from just looking at the pension funds. And you get past 10 years and it's like you get double the return and you actually have less risk on equity. So that's how we got to performance-based equities and we're willing to accept that volatility either because we have liabilities or capital which we know will have and will recoup the incremental economic return over time. Before I turn to John let me just - one other thing, as you look forward, what we do of course, is when we're managing our auto business in particular, we look at what underwriting margin do we need given what we think we're going to get in investment income. So to the extent investment income, it goes down, we given our power in underwriting, we're able to still make a good return for our shareholders even with slightly lower interest rates. Unlike some of the life companies who have no other way to adjust their future premiums. So John, do you want to spend a few minutes talking about performance space?\nJohn Dugenske: Yes sure, Tom. And Greg, thanks for the question. I'll pick up where Tom left off. When you think about performance base it can be volatile for periods of time. As Tom mentioned, we really match it off versus longer liabilities that we have. If you take a longer-term view and this is information that's in the supplement, - over a 10-year period, the internal rate of return, which is a common way of measuring these assets is about 11.5% and when you look at it over 10 years or over five years relative to the public equity benchmarks that we think about owning these assets against, they are superior in terms of return. So we're willing to take some of that volatility relative to more observable public markets because we think we've got a team that has skill and expertise that can extract value out of the marketplace that it isn't easy for other people to do. I tend to think of it is we've got a lot of flash lights that we can shine in different corners of the market that maybe everyone else doesn't have to extract additional value. Now you're right to point out there has been a little bit bumpier during the course of this year and that does require some explanation. Yes, I think we'd all agree this year, it has been a pretty unique year and when you think about what releases income in performance-based assets, part of that is the deal flow itself, you need to - we invest in a particular entity, whether it's a fund or an individual investment, it improves in value over time. And then we tend to sell those investments and it generates income. During the period of time when deal flow was down because people just travel to do due-diligence and that sort of thing it's normal to understand that that income was reduced. There was also and we disclosed this earlier in the year, we did have some loss, we had about $130 million in actual losses in that place in as well. What we've seen this quarter is a beginning of returning to more normalized deal activity. So we're not going to predict the future here, but there is reason if you look back, relative to what we've experienced historically, we're starting to see a pattern that starts to fit in a little bit. So long dated liabilities matches up well versus that. We like the long run returns even though they're more volatile, but we think there is a period of what we can do in public markets. When it comes to rates you've seen us Greg, you've seen us be proactive in the way that we think about investing in our market-based portfolio. And as Tom said, that's part of a larger enterprise system where we think about risk and return across the enterprise, whether it's underwriting risk, mortality risk or investment risk and return, and we've made changes over time to address for different market environments. So a good example of that is coming out of the global financial crisis. We reduced interest rate risk as rates became lower and we took more credit risk. We thought that it was, that had a good risk return profile. As rates started to increase in recent years, we've lengthened our duration to take advantage of that and that's served us quite well as interest rates have fallen here. And we've subsequently in beginning of the year we saw less value on a risk adjusted basis for public equities and reduce that. One thing that may not be completely obvious is during the course of the year, this year we've taken further actions - we're not only are we helping buffer income by increasing duration, but we've also moved some of that equity exposure and some of our pure government exposure into almost $10 billion of investment grade credit some high quality, high yield and associated securities to help minimize the impact that lower rates we will have. I mean you're right, if rates stay this slow for a long period of time there will be a reduction of income, it's just kind of pure math that play out that way. When I look at the Slide 7 of the presentation and you see those blue lines. It just doesn't happen that rapidly part of our investments are matched off versus longer liabilities. So they're cash matched and then part of it has to happen as the portfolio tends to roll off over periods of time. So, it will happen if rates remain low for a long period of time, it won't happen overnight. And we're hopeful like most people are that interest rates will recover some ground as we pull out of the COVID-induced lower interest rate paradigm that we're currently in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.\nMike Zaremski: First question, looking through the deck I see one of statements saying improved online and call center sales flow in Allstate direct. Can you give us a flavor for how much of your sales today I think mostly think of Allstate as a agency-based seller of insurance, but how much is coming from direct? And related, I believe in the past you've said that as part of the transformation program, you might be offering a discount to existing customers to potentially use more of the direct platform versus the agents, is that still part of the game plan?\nTom Wilson: Mike, let me first start with the overview and [indiscernible] and Glenn, if you want to talk about sort of sales flows and what you've got going on in sales. And so, we've put together the usage, so if you looked at our old stuff last quarter you would see Esurance broken out and that was 100% direct, either online or through call centers. We did also sell some business under the Allstate brand in the same manner, mostly through call centers, but a little bit online. And with the new format we have, we put those two together. And so, we're not planning on breaking out how much comes out direct and how much comes through agents. You're correct in that if you buy direct, today you get, what you paid for, so you don't pay for an agent. So you don't - the price is 7% lower if you buy direct from the company, but that's for only for new customers. We're not going back to existing customers and saying hey, how would you like the 7% price reduction because they are happy with their existing relationships. They bought from those agents, they have as we cross-sell into those agents. So there is no really need to go disrupt that were about giving it to people anyway they want. If you want an agent you can call us and get an agent and - you call center we\u2019ll get you an agent, and you can have a local agent. If you want to do self-serve, and you want to do it online, we'll do that as well. So the strategy is to really leverage the Allstate brand and take that Esurance money which was spent - Esurance advertising money which was hundreds of millions of dollars a year and throw that at the Allstate brand. So, that, we could compete more aggressively with GEICO and Progressive in the direct space. Glenn, do you want to talk about like sales flows and how you're making that work so?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes, so the team that we've had that ran Esurance and has been put together as Allstate as Tom said, with the Allstate Group. And you would think that it would be relatively easy to flip a switch and say, hey, we're a direct company now and accordingly play big in this space. But we literally have decades of connective tissue and process built around everything is an off-ramp for an agency system. And so what we want to be and aspire to be in the near term, is a company that really goes to market in both ways. It's open access for a customer, customer that wants to click our call that we do that really effectively and we can compete with the biggest direct carriers out there. In that space and think about that as a full channel. And then it takes nothing away from the exclusive agent channel we have which is outstanding. They do an incredible job for customers. They've done a great job through the pandemic you can see it in our retention numbers and continue to grow that channel. But the work they've done is really the pick and shovel work of removing some of those pieces of connective tissue between channels and really going to market as a direct business. Esurance was set up that way because it was a separate run operation. This now is common product, its common back end service that we have, but it's a separate sales channel.\nMike Zaremski: Last question, circling back to the annuity business and we do appreciate all the color. I think we all get asked a lot whether Allstate would entertain a transaction. So I know you've answered that in the past, but maybe I'll try to ask in a different way. So you've pointed out very well that you've moved a lot of the investments into kind of longer duration hopefully higher yielding assets, which is one of the things that some of the private equity backed firms do as part of their right their special sauce? So would you say that lower interest rate environment combined with how you guys positioned the portfolio kind of makes the bid-ask spread of entering a transaction wider than it was a year or so ago?\nTom Wilson: First Mike, if you look at the one slide that we've taken annuities down some $75 billion to $17 billion over a period of time. And we've done that with a couple of objectives in mind, what we want to make sure we take care of customers do you want to get a good deal for shareholders. And so we've been kind of whittling away at it and these are the last two chunks we have left. And we're open to different ways to do that and if we look at all different ways to do it all the time so everything from reinsurance to sales, everything else. And so, I don't think lower interest - rates obviously are something you need to factor in. It's less important when you have the investment portfolio that you just mentioned in terms of what it does to the - it helps fill the gap from low interest rates because you're earning higher returns. I think we have decided so this - these are becoming more scarce properties because you've seen the asset managers go out and they like having what I would call captive asset. So there is a whole host of you are all familiar with that throughout and want to buy annuity blocks. So that they can have those assets to manage and then they separately finance the purchase of a company part with their money and part with other people's money it's a way to build a better revenue stream for themselves. We're open to that thing as long as it meets our two objectives. One, you got to take care of our customers. So some of these customers are going to get paid for 30-plus years we don't want to turn that somebody that's going to take it all and go to Las Vegas and put it on red. And then our customers are left hole in the bag. Secondly, we want to make sure it's good deal for our shareholders. So, we're always looking at opportunities to further reduce the exposure. I mean, you look at that trend line. We have a slide that is and it's - there is no reason to expect that we would try to change that trend line. It will go down by itself. So, like they do roll off people to stop collecting payments either because their term is up or they pass away. So, but you should expect it keep going down if we can find the right way to do that for shareholders and customers then we\u2019ll do it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nPhil Stefano: So with the sun setting of the Esurance brand we\u2019re down to three brands now. I guess in my mind, part of the transformative growth plan is a rally behind the Allstate brand so strategically you could talk about the importance of Encompass and answer financial. As we think about the transformative growth plan over time?\nTom Wilson: So it's Tom. I think it's really one brand. And we have some names, but right now we have one what I would call consumer brand. There is obviously some brands amongst agents. And so, you see us leveraging a brand, not just on direct, but Allstate Protection products. I don't believe we would have gotten Walmart and driven the kind of growth we have without the Allstate team on there and the Allstate backing. Same is true with Home Depot, which will be rolling out starting in January. So it's really one brand. There are - you do point out two other ways if you go to market. So Glenn, could you talk about plans or the independent agent channel Encompass with National General and then just touch on what you're doing with Answer Financial as well?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes so in the IA space, it really is National General and I won't get into the brand, because I don't know if any decisions made in terms of exactly the brand. But as Tom said, it's more of a branding with agents than it is with customers in that channel. But with National General and Encompass it's really about bringing those together in sort of a reverse integration because National General has a platform, a technology platform that the IAs love. They have 42,000 existing relationships with agency locations to go along with the 10,000 that we have with Allstate and Encompass. And between the two companies, we have a product set that goes from non-standard all the way up through high net worth and everything in between. And what I always point out on this is, I think maybe the most important part is our homeowners\u2019 capability. The IA space they really need that the full stack and all the capabilities and we clearly have a premier homeowners capability at Allstate. So you put all of that together and we will have the most capabilities of any carrier we will be the Number 5 in size, as soon as the closing goes through in the IA space. But we will be number one in terms of overall top to bottom capabilities. That won't be the day that we go live it won't be that because we won\u2019t been able to integrate products and everything and push it across. But in short order we will be able to bring those together and really go to that market and be a very major player in the independent agent space. And that, pertaining there was second part to that.\nPhil Stefano: Answer Financial?\nGlenn Shapiro: No, I'm sorry Answer Financial, thanks. Yes, so on Answer Financial, that is - it's a very different type of model. That really is taking care of customers who we can't take care of in other ways. Are they sort of fall between the cracks of - always narrowing cracks actually at this point because we cover just about all different types of customers at this point. But the narrowing cracks there and it's a way to monetize the exhaust from our expense on marketing and make sure that anybody that comes to us - we can get to at some point. And so Answer Financial from a branding standpoint is separate and they sell multiple carriers.\nPhil Stefano: I think going back to the National General acquisition we noticed in the Q, that there was a note that you're currently contemplating the mix of cash and debt for that purchase. I was hoping you might be able to further find your point on what your thoughts are there. And just intertwine that into a - broader thoughts on capital management and share repurchases?\nTom Wilson: Mario you could take that.\nMario Rizzo: Sure, Phil. Thanks for the question. Yes - when we announced the National General acquisition, the financing strategy all along was part cash from our deployable capital part excess capital within the National General structure and part debt so that continues to be the strategy in terms of how we'll fund National General. So that part hasn't changed. So we fully expect it to execute across all three dimensions and the closed process is progressing on that acquisition. In terms of broader capital management - and I think Tom mentioned this early on. We continue to think the stock is undervalued. And we have ample capital and liquidity available to continue to buy back stock. We got - excuse me $2.8 billion holding company assets. We got over almost $7 billion of readily available liquidity. Our debt-to-cap ratios are below 20%. So we feel really good about the financial strength of the organization and that's one of the reasons. That combined with our view on the relative valuation of the stock is what led us to do the $750 million ASR in the fourth quarter. We got 7 million shares as part of that. We still have ways to go on the current share repurchase authorization. So we still have just under $1.6 billion left and we'll continue to execute on that. And the point that's worth mentioning is, as we've said from the beginning, the National General acquisition doesn't impact the buyback program. We fully expect to complete that by the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nJoshua Shanker: On your press release you were announcing the restructuring plan you made the comment that the cost reductions and job reductions were necessary in order to maintain underwriting ratios. I'm not really asking for guidance, but obviously COVID throws a little bit of curve on things? When we think about 2019, I guess is there actually a possibility in your long-term outlook that you think the type of underwriting margins you are achieving on a COVID-normalized basis can be maintained into the years going out given price reactions and given what your goals are?\nTom Wilson: [technical difficulty] Josh, because I'm not sure what COVID-normalized are. But I think. I think the shortest way to answer that is we are in really attractive returns on auto insurance. We have for 14-15 years, maybe longer are running and we have a system and an objective and goals that we've achieved to continue that. When I say COVID-normalized, what we don't really know is certainly of course when the pandemic ends which is beyond your normalization. But I'm not sure what it will do to consumer behavior, particularly driving, I think computing is going to be viewed as overrated. And so, given that about a third of the time people are in their cars they're driving to and from work. So if even a small portion of people so 25% of the people commute less. That's a pretty big drop, and we will react to that when we can. I think what it does, it gives us more room to maintain the kind of returns we have while getting more competitive. And so, but you should assume we\u2019ll continue to be focused on earning attractive returns. That comment in the press release was really about saying, we didn't have to reduce cost, because we're not making money. There are a lot of people out there who today are airlines and other people were having let people go because they just in trouble. We're not in trouble. We're making really good money. And so we don't need to do it they are reason. We also as we're talking about getting more competitive in auto insurance in particular. We don't want everybody. Moving to the conclusion, which you could, if you took your question farther would be that we're going to do that by given in a way - like say anybody can give it away its talented teams that both grow and make money. And so, we were just trying to point out that the point that and Greg mentioned earlier, which is that the cost and the pricing are tightly linked. And I know a lot of you would like to have some expense ratio target that you could put into your models but trust us, we have a measure. It's a good measure, it's aggressive, but it's tied to what we're trying to do on price. So we're not willing to talk about that publicly.\nJoshua Shanker: And just a quick one on square trading growth. Obviously people are stuck at their homes, they've been buying a lot of stuff on Amazon and whatnot. Do you think that 2020 was a record year for consumer electronics purchasing and that 2021 will face some headwinds in beating 2020 as a year for new policy yet square trading or Allstate protection plans?\nTom Wilson: Let me ask Don answer that and then just do a commercial before that, which is - we are stronger being together with SquareTrade than we were independently both in terms of what it does for a server protection and what we do for them in getting Walmart Home Depot leveraging the Allstate brand. But I would say you put this up against any of the recent IPOs out there. This thing is worth a whole lot more than we paid for. Don, do you want to talk about what happened?\nDon Civgin: Sure. So, Josh, first, the trends have been strong for a long time. So it's not like this year, all of a sudden SquareTrade took off, they've been doing well since the acquisition. It's been a combination of things that's driven that. It's the growth in the existing customers by which they've been able to help drive with their customers. It's been additional customers that they've added B2B customers additional retailers and then this thing that Mario talked about which is just extending their total addressable market. So three years ago there were largely consumer electronics to U.S. retail. But since then it's the more than consumer electronics, it's now appliances. It's now furniture, it's now international business that's growing dramatically. It's cell carriers and so forth. So it's been kind of expansion across the board, which has been consistent for the last three years. This year's results, you're right, we're impacted by COVID, they were going to be strong regardless. So this was going to be a really great year. We got the benefit of COVID but it wasn't just people buying online, it was the customers that we have the places, people are shopping in the categories that lend themselves to warranties are the ones that customers have been purchasing. So whether it's setting up our own office or setting up consumer electronics as you said. So this year has been good and it's been positively impacted, but I think it would be a big mistake to assume it wouldn't have been good anyway. And then when you get into 2021 and those underlying trends that I talked about that have been going for three years will continue. And so, we still expect them to continue to grow and do well. I suspect at some point the lack of buying power in the economy will probably dampen retail sales across the board, more hard to predict how that's going to happen when that's going to happen. But I think that's the - that's on the margin, the underlying trends will continue in a very strong manner.\nJoshua Shanker: Thank you very much.\nTom Wilson: Add to that is, when you look forward in 2021 in Allstate Protection plans, the mix of policies going to change some. So you'll see the policy growth come, but you will see the revenues continue to accelerate as particularly as we get into bigger dollar amount per policy. So just one thing to get a warranty policy on a iPad, it's another thing for a washer or dryer or for furniture. So you should still see and we expect increased revenue growth, but you may see a slight take off of drop maintaining 51% company growth and policies gets hard as you move into bigger dollar policies. Now I'll take one more question and then we'll wrap up.\nOperator: Our final question then for the day comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper. Your question please.\nPaul Newsome: I guess I was hoping you could just revisit a little bit, you've already made some comments about driving behavior that's pandemic related and what you're seeing is changing, nothing terribly specific, but you had some peers are talking about these changes in driving for example, to work or not versus regular driving. As well, I was curious if you've seen differences that were material on a state basis. Again nothing specific to state, but if there is early insights into kind of what's happening from a dynamic - from an natural behavioral perspective, I think that would be very interesting.\nTom Wilson: Glenn, why don't you answer that. I would say, Paul, the other part is with [Aire] tracking 26 million cars, we have 10 times the amount of miles driven that a company that recently went public. And so we got lots of good math on this. So, Glenn, can share with you what he is saying, just in terms of miles driven and what the impact is on frequency.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. And thanks for the question, Paul, it is interesting getting into the data in this space. And as Tom said, with billions of miles of data we've got and the partnership with [Aire] we're able to really get into the detail. The short answer to your question is yes. There are absolutely differences state by state. There are broad trends that are true everywhere when you see some of the things about commuting and total miles driven, but you will see based on sort of where states are in the pandemic where they have either formal stay at home orders or shutdowns or anything versus when they have more informal they just have a lot of cases coming in, and just attitude differ by state in terms of how to deal with either staying home or not and so on. So we do see differences by state, but there is enough of a prevailing sort of tailwind on it that there is more similarities than difference. A couple of things, just to go deeper on the comments Tom made before, we see about 40% of our losses happen in rush hour. And so, as we're working through and we predict, again, this gets to different states because obviously in metro areas it's more of a true some of that rush hour than the non-metro areas. But we get a double effect in terms of the frequency of those accidents in rush hour in one fewer people so fewer of our drivers that we insure are actually traveling during rush hour. And so, if you're not traveling, you're not having an accident. And two, the ones who still are, because it's not zero are on less congested roads, so they have fewer accidents, and you see that in the types of accidents that remain. So it is not a pure mix of - if there were a million accidents before and you take out 10% of them. It is not a random 10%. It is a very specific 10%. And so with the mix of what's left is very different and all of these are things that we are looking at in a granular level down to state detail. So that, as I mentioned before, those the pricing actions we take, the go-to-market actions we take are highly specific.\nTom Wilson: So thank you all for participating. We had an excellent quarter. Mark is obviously available for any follow-up questions the things we didn't get to, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Dugenske",
            "content": "Yes sure, Tom. And Greg, thanks for the question. I'll pick up where Tom left off. When you think about performance base it can be volatile for periods of time. As Tom mentioned, we really match it off versus longer liabilities that we have. If you take a longer-term view and this is information that's in the supplement, - over a 10-year period, the internal rate of return, which is a common way of measuring these assets is about 11.5% and when you look at it over 10 years or over five years relative to the public equity benchmarks that we think about owning these assets against, they are superior in terms of return. So we're willing to take some of that volatility relative to more observable public markets because we think we've got a team that has skill and expertise that can extract value out of the marketplace that it isn't easy for other people to do. I tend to think of it is we've got a lot of flash lights that we can shine in different corners of the market that maybe everyone else doesn't have to extract additional value. Now you're right to point out there has been a little bit bumpier during the course of this year and that does require some explanation. Yes, I think we'd all agree this year, it has been a pretty unique year and when you think about what releases income in performance-based assets, part of that is the deal flow itself, you need to - we invest in a particular entity, whether it's a fund or an individual investment, it improves in value over time. And then we tend to sell those investments and it generates income. During the period of time when deal flow was down because people just travel to do due-diligence and that sort of thing it's normal to understand that that income was reduced. There was also and we disclosed this earlier in the year, we did have some loss, we had about $130 million in actual losses in that place in as well. What we've seen this quarter is a beginning of returning to more normalized deal activity. So we're not going to predict the future here, but there is reason if you look back, relative to what we've experienced historically, we're starting to see a pattern that starts to fit in a little bit. So long dated liabilities matches up well versus that. We like the long run returns even though they're more volatile, but we think there is a period of what we can do in public markets. When it comes to rates you've seen us Greg, you've seen us be proactive in the way that we think about investing in our market-based portfolio. And as Tom said, that's part of a larger enterprise system where we think about risk and return across the enterprise, whether it's underwriting risk, mortality risk or investment risk and return, and we've made changes over time to address for different market environments. So a good example of that is coming out of the global financial crisis. We reduced interest rate risk as rates became lower and we took more credit risk. We thought that it was, that had a good risk return profile. As rates started to increase in recent years, we've lengthened our duration to take advantage of that and that's served us quite well as interest rates have fallen here. And we've subsequently in beginning of the year we saw less value on a risk adjusted basis for public equities and reduce that. One thing that may not be completely obvious is during the course of the year, this year we've taken further actions - we're not only are we helping buffer income by increasing duration, but we've also moved some of that equity exposure and some of our pure government exposure into almost $10 billion of investment grade credit some high quality, high yield and associated securities to help minimize the impact that lower rates we will have. I mean you're right, if rates stay this slow for a long period of time there will be a reduction of income, it's just kind of pure math that play out that way. When I look at the Slide 7 of the presentation and you see those blue lines. It just doesn't happen that rapidly part of our investments are matched off versus longer liabilities. So they're cash matched and then part of it has to happen as the portfolio tends to roll off over periods of time. So, it will happen if rates remain low for a long period of time, it won't happen overnight. And we're hopeful like most people are that interest rates will recover some ground as we pull out of the COVID-induced lower interest rate paradigm that we're currently in."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks Glenn. Let's go to Slide 7, which highlights investment performance for the quarter. The chart on the left shows net investment income totaled $832 million in the quarter, which was $48 million below prior year due to a decline in market-based income. Market-based income shown in blue was $68 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield which reduces income. Performance-based income totaled $210 million in the third quarter as shown in gray, partially reversing valuation declines recorded in the first half of the year. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. Year-to-date returns were 4.4% and the latest 12 months was 5.7%, reflecting higher fixed income and public equity valuations. Performance-based investment return was 2.4% for the quarter, but remained negative year-to-date. Our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon with higher but more volatile return expectations compared to the market-based portfolio. The compound annual rate of return on the performance based portfolio is 7.2% over the past five years as is shown on the bottom right of the table, exceeding the market-based return by 220 basis points. Let's move to Slide 8 and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate's annual review of assumptions and the expectation of lower long-term interest rates unfavorably impacted the Allstate Life, benefits and Annuities segments in the third quarter. Allstate Life shown on the left recorded an adjusted net loss of $14 million in the third quarter. The loss was due to accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs, primarily from lower projected future interest rates related to the annual review of assumptions. Higher contract benefits also reduced adjusted net income, including $22 million in coronavirus death claims. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $33 million in the third quarter was $2 million higher than the prior year quarter, driven by a decrease in contract benefits, primarily due to lower claim experience. This decrease was driven by limited activities and the deferral of non-essential medical procedures as a result of the pandemic. The benefit from lower reported claim experience was partially offset by the acceleration of deferred acquisition cost amortization related to the annual review of assumptions. Allstate Annuities had adjusted net income of $37 million in the third quarter as contract benefits decreased primarily from favorable mortality experience compared to the prior year quarter. In the third quarter, Allstate Annuities also recorded a premium deficiency reserve of $225 million, pre-tax, given the expectation that interest rates will remain low over the long duration of these liabilities and annuitants are living longer than originally anticipated. While this reduced net income for the quarter, it did not impact adjusted net income. And let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the Allstate Annuities and the premium deficiency reserve in a little more detail. As you can see on the chart, we've been reducing our Annuity business consistently over the last 15 years to manage risk-adjusted returns. As a result of this dynamic, we began to systematically exit these businesses. In 2006, we reinsured the variable annuity business. In 2010, we exited the broker dealer channel. In 2013, we stopped issuing structured settlements. And in 2014, we stopped issuing all remaining annuity products and sold Lincoln Benefit Life. As a result, liabilities declined from $75 billion in 2005 to $17.5 billion as of the end of the third quarter. Today, liabilities are made up of that $17.5 billion dollars of reserves and contract holder funds related to deferred and immediate annuities. Our asset liability management strategy has positioned the portfolio to cash match near term liabilities while investing in public equities and performance-based assets for longer duration liabilities to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Two-thirds of the payments on these annuities are expected to be made after 2030. As part of our third quarter review of actuarial assumptions we lowered our long-term return assumptions given the expectation that interest rates will remain low for an extended period. This reduces expected future investment income. Mortality assumptions were also updated to reflect the expectation that annuitant will live longer. These two changes led to a forecast where current reserves and expected returns on those reserves over the life of these annuities is less than the expected payouts, which led to the charge of $225 million pretax. So now let's go to Slide 10 and discuss the results of our service businesses. The service businesses continue to generate strong growth as policies in force increased 38.6% to $133 million in the third quarter, driven by Allstate Protection plans growth. Revenue, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses grew 16.9% to $484 million in the third quarter. Adjusted net income of $40 million reflects an increase of $32 million compared to the third quarter of 2019. The improvement continues to be driven by the growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate roadside services. Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review the results of Allstate Protection plans in a bit more detail. So, as you remember, the acquisition in early 2017 for $1.4 billion further expanded our circle of protection for customers and continues to exceed growth and profit expectations. As you can see in the chart on the left, Allstate Protection Plan has had exceptional growth since acquisition in early 2017. Policies in force increased more than fourfold from less than 30 million policies in 2017 to 126 million in the third quarter of 2020. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 51%. In addition, net written premium of $831 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased 50% compared to the prior year period. On the right you can see that Allstate Protection plans began generating positive adjusted net income in early 2018, which is earlier than expected. The upward trajectory has continued this year, generating $105 million of adjusted net income through the first nine months of 2020. Even more important to shareholder value is the trajectory going forward from here. The team has successfully expanded the total addressable market into appliances, furniture, cellular carriers and international markets with revenues in each of these areas. The combination of attractive unit economics, scalable technology platform and the power of The Allstate brand will lead to continued profitable growth in this business. Quite simply, this is not your typical protection platform. Finally on Slide 12, we want to highlight Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate generated strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 17.7% as of the end of the third quarter. We returned $967 million to common shareholders in the third quarter. Through a combination of $798 million in share repurchases and $169 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year, we have reduced common shares outstanding by 6.4% primarily as a result of our share repurchase program. As you can see from the table. Book value per share of $82.39 increased 18% compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting income generation and increased fixed income valuations, partially offset by cash returned to shareholders. Allstate stock valuation metrics, however, have not kept pace with this combined strength and strong operating performance. With that context we will open up the line for questions. Sure, Phil. Thanks for the question. Yes - when we announced the National General acquisition, the financing strategy all along was part cash from our deployable capital part excess capital within the National General structure and part debt so that continues to be the strategy in terms of how we'll fund National General. So that part hasn't changed. So we fully expect it to execute across all three dimensions and the closed process is progressing on that acquisition. In terms of broader capital management - and I think Tom mentioned this early on. We continue to think the stock is undervalued. And we have ample capital and liquidity available to continue to buy back stock. We got - excuse me $2.8 billion holding company assets. We got over almost $7 billion of readily available liquidity. Our debt-to-cap ratios are below 20%. So we feel really good about the financial strength of the organization and that's one of the reasons. That combined with our view on the relative valuation of the stock is what led us to do the $750 million ASR in the fourth quarter. We got 7 million shares as part of that. We still have ways to go on the current share repurchase authorization. So we still have just under $1.6 billion left and we'll continue to execute on that. And the point that's worth mentioning is, as we've said from the beginning, the National General acquisition doesn't impact the buyback program. We fully expect to complete that by the end of the year."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Glenn Shapiro",
            "content": "Thanks Tom. So let's go to Slide 4, and we'll discuss the - as Tom said, very strong performance of our Property-Liability business. Before going deeper into the results, it's worth mentioning that consistent with how we operate under Transformative Growth, Insurance and Allstate Financial results were combined beginning in the third quarter. Property-liability results were strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Growth was modest and lower than prior year quarter for auto insurance, but in the range that we expected as we build the foundation of Transformative Growth. And let me go into some detail on that before continuing on this slide. First, the three components of Transformative Growth were all making progress. The path is a bit steeper though at the beginning for several reasons. One, in our direct business, we lowered advertising for insurance brand since its being sunset, and that has a negative impact on new business there. At the same time, we've improved new business sales flows for online sales and improved our sales practices in our call centers for the Allstate brand being sold direct, which is significantly increasing volumes there but not yet enough to offset the insurance drop. Volume in our Allstate agents channel is on plan, except for the first two months of the pandemic, and we believe the shift in compensation towards new business that we start this year is working. We stopped hiring new agents under the existing commission contract early this year, since we're building a new lower cost agent model. We also increased base level production requirements coming into this year for agents as we're investing in agents who want to grow their business. This resulted in a planned and expected decline in licensed producers as we build the foundation on a high quality set of producers. We were in the right place with the right product at the right time when it comes to Milewise, which is our pay-per-mile product. That's really appealing to customers right now, because they are driving less during the pandemic, and we're the only major carrier offering a product like that. In the independent agent channel, Encompass had a small negative impact on growth, reflecting homeowners increases. National General acquisition which is pending will expand our access into the independent agent channel and we're really excited about the growth prospects there after closing. The cost reductions we're implementing will enable us to further improve our competitive position in auto insurance and drive growth while earning attractive returns. And on the homeowner side, premium grew 2.6% from the prior year quarter. This was due to policy growth of 1.2% and average premium increases. We're really well positioned for further growth in the homeowners business. In total, we believe that the foundation we are building to be a major player in both the direct space and independent agent space that will add to our great exclusive agent channel that we already have will lead to transformative growth. So now we'll go back to our slide and we've got a bullet or two here. Underwriting income was $753 million, increasing $16 million compared to the prior year. While the recorded combined ratio was equal to last year's third quarter, there were many meaningful changes underneath that, which are shown in the lower left chart. Starting on the left, the underlying loss ratio improved 7.8 points, primarily due to lower auto insurance losses from fewer accidents due to lower miles driven. Underlying loss ratio improvement was offset by elevated catastrophe losses in homeowners, unfavorable reserve development in discontinued lines, restructuring charges and Allstate's efforts to help customers during the pandemic, which are all shown in red. Catastrophe losses of $990 million in the third quarter were driven by a very active hurricane season and ongoing wildfires in the West Coast. This is partially offset by favorable prior year catastrophe development recognized in the quarter with $450 million and $45 million respectively coming from the PG&E and Southern California Edison subrogation settlements. Non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates were adverse $70 million in the quarter, this includes $132 million adverse from the annual review of asbestos, environmental and other reserves in the Discontinued Line and Coverage segment, which was partially offset by favorable re-estimates in the Allstate Protection personal lines. The chart on the right breaks down the expense ratio components. Excluding the impact of restructuring charge and bad debt in the third quarter, the expense ratio was 22.6, a 1.1 point improvement compared to prior-year quarter. It also represents a 2.5 point improvement if you go back to 2018. Moving to Slide 5, let's discuss our progress on Transformative Growth. And as Tom covered, Transformative Growth is a multi-year effort to accelerate growth through three components: expanding customer access, improving customer value, and investing in marketing and technology. Customer access was expanded by combining the direct sales capabilities under the Allstate brand, which enables us to leverage insurances capabilities with a stronger brand of Allstate. We're also enhancing local agent sales models to improve effectiveness and efficiency. And customer value is being improved by implementing a cost reduction program. This enables us to offer more affordable prices while maintaining strong margins. We also continue to improve the competitive price position of auto insurance with pricing sophistication. The third component is investing in marketing and technology. In the third quarter, we launched our new advertising campaign to reposition the brand supported by increased spend. Technology investments continue to improve customer facing interactions including the launch of the Allstate OneApp which simplifies all of our digital interactions in access, including telematics offerings. Moving to Slide 6, we're still deeper into a few of the actions taken in the third quarter to advance Transformative Growth. We're executing a cost reduction plan that streamlining operations and processes across claims, sales, service and support functions to lower costs. Lower costs enable us to have more affordable price without sacrificing attractive returns. The plan impacts approximately 3,800 employees this year, which will result in a charge of $290 million, with $198 million of that recognized in the third quarter and the balance in future quarters. The bulk of the charges for employee benefits incentives, including expanded transition support, extended medical coverage and deployment search assistance. The remainder is driven by real estate exit costs. At the same time, we launched a new advertising campaign in September built on the belief that we all deserve to live life well protected, as shown on the right side of the slide. The campaign repositions our brand and updates the messaging to generate business across a broader audience by showing the breadth of product portfolio we have including identity and service protection. The campaign also emphasizes a connected experience with telematics capabilities as customers' behaviors and needs are changing. I'll now turn it over to Mario to cover the rest of our results. No, I think that covers it. Yes, you've covered, Tom. Well, the - going forward, how we bring the cost down and keep margins while being a better value for customers. But I don't want to leave anybody the impression that we're not moving now because sometimes you can look at a like an investor supplement and say, well, it was zero rate taken and think that that means there is zero rate action. We have made hundreds of filings over the last quarter, all across the country and I know you always hear me say it Greg, but we manage this at the market level. So we've got a really talented group of state managers, I always talk about that. They've got their hands on the lever they're looking at, how competitive are we each competitor in this market, what's our close rate doing, what type of shifts are we seeing in customers and quoting and they're moving those levers all the time and we're working with regulators to do that. So the hundreds of filings that we've made already since the pandemic and through this time have materially changed our competitive position in spite of that 0.0, you see on total rate filing. We've done things like improved our competitive position on telematic products, increased new business discounts, changed pricing around for the type of people that are shopping. And so the average person that's out there shopping for insurance is getting a lower price rate now for us than they were six months ago or nine months ago meaningfully lower. And so this is how we stay competitive, and it goes a little bit back to Yaron's comment or question on growth, and I look at it as while we're building this foundation, like I mean we're setting up the capability for us to be a major player in direct. We are setting up the capability for us to be a major player in independent agent with the acquisition that's pending. And while we're building that foundation, I'd call it, we're holding our own. Like we actually grew policies year-over-year, policies in force, minimally in auto more so in home, but we're doing a good job of keeping the fight going and keeping our growth engine going in spite of building that foundation. Yes, so the team that we've had that ran Esurance and has been put together as Allstate as Tom said, with the Allstate Group. And you would think that it would be relatively easy to flip a switch and say, hey, we're a direct company now and accordingly play big in this space. But we literally have decades of connective tissue and process built around everything is an off-ramp for an agency system. And so what we want to be and aspire to be in the near term, is a company that really goes to market in both ways. It's open access for a customer, customer that wants to click our call that we do that really effectively and we can compete with the biggest direct carriers out there. In that space and think about that as a full channel. And then it takes nothing away from the exclusive agent channel we have which is outstanding. They do an incredible job for customers. They've done a great job through the pandemic you can see it in our retention numbers and continue to grow that channel. But the work they've done is really the pick and shovel work of removing some of those pieces of connective tissue between channels and really going to market as a direct business. Esurance was set up that way because it was a separate run operation. This now is common product, its common back end service that we have, but it's a separate sales channel. Yes so in the IA space, it really is National General and I won't get into the brand, because I don't know if any decisions made in terms of exactly the brand. But as Tom said, it's more of a branding with agents than it is with customers in that channel. But with National General and Encompass it's really about bringing those together in sort of a reverse integration because National General has a platform, a technology platform that the IAs love. They have 42,000 existing relationships with agency locations to go along with the 10,000 that we have with Allstate and Encompass. And between the two companies, we have a product set that goes from non-standard all the way up through high net worth and everything in between. And what I always point out on this is, I think maybe the most important part is our homeowners' capability. The IA space they really need that the full stack and all the capabilities and we clearly have a premier homeowners capability at Allstate. So you put all of that together and we will have the most capabilities of any carrier we will be the Number 5 in size, as soon as the closing goes through in the IA space. But we will be number one in terms of overall top to bottom capabilities. That won't be the day that we go live it won't be that because we won't been able to integrate products and everything and push it across. But in short order we will be able to bring those together and really go to that market and be a very major player in the independent agent space. And that, pertaining there was second part to that. No, I'm sorry Answer Financial, thanks. Yes, so on Answer Financial, that is - it's a very different type of model. That really is taking care of customers who we can't take care of in other ways. Are they sort of fall between the cracks of - always narrowing cracks actually at this point because we cover just about all different types of customers at this point. But the narrowing cracks there and it's a way to monetize the exhaust from our expense on marketing and make sure that anybody that comes to us - we can get to at some point. And so Answer Financial from a branding standpoint is separate and they sell multiple carriers. Yes. And thanks for the question, Paul, it is interesting getting into the data in this space. And as Tom said, with billions of miles of data we've got and the partnership with [Aire] we're able to really get into the detail. The short answer to your question is yes. There are absolutely differences state by state. There are broad trends that are true everywhere when you see some of the things about commuting and total miles driven, but you will see based on sort of where states are in the pandemic where they have either formal stay at home orders or shutdowns or anything versus when they have more informal they just have a lot of cases coming in, and just attitude differ by state in terms of how to deal with either staying home or not and so on. So we do see differences by state, but there is enough of a prevailing sort of tailwind on it that there is more similarities than difference. A couple of things, just to go deeper on the comments Tom made before, we see about 40% of our losses happen in rush hour. And so, as we're working through and we predict, again, this gets to different states because obviously in metro areas it's more of a true some of that rush hour than the non-metro areas. But we get a double effect in terms of the frequency of those accidents in rush hour in one fewer people so fewer of our drivers that we insure are actually traveling during rush hour. And so, if you're not traveling, you're not having an accident. And two, the ones who still are, because it's not zero are on less congested roads, so they have fewer accidents, and you see that in the types of accidents that remain. So it is not a pure mix of - if there were a million accidents before and you take out 10% of them. It is not a random 10%. It is a very specific 10%. And so with the mix of what's left is very different and all of these are things that we are looking at in a granular level down to state detail. So that, as I mentioned before, those the pricing actions we take, the go-to-market actions we take are highly specific."

            "name": "Don Civgin",
            "content": "Sure. So, Josh, first, the trends have been strong for a long time. So it's not like this year, all of a sudden SquareTrade took off, they've been doing well since the acquisition. It's been a combination of things that's driven that. It's the growth in the existing customers by which they've been able to help drive with their customers. It's been additional customers that they've added B2B customers additional retailers and then this thing that Mario talked about which is just extending their total addressable market. So three years ago there were largely consumer electronics to U.S. retail. But since then it's the more than consumer electronics, it's now appliances. It's now furniture, it's now international business that's growing dramatically. It's cell carriers and so forth. So it's been kind of expansion across the board, which has been consistent for the last three years. This year's results, you're right, we're impacted by COVID, they were going to be strong regardless. So this was going to be a really great year. We got the benefit of COVID but it wasn't just people buying online, it was the customers that we have the places, people are shopping in the categories that lend themselves to warranties are the ones that customers have been purchasing. So whether it's setting up our own office or setting up consumer electronics as you said. So this year has been good and it's been positively impacted, but I think it would be a big mistake to assume it wouldn't have been good anyway. And then when you get into 2021 and those underlying trends that I talked about that have been going for three years will continue. And so, we still expect them to continue to grow and do well. I suspect at some point the lack of buying power in the economy will probably dampen retail sales across the board, more hard to predict how that's going to happen when that's going to happen. But I think that's the - that's on the margin, the underlying trends will continue in a very strong manner."

            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Good morning everybody. As usual, we appreciate you joining us, investing your time to learn more about Allstate. This was just an exceptional quarter. I mean, we're adapting, we're executing, we're investing for the future. We adapted to the pandemic, the wildfires, the hurricanes, record low interest rates, and despite all of that, our execution enabled us to make $1.1 billion. At the same time, our Transformative Growth is coming to light. The stock is a great value on any measure. So we executed a $750 million ASR. Our team has performed exceptionally well this year, serving customers, creating economic value, and building a stronger foundation for growth. So let's start on Slide 2, which has Allstate's strategy, which is shown by the two ovals on the left. We're going to increase market share on Personal Property-Liability with our Transformative Growth Plan, which has three components. You remember that: expand customer access; improve customer value, which includes improving our price position and launching new products; and then investing in marketing technology. You'll hear more about that from Glenn, and then we'll - and then Mario will go through the numbers, and then we'll get to your questions. We're also expanding our protection businesses to increase - which is increasing the total addressable market we serve. We have an edge in this expansion by leveraging the Allstate brand, our customer base and our operating capabilities, which you can see in between those two ovals. For a company that empowers customers that is, you know we provide affordable simple connected products. There has been plenty to protect them from this year. As I mentioned, we get all kinds of severe weather and catastrophes and there we moved with speed and efficiency, and you can see that from our third quarter results, and those are shown on the right. Our profitability was excellent. Adjusted net income was $2.94 a share, and return on equity 17.7%. Underwriting results also remain really strong, we get favorable auto insurance results which offset the elevated home insurance losses from increased catastrophes. Implementation in Transformative Growth Plan is accelerating with the initiation of cost reduction plan in the new Allstate advertising campaign. Investment income was off slightly due to lower interest rates, but the performance-based income returned to prior year levels. We did have an annual review of our actuarial assumptions for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuity businesses which assumes that the continued low interest rate environment carries forward and reduces future investment income over the next 25 years and that resulted in several charges for the reduced net income, and Mario will go through a specific slide to show you how that works. Allstate Protection Plans has continued to grow policies, revenue and income, while expanding its total addressable market or total addressable market. So despite a tumultuous operating environment, we delivered great customer experiences, growth, excellent returns and progress on the Transformative Growth Plan. If we go to Slide 3, let's do the numbers. Total revenues of $11.5 billion increased 3.9% to the prior year quarter, and that reflects both higher net realized capital gain and growth in property-liability premiums earned. Net income of $1.1 billion increased by 26.7% to the prior year quarter, as you can see that in the table, as higher revenues more than offset Allstate Life and Annuity income in connection - which was down because in connection with those actuarial assumption. Adjusted net income of $923 million was $2.94 per share. It was $23 million lower than the prior year quarter. Its higher auto insurance underwriting income was more than offset by the elevated catastrophe losses or restructuring charges related to Transformative Growth and the lower Allstate Life and Annuities income. Our returns remained excellent, and as I said, the return on equity is well above the range that we've discussed. So let me turn it over to Glenn, who will talk about third quarter results for Personal Property-Liability. Yaron, this is Tom. So they - we can't really give you a quarter and say here's one that turn a say you should buy the stock right before that. So that what is really reflecting the terrible pop because a number of things happening. Right? So we're trying to make sure we take care of our existing customers well, and that requires, as we change out some of the agents and the stuff Glenn talked about, we have to make sure we're doing that well with integrated service and moving people to other agencies. Second, there is obviously a competitive market in which we're in. So part of it depends what happens with our competitors and what they do, how much more they put into advertising, how much they raise homeowners prices. I think that what I would say is the focus seems to be narrowed down to just auto insurance and really transformative growth is about auto insurance is about home insurance where we're getting a growth - good growth and not as much as we think we can have, but certainly higher than auto and then the circle of protection. So I can't really call it by quarter. I would say is, you should expect as you see the components come into place. You should expect to see a trajectory up from here. But we're not giving specific guidance on here. Here's where more going to be at X percent of market share gains. Well we have - average that we have a whole bunch of metrics and we don't give most of them out, because we think we're starting to get in advantage versus our competitors on it and we really don't want them copying what we are doing that in both sub year on to your point, both on things like also in telematics. So we're really positive about what we got going on there. And, but we - I would tell you that the insurance industry in general is not to the level that banks are which says we have a lot of potential to increase our connectivity and lower cost at the same time. Glenn, anything you would add to that? Greg, let me start with the overview on transformer growth and then Glenn, if you could jump into where we are on pricing these. So transformer growth has three components, right. Second one is improved customer value, that is really two components to it. But one is improve the competitive price position and with affordable products. And second is to launch new products, the things like [indiscernible]. So the second piece is really about more differentiation price the cost piece is really the way a door you go through to get to the price piece. So they are not separate. So in the reason we haven't put cost targets out there, we obviously have cost target and we also have price competitive targets. The reason we haven't put those out there is, they are tightly linked. And we don't want to signal to our competitors, where we think we're going our price. So it's not that we don't have targets we do, and we think we can reduce our costs, which enables us to give customers better value called more affordable price without sacrificing attractive margins. So that's the path we're on. Reduce expenses, if those expense is down turn that into a more affordable price, which increases your closed rate, which then drives growth. So the first - it's really one component that you're talking about. The second piece will take some time, because you have to rebuild the whole technology stack, there's just a bunch of work that has to be done to launch new products. That will take a couple of years to really get done, which is why we keep this is a multi-year initiative. Glenn, do you want to give Greg an update on pricing and your thoughts there? Greg, let me go up and then, John you can talk about the risk adjusted return of volatility of the performance base. So - as - when we do our investment allocations all the way at the top, we look at risk adjusted return based on economic capital per asset class and so earlier this year when we sold $4 billion of our $6 billion of public equities, it was because we saw the pandemic come in or we thought there is going to be a dip down and then a bump back up, it was - and we are going to avoid that volatility. We just - we didn't think the risk adjusted return was right. When we look at our market-based results and you're right. Interest rates are coming down there at low rates, really low rates, you're probably not going to have as much capital on those bonds as you had historically. And we looked at the risk adjusted return on the performance space, we decided it was a better risk adjusted return on the performance is now. Obviously, it comes with more volatility and particularly from quarter to quarter, as you point out, so what we did is we matched those performance space, the long-term viability is on dated annuities or capital, which we expect to have for a long time and so when you do that you can handle that in term volatility because - and that's why you get the higher risk adjusted return because you're taking on that volatility. And once you get past seven years, - you're better off owning equities and bonds, as you all know well from just looking at the pension funds. And you get past 10 years and it's like you get double the return and you actually have less risk on equity. So that's how we got to performance-based equities and we're willing to accept that volatility either because we have liabilities or capital which we know will have and will recoup the incremental economic return over time. Before I turn to John let me just - one other thing, as you look forward, what we do of course, is when we're managing our auto business in particular, we look at what underwriting margin do we need given what we think we're going to get in investment income. So to the extent investment income, it goes down, we given our power in underwriting, we're able to still make a good return for our shareholders even with slightly lower interest rates. Unlike some of the life companies who have no other way to adjust their future premiums. So John, do you want to spend a few minutes talking about performance space? Mike, let me first start with the overview and [indiscernible] and Glenn, if you want to talk about sort of sales flows and what you've got going on in sales. And so, we've put together the usage, so if you looked at our old stuff last quarter you would see Esurance broken out and that was 100% direct, either online or through call centers. We did also sell some business under the Allstate brand in the same manner, mostly through call centers, but a little bit online. And with the new format we have, we put those two together. And so, we're not planning on breaking out how much comes out direct and how much comes through agents. You're correct in that if you buy direct, today you get, what you paid for, so you don't pay for an agent. So you don't - the price is 7% lower if you buy direct from the company, but that's for only for new customers. We're not going back to existing customers and saying hey, how would you like the 7% price reduction because they are happy with their existing relationships. They bought from those agents, they have as we cross-sell into those agents. So there is no really need to go disrupt that were about giving it to people anyway they want. If you want an agent you can call us and get an agent and - you call center we'll get you an agent, and you can have a local agent. If you want to do self-serve, and you want to do it online, we'll do that as well. So the strategy is to really leverage the Allstate brand and take that Esurance money which was spent - Esurance advertising money which was hundreds of millions of dollars a year and throw that at the Allstate brand. So, that, we could compete more aggressively with GEICO and Progressive in the direct space. Glenn, do you want to talk about like sales flows and how you're making that work so? First Mike, if you look at the one slide that we've taken annuities down some $75 billion to $17 billion over a period of time. And we've done that with a couple of objectives in mind, what we want to make sure we take care of customers do you want to get a good deal for shareholders. And so we've been kind of whittling away at it and these are the last two chunks we have left. And we're open to different ways to do that and if we look at all different ways to do it all the time so everything from reinsurance to sales, everything else. And so, I don't think lower interest - rates obviously are something you need to factor in. It's less important when you have the investment portfolio that you just mentioned in terms of what it does to the - it helps fill the gap from low interest rates because you're earning higher returns. I think we have decided so this - these are becoming more scarce properties because you've seen the asset managers go out and they like having what I would call captive asset. So there is a whole host of you are all familiar with that throughout and want to buy annuity blocks. So that they can have those assets to manage and then they separately finance the purchase of a company part with their money and part with other people's money it's a way to build a better revenue stream for themselves. We're open to that thing as long as it meets our two objectives. One, you got to take care of our customers. So some of these customers are going to get paid for 30-plus years we don't want to turn that somebody that's going to take it all and go to Las Vegas and put it on red. And then our customers are left hole in the bag. Secondly, we want to make sure it's good deal for our shareholders. So, we're always looking at opportunities to further reduce the exposure. I mean, you look at that trend line. We have a slide that is and it's - there is no reason to expect that we would try to change that trend line. It will go down by itself. So, like they do roll off people to stop collecting payments either because their term is up or they pass away. So, but you should expect it keep going down if we can find the right way to do that for shareholders and customers then we'll do it. So it's Tom. I think it's really one brand. And we have some names, but right now we have one what I would call consumer brand. There is obviously some brands amongst agents. And so, you see us leveraging a brand, not just on direct, but Allstate Protection products. I don't believe we would have gotten Walmart and driven the kind of growth we have without the Allstate team on there and the Allstate backing. Same is true with Home Depot, which will be rolling out starting in January. So it's really one brand. There are - you do point out two other ways if you go to market. So Glenn, could you talk about plans or the independent agent channel Encompass with National General and then just touch on what you're doing with Answer Financial as well? Mario you could take that. [technical difficulty] Josh, because I'm not sure what COVID-normalized are. But I think. I think the shortest way to answer that is we are in really attractive returns on auto insurance. We have for 14-15 years, maybe longer are running and we have a system and an objective and goals that we've achieved to continue that. When I say COVID-normalized, what we don't really know is certainly of course when the pandemic ends which is beyond your normalization. But I'm not sure what it will do to consumer behavior, particularly driving, I think computing is going to be viewed as overrated. And so, given that about a third of the time people are in their cars they're driving to and from work. So if even a small portion of people so 25% of the people commute less. That's a pretty big drop, and we will react to that when we can. I think what it does, it gives us more room to maintain the kind of returns we have while getting more competitive. And so, but you should assume we'll continue to be focused on earning attractive returns. That comment in the press release was really about saying, we didn't have to reduce cost, because we're not making money. There are a lot of people out there who today are airlines and other people were having let people go because they just in trouble. We're not in trouble. We're making really good money. And so we don't need to do it they are reason. We also as we're talking about getting more competitive in auto insurance in particular. We don't want everybody. Moving to the conclusion, which you could, if you took your question farther would be that we're going to do that by given in a way - like say anybody can give it away its talented teams that both grow and make money. And so, we were just trying to point out that the point that and Greg mentioned earlier, which is that the cost and the pricing are tightly linked. And I know a lot of you would like to have some expense ratio target that you could put into your models but trust us, we have a measure. It's a good measure, it's aggressive, but it's tied to what we're trying to do on price. So we're not willing to talk about that publicly. Let me ask Don answer that and then just do a commercial before that, which is - we are stronger being together with SquareTrade than we were independently both in terms of what it does for a server protection and what we do for them in getting Walmart Home Depot leveraging the Allstate brand. But I would say you put this up against any of the recent IPOs out there. This thing is worth a whole lot more than we paid for. Don, do you want to talk about what happened? Add to that is, when you look forward in 2021 in Allstate Protection plans, the mix of policies going to change some. So you'll see the policy growth come, but you will see the revenues continue to accelerate as particularly as we get into bigger dollar amount per policy. So just one thing to get a warranty policy on a iPad, it's another thing for a washer or dryer or for furniture. So you should still see and we expect increased revenue growth, but you may see a slight take off of drop maintaining 51% company growth and policies gets hard as you move into bigger dollar policies. Now I'll take one more question and then we'll wrap up. Glenn, why don't you answer that. I would say, Paul, the other part is with [Aire] tracking 26 million cars, we have 10 times the amount of miles driven that a company that recently went public. And so we got lots of good math on this. So, Glenn, can share with you what he is saying, just in terms of miles driven and what the impact is on frequency. So thank you all for participating. We had an excellent quarter. Mark is obviously available for any follow-up questions the things we didn't get to, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome, everyone, to Allstate's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further context on our strategy to grow personal property-liability market share. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2019 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning. Thank you for joining us this day on Allstate. So let's start on slide 2 of its Allstate's strategy and our second quarter highlights. So our purpose is to protect people from life's uncertainties and to be a positive personal good. And as you know, our strategy has two components: increase personal proper liability and market share and expand into other protection businesses, which are shown in those two ovals. Richest Allstate brands, customers and capabilities to both of those components. This strategy is an adaption the coronavirus pandemic led to excellent operating in the second quarter, as shown on the right hand. The enterprise customer experience score increased as employees and agencies did an excellent job of working remote, and we benefited from leading on the shelter-in-place payback and helping customers in other ways. Profitability was good with adjusted net income of $2.46 per share. We also made progress at our multiyear transformative growth plan by leveraging the direct sales capabilities of Esurance and lowering expenses. Allstate Protection Plans, which, as you know, we acquired 3.5 years ago for $1.4 billion and high-growth and high returns, section plans [Technical Difficulty] at the end of 2017 and estimated adjusted net income of $35 million in the quarter and $69 million for the first six months of 2020. The performance-based core losses in the quarter reduced reported net investment income despite solid total loan growth. Our profitable growth it depends overall [Technical Difficulty]. We move to slide 3. I'll say quickly excellent operating results, total revenues of $11.2 billion increased 0.5% of the prior year for gain and growth in the property-liability premium earned were -- that more than offset the decline in investment income for performance-based losses. Net income of $1.2 billion increased 49% to the prior year quarter, as you can see from the middle of the table market value in just $380 million 2019, $2.46 per share, 12.8% of other than repurchase program. With adjusted net income mature line at 17.8%. [Technical Difficulty]\nGlenn Shapiro: Thanks, Tom. Let's go to slide 4, where we'll discuss the strong performance of our Property-Liability segment. Premium and policy growth continued with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Policies in force were $33.8 million at the end of the quarter, and Allstate brand policies reaching an all-time high for auto at $20.5 million. Underwriting income of $904 million increased by $537 million compared to the prior year quarter. The chart on the lower left shows the second quarter combined ratio of 89.8% and the impacts driving the 6-point improvement over the prior year quarter. Starting on the left the underlying loss ratio improved by 15.9 points on lower auto insurance losses from fewer accidents, due to significant reduction in miles driven. The underlying loss ratio on homeowners insurance also improved due to increased premiums and lower non-catastrophe losses. The underlying loss ratio improvements were partially offset by Allstate's efforts to help customers during the pandemic. This included the 15% shelter in place payback on auto, which totaled 8.3% of premiums across all lines of on business, plus a 0.5% of premiums from increased bad debt expense, due to billing flexibility related to the Allstate special payment plan. The chart on the right breaks down the expense ratio components. The expense ratio was 23.0 and improved 0.5 point compared to the prior year quarter, excluding the $738 million shelter-in-place payback and bad debt expenses in the quarter. As you know, one portion of our transformative growth plan is to deliver better value to customers, in part by reducing operating expenses. While expenses vary by quarter, as you can see from this quarter, the long-term trend has been down as you look at the adjusted numbers, which are 2.1 points below 2018 expense ration. So let's now move to slide 5 and discuss transformative growth in more detail. The transformative growth plan will accelerate growth through three key levers: expanding customer access, enhancing customer value and investing in technology and marketing. We're expanding customer access and increasing product availability by leveraging Esurance's direct sales capabilities under the Allstate brand. The Esurance brand will be sunset over time, and the advertising spend will be concentrated on the Allstate brand. This also includes improving online and call center sales flows. We're enhancing customer value through continued cost structure improvements, which will make prices more competitive without reducing underwriting margins. We recently announced changes in the personal Property-Liability organization, which included combining our direct operations as well as consolidating Allstate brand field operations to further lower costs. To improve customer value, we're also expanding telematics offerings and promoting our unique Milewise pay-by-mile product, which is appealing to customers right now as they're driving less during the pandemic. The third component is investing in technology and marketing. Technology investments are improving our customer experience, including the recent launch of Allstate One app that simplifies and combines digital access and telematics offerings in one place. Launching the transformative growth plan also enhances our ability to adapt to a post coronavirus operating environment. We'll have lower cost structure and more competitive prices. We're also building the capacity to invest in new products, marketing and technology while maintaining strong margins. The new technology platform will allow us to be more connected with customers and give us greater flexibility to change products and processes going forward. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario to discuss the rest of our second quarter results.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Glenn. Let's go to slide 6, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. We take a proactive and holistic approach to managing the investment portfolio. After reducing public equity in the first quarter, we increased our allocation to investment-grade corporate bonds this quarter. The chart at the left shows net investment income totaled $409 million in the quarter, which was $533 million below prior year, due to a decline in market-based income and losses in the performance-based portfolio. Market-based income, shown in blue, was below the prior year quarter by $77 million. As interest rates have declined, reinvestment rates are below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield, reducing portfolio income. We recorded $211 million loss on our performance-based investments in the second quarter, as shown in gray. As you know, we proactively adjusted valuations in the first quarter in response to the significant decline in equity markets. In the second quarter, we followed our standard process for recording performance-based results, which generally recognizes valuations on a one-quarter lag. Given this lag in income recognition, the second quarter improvement in public equity markets did not have a positive impact on this portfolio in the quarter. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. The second quarter return of 5% primarily reflects tighter credit spreads and the impact of higher equity valuations on the $2.8 billion public equity portfolio. Year-to-date returns were 2.7% and the latest 12 months was 5.9%. Performance-based investments had a 2.4% and 4.5% loss for the quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. These investments are expected to generate higher returns than the market-based portfolio, and consequently, typically have higher volatility. This portfolio has generated an annualized rate of return of 7.4% over the past five years, as shown in the bottom right of the table. Let's move to slide seven and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits, and Annuities. Allstate Life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $72 million in the second quarter, an increase of $4 million compared to the prior year quarter. Life insurance mortality was elevated in the second quarter, driven by $25 million in identified coronavirus death claims. Excluding these claims, mortality experience was favorable relative to expected levels. Despite higher mortality from the pandemic, Allstate Life generated attractive returns as lower operating expenses supported an increase in adjusted net income for the second quarter. Allstate Benefits premiums declined 7.4% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the non-renewal of a large underperforming account in the fourth quarter of 2019, lower sales from increased competition, and the economic impact of the coronavirus, including higher employee turnover, business closures, and furloughs. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $5 million in the second quarter was $32 million below the prior year quarter, reflecting a $32 million after-tax write-off for software associated with the billing system. We are developing a technology strategy to build an end-to-end digital platform over time that modernizes more than just our billing system and enables us to maintain our strong position in the voluntary Benefits marketplace. Allstate Annuities, shown in the bottom right, had an adjusted net loss of $111 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the lower performance-based investment results that I discussed earlier. Let's turn to slide eight to discuss the results of the Service Businesses. Service Businesses revenue, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, grew 15.4% to $457 million in the second quarter. Policies in force continued to grow, increasing 41.2% and to $127.3 million in the second quarter, largely due to growth in Allstate Protection Plans. Allstate Identity Protection policies in force increased $1.1 million from the prior year quarter to $2.3 million and includes subscribers accepting our free service offer through the remainder of the year as a result of the pandemic. Adjusted net income improved to $38 million in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting an increase of $22 million compared to the second quarter of last year, driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services. Allstate Protection Plans has outperformed expectations across each acquisition measure of success established following the $1.4 billion acquisition in 2017. Those measures of success include rapidly growing new and existing domestic customers, raising profitability and returns on capital deployed, and creating sustainable growth beyond U.S. retail. As you can see in the chart on the right, Allstate Protection Plans has grown rapidly. Policies in force increased fourfold over the last three and a half years from less than 30 million policies in 2017 to more than $120 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 53%. This growth trajectory reflects expansion within both the U.S. and international markets. Allstate Protection Plans also began generating positive adjusted net income in the first quarter of 2018 and continues to experience upward trajectory with added scale, generating $35 million of adjusted net income in the second quarter of 2020 and $96 million over the latest 12 months. As you can see, Allstate Protection Plans has consistently grown customers, revenue, and profits since the acquisition. Slide nine highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate's capital position remains strong, due to our diversified business model, substantial earnings capacity and proactive capital management. We continue to generate strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 17.9% as of the end of the second quarter. We returned $563 million to common shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of $391 million in share repurchases and $172 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year, we have repurchased 5.2% of outstanding shares as you can see from the table. And as of June 30, there was $2.4 billion remaining on the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Book value per share of $79.21 was 17.7% higher than the second quarter of 2019, reflecting strong net income and an increase in fixed income unrealized capital gains, partially offset by cash return to shareholders. Allstate's stock valuation metrics, however, have not kept pace with this continued strength and strong operating performance. Moving to Slide 10. This quarter, we also entered into an agreement to acquire National General. This acquisition is financially attractive and will create a platform to drive profitable growth in the independent agent channel. National General will become Allstate's independent agent platform. We will essentially do a reverse merger of our Encompass and Allstate independent agent businesses into National General, which has a good technology platform, broad distribution and a management team that has substantial acquisition integration experience. The deal will increase Allstate's total personalized market share by over one point and create a top five competitor in the independent agent channel personal lines market. It also generates opportunities for growth and expense efficiencies. It gives us a strong presence in higher risk, nonstandard auto insurance, Allstate's expertise in standard auto and home insurance will be used to leverage national General's independent agent relationships by broadening the product offering. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings and returns in the first year. We expect high single-digit earnings accretion in the first year post close, and adjusted net income return on equity is expected to increase by about 100 basis points. These impacts anticipate cost synergies but do not include the incremental revenue growth opportunity. The transaction will have no impact on Allstate's existing share repurchase program. The second quarter was a busy one, where we continued to address the impact of the pandemic earned good returns for shareholders and position Allstate for long-term profitable growth. With that context, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. So my first question is just looking at the expense ratio, adjusted for bad debt and the payback improving by 50 basis points, maybe a little more with \u2013 when you adjust for the ad spend. How much of that is from the transformative growth program? And how much is just simply COVID-driven?\nTom Wilson: Yaron?\nYaron Kinar: Yes. Can you hear me?\nTom Wilson: Yes.\nYaron Kinar: So Tom, I think we're having difficulties hearing you. I was able to hear Mario and the others on the call, but I've not been able to really hear you. I'm not sure if there's somebody on the line \u2013 if my line is open. I can't hear.\nGlenn Shapiro: Your line is open. His line is definitely \u2013 the phone is definitely not coming through clearly.\nDon Civgin: Mario, do you want to jump in on that one?\nMark Nogal: Why don't we have this? And then let's \u2013 Tom, maybe if you could dial back in. Go ahead, Mario.\nMario Rizzo: Oh, you want me \u2013 okay. Thanks, Yaron. So, I guess, what I'd say is, as we've talked about transformative growth, I'll just remind you, there's three core elements, as Glenn talked about. There's expanding customer access, enhancing the customer value proposition and continuing to invest in technology and marketing to support the broader transformative growth program. And improving our cost structure is a key part of how we're going to achieve that second objective of enhancing customer value. We continue to make really good progress on this front. Our underwriting expense ratio, as you indicated, is down 0.5 point once you adjust out the coronavirus impacts to 23 in the quarter, and it's down eight-tenths of a point compared to last year. And when you look at where the improvement came from, it's in acquisition-related expenses and operating costs. And that's an area that, as we've talked about, those are two of the areas that we're obviously focused on taking cost out. So we've been at this now for over a year. And I'd say our cost reductions, again, are a core part of transformative growth. So I'd say that's really what we're focused on doing as part of the plan. And we're \u2013 we would expect to continue to take costs out over time. And we'll continue to look for ways to improve processes and enhance efficiency and through a variety of means that support the transformative growth program.\nYaron Kinar: I guess, what I was trying to get at is, how much of the improvement this quarter is sticky? And how this quarter is just reduction in T&E and in office costs, given that we were in a shelter-in-place environment?\nMario Rizzo: Yeah. And, I guess, what I'd say, Yaron, is we're going to look to continue to drive cost out of the system. So I don't think \u2013 the expense ratio may bounce around a little bit going forward, as we invest in technology. You saw us \u2013 we invested more in marketing in the quarter. But I guess the way we're thinking about it is, our intent is to drive the expense ratio down over time, and that's what we're going to do.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. My second question, I think in the past, you've said that you're not looking to cut rates, but we are seeing some of your competitors starting to cut more meaningfully here. Favorable frequency experience probably also helps. Are you holding to your decision?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So I'll jump in and take that one. This is Glenn, but thanks for the question, Yaron. I think, first of all, we're seeing \u2013 there's one competitor that took some meaningful action more broadly. I don't think we're seeing a huge rush in direction, for one. Our competitors have been aggressive. And it's a competitive environment, but not irrational. And the second point I'd make is we manage this on a local level. And I know I'm a broken record, I say this every quarter when we talk about how we manage the \u2013 both the margins and our pricing. Over the course of the last 60 days, this could look like, with our flat rate environment, that our product people have just sort of been hanging around and waiting for something. We've actually made 180 filings over the last over the last two months. And what we do is we're constantly, in each state and each market, looking at how we pull and push levers to be competitive in the environment. It's why we saw sequential growth. And we've continued to grow in spite of a tough environment. And those filings were things like, making new business more competitive, making our telematics offering more competitive with some incentives in that area and across all 50 states, pulling different levers like that. So I would say that, while we don't favor, as you said, sort of a broad base like we're just going to cut X amount everywhere. We do favor being very surgical, very detailed and very thoughtful about how we manage our competitive position and our margin in each market. And I think you know from over time that we react quickly, whether it was the frequency spike back in 2015, or it's the frequency decline now of 2020 that we move really quickly on these things, and we have a very responsive system. And we react market-by-market and make sure that we return a very good return to our shareholders. But at the same time, we stay competitive and we're able to grow profitably.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you and best of luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thank you. Given the strong results that you've been seeing, obviously, pretty favorable frequency results in the quarter, are there any plans for further rebates within your auto insurance book?\nGlenn Shapiro: So, this is Glenn. Thanks, Elyse. I'll take that as well. I think what we're looking at now, and as I mentioned in the last question to Yaron, we're looking at sustainable and more sophisticated instruments. We're looking at how we get competitive with those as opposed to what I think was the right decision and a good way to go about it with the shelter-in-place payback at the moment. It needed a broad and blunt instrument because of the big move in frequency at that time. But when you wrap-in frequency and then the mix shift that moves severity and the expansion of coverage, the increase of bad debt because we get more flexible for customers in need, put all of those things together, I think the go-forward approach is going to be more in the lines of allowing our losses to flow into our rating as we always do, and to be more precise on a state-by-state and market-by-market basis versus a broad shelter-in-place payback. Things could change because depending on how the frequency and how the virus moves and all of that, but our thinking right now is to be more -- look at more sustainable tools than a shelter-in-place payback going forward.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, could you give us a sense of how frequency and severity trends have trended in July versus what you saw in the second quarter as we kind of -- as folks that started to go back to work and, et cetera, we've seen a change in loss trends?\nMario Rizzo: This is Mario. Glenn, can talk about the second quarter, but we're not going to talk about July trends at this point.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yeah. So I'll talk about the second quarter a little bit and to say, first of all, thanks for mentioning frequency and severity because they do tend to move in opposite directions with one another. And one thing, I'll just proactively address is that I know some of our competitors report a recorded number on severity. We report a paid number and paid calendar quarter is, I think, a more transparent and better metric to use in normal times, but we're in anything but normal times. So it's much, much more volatile and subject to mix shifts. So you'll see the number move more just because of the mix of what's being paid inside the quarter where you have fewer short-tail, small claims being paid in the period and everything, so that you'll see the two things move a little bit opposite one another. But what we saw throughout the quarter, and we did disclose that June was less of a difference in gross severity -- frequency, excuse me, than the other months in the quarter -- is that it has come down. It's starting to normalize in some places. There's a lot more variation by state early on like what we would see in April and May is that while there was some variation, pretty much all the states were down within a relatively close tolerance to one another. That has started to diverge more with a really rural state like Montana, for example, was actually up slightly in the year-over-year. And then you've got places that are more significantly down, particularly states that are more heavily concentrated with metro areas and that have had more spikes of the virus. So we're watching things on a very local level into how they're moving.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. I'm going to pivot and I'd like to get an update on your homeowners business. I was looking at some of the statistics that you provide, like on page 17 of your supplement. And I was struck by the improvements in frequency, both gross claim and paid claim frequency, not just in the first and second quarters of this year, but it seems to be a longer term trend. And I would be curious about your impressions about what's driving that and how we should think about those trends as we look beyond just this year and think about next year.\nDon Civgin: Greg, it's Don Civgin. I'll ask Glenn to answer it in more detail. And we've obviously worked hard on our homeowners business over the last number of years, and so we're pleased with the returns we're getting from that business. But Glenn, do you want to get into more specifics?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Don. So yes, as Don said, I'm always -- I always preach that -- look at the long term and look at the reported combined on home. We've got year-to-date and 88.6% combined ratio recorded. Our 12 months is 83%, and our 5-year is 87%. So we've sustained that. I think, Greg, your point on the frequency is a tough one because it changes almost every quarter because the weather drives so much of it. So you'll have more caught up in catastrophes, and so it's sort of a lower underlying frequency, and then you'll have maybe a good weather quarter and you have few weather-driven and fewer cats. They move around a lot. What I would say recently, and this is probably an underreported part of the COVID impact, is that we've seen a shift in frequency severity on the home side because -- and it's pretty logical is we're seeing fewer like death claims and break-ins because everybody's home. And those tend to be lower severity claims, and yet we're seeing about the same number of fire points, and those tend to be higher severity claims. So we saw our frequency go down in the quarter. Our severity average go up because the ones that went away were smaller claims. And so we get into the details, and we look at all of those components, but I wouldn't necessarily draw a conclusion that there's something in home driving long-term frequency down that will be sustainable. I think it's been different factors each quarter.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks for that answer. And then I guess I'll circle back your transformative growth plan and the integrated services platform. And as you guys know, I always like to track your agency data that you provide on page 9 of your supplement. And so I was wondering if you could just, from a big picture perspective, we're watching some directional changes in some of the numbers, whether it's a slight decrease in total Allstate agencies and LSPs, but we're also seeing an increase in the independent agencies and Encompass independent agencies, can you walk us through what your view is on how that's going to change further as we continue to roll out these plans that you've mentioned previously?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Glenn, why don't you go ahead?\nGlenn Shapiro: Okay, great. So you're always into the detail, Greg. So you definitely picked up on the right trends there. We're focused on growing with agencies looking to invest, and this ties back to something Mario talked about the expenses. It's not that our acquisition costs have gone down because we don't want to grow and we don't want to invest in agents looking to grow. They've gone down because we've moved the money really in a way that incentivizes growth and it's more efficient to do it that way. So coming into this year, we moved some money that was incentivizing retention, and we moved it to incentivize new business. And -- or I should say renewal versus new business as opposed to retention because how it gets paid. That's one change. And that changed some agents, who wanted to invest in that way, and some that didn't and perhaps voted themselves out on that one. We also increased our baseline performance requirements for, I'll call it, our lowest producing agency and required that folks sort of be more open for business than they have been. And so that has driven the number down a little bit. And the other thing is integrated service, which you mentioned in the question. That number will start to look strange over time. We have about 500 agents in there right now. So those agents won't show staff members that are being augmented or provided by Allstate. And so it kind of moves the number to a different place because we don't report it in as part of the agency staff as licensed sales professionals because we're doing the work on the back end for them in those centers. So there's a number of pieces moving it. But I think the headline to take away is that we've grown in the agency plan. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we've all-time high in Allstate brand auto policies in force. So the agency force has grown, and we want to grow in all of our lines. We want to grow all state agents. We want to grow our independent agent channel, which is the pending acquisition that we've got with National general, and we want to grow in direct, which is the combination of Esurance and Allstate Direct.\nTom Wilson: Hey, Greg, this is Tom Wilson. I'm \u2013 hopefully, I've reconnected.\nMark Nogal: We can hear you.\nTom Wilson: All right. Let me highlight what Glenn just said. So, transformative growth, so we're going to sell as much as we can through everybody as we can. So we want to have more Allstate agents. We want to have independent agents. We want to sell more. You will see, over time, some increases decreases and how much goes through each of those channels as we transition to or a profit model. So \u2013 and Glenn explained what we're doing on new business versus a retention. But we're really working on different ways we can get to customers. We may not need as much real estate in the future as we have today. That means local offices are different. So you'll see changes, and you're seeing some of that change now because we're not new Allstate agents at this point as we build out these new models. So it's really about very distribution force.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thank you for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Could you guys \u2013 and maybe I missed it, did you guys touch on auto severity? I think, we \u2013 investors have expected it to increase during COVID. Maybe you can discuss whether we should expect the severity or you could talk about it, so we can maybe better understand whether it should continue? And I'm curious whether, like, the underlying severity trend is still kind of higher for longer due to issues we talked about pre-COVID? Or is there a change to that potentially post-COVID?\nTom Wilson: Mike, let me have Glenn answer that, but give you an overview first. In a time like this, where the numbers are changing rapidly in terms of the number of claims, they \u2013 the statistics in the method you use for any individual component of loss costs bounce around a lot. So it's \u2013 the best thing to do is to look at overall loss costs and say, are your loss costs still the right percentage of your premiums? We obviously have done attribution on severity, and Glenn can talk about that.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yeah. So it's a great question because, as Tom said, I mean, they do bounce around a lot. Overall, we feel very comfortable and confident with where we are on severity. PD severity, paid severity was reported at 20% up, which number jumps off the page. Let me give you just an example of why that is on a paid severity number like that. So paid severity is \u2013 as you'd expect, it's a number of claims you settled and closed during that calendar period divided by the total number of claims, and you get your average. Well, during the second quarter, we settled just as many six-month-old claims as we would in any normal quarter, because six months earlier, there was no COVID and there was no drop in frequency. We settled just as many five-month-old claims and four-month old-claims and three-month-old claims, but we settled a lot fewer three-day-old claims. And one-week-old claims, because they just weren't there. They weren't happening with the same frequency and as you'd expect, the claims you settle in three, four and five days are lower severity on average. They're quick. They're easy, and they're low cost. The ones that are six months are typically ones that have like they've gone through their own carrier. The segregation comes over from that carrier, they average a much higher severity type of claim, or they've been a total loss, and so they take longer to process and so on. So it's just a pure mix issue that drives that type of number. When we get down underneath that, and we're able to look at the things that come in, in the quarter and how they're resolving and are estimating practices and what the true severity looks like, it feels like normal inflation that we've seen in the single digits that we're very comfortable with. And the claims team has done and the finance team a terrific job of getting underneath the data so that we understand where and if we have any pressures, but we've seen it run very predictably.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. That's very helpful. And lastly, my follow-up. Services segment, it feels like, driven by Allstate Protection continues to do, I think, better than expected, and it's actually kind of moving the needle a little bit these days. You talked about diversifying into \u2013 outside of the U.S. I mean, just since it's growing so fast, should we expect the rate of growth to temper? Any additional color there would be around what's going on would be helpful.\nTom Wilson: Let me provide just overview like why we talked about it, and then Don can talk about its future. So, when we bought it, one of the things we said was, we'll come back and talk to you about how we're doing every so often. And that's what we wanted to do here. And it's meeting and exceeding our expectations. I think there are a number of people. We're trying to understand why we were into that space, and you can see it's a huge growth. And we've had huge growth both domestically, and we're starting to get some good growth internationally. So, it was really about coming back to you and saying, we told you we'd come back, and here we are. And it happens to be a good news story, which Don can talk about.\nDon Civgin: Yes. Thank you. So, first, thanks for noticing. The service businesses, I think, in total, have made a lot of progress and has improved the values that they provide to customers. And so I think across the Board, they're doing really good work, more specifically around the Allstate Protection Plans. I mean, Mario laid out the three goals that we set and how we're doing against them. But I'd remind you, we set those goals the first quarter after we did the acquisition, and we communicated those, and we've been consistent about them. And we have had a really strong trajectory since we acquired SquareTrade, both on the topline and improvements in profitability all along the way. This particular quarter was good, but I'd remind you we expected to have a good 2020 to begin with. And that's because we were continuing to pick up new customers. We were doing a really good job working with our partners to make the product more available and accessible to their customers. And so we expect the growth not only for new business-to-business customers, but also more availability in existing customers and our international business continues to grow substantially. So, we expected 2020 to be good. We have benefited from the virus in some ways, and topline is one of them. When you look at the partners that we do our largest business with, they tend to be the larger one-stop shops. Which, as you would know, have been in favor in the retail world -- retail is doing mix these days. But if you're a large one-stop shop, we've done quite well. In the categories that we are particularly in consumer electronics and so forth and home office, have also done very well. So, we benefited because of the virus with the topline. And then, obviously, the topline has a benefit to the bottom-line with respect to scale of the expenses and so forth. So, we're very happy with the results. The results would have been strong even without the virus. They have clearly been helped to buy the virus, both on the topline and the bottom-line. But we're still very happy with the underlying performance as well. The only thing I'd add is, it's hard to tell what the impact of the virus is going to be going forward. And that's just going to depend on consumer behavior, where they buy, what they buy. So, while we benefited from impacts from the virus at this point, it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the future. But all that said, the underlying business has been and continues to be quite strong and we're quite bullish on it.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. I wanted to ask about bad debt trends within the quarter itself. And I guess I'm wondering whether or not we could see more when the Federal subsidies for unemployment go away or if maybe the bad debt is more tied to some of the state level moratoriums on -- that were in place. Just your thoughts on that would be great.\nTom Wilson: Mario, do you want to take that?\nMario Rizzo: Sure. Paul, this is Mario. So, just to give you a little context of the driver of bad debt, as we mentioned earlier, one of the ways that we provided additional benefits to our customers during the pandemic was to offer them the opportunity to opt into a special payment plan, which essentially gives them 60 days of coverage without having to make a payment on the policy. That started in March. And we've \u2013 as we've worked our way through the quarter, we've gotten more and more experience relative to how that subset of customers has performed and then the bad debt activity within that customer segment, because as much as we had historical context around offering similar-type programs during catastrophes, this was obviously much more widespread and different. And you see the impact in the quarter where bad debt was $44 million. We'll continue to get more and more experience on that customer set going forward. We'll continue to update our analysis, and then we'll update the numbers in the third quarter, if we need to. But based on the experience we've seen so far through the end of Q2, that's what we recorded in the P&L.\nTom Wilson: And Paul, I would wrap that into just the overall pandemic impact, right? So we've obviously had lower frequency, which we've talked a lot about. This is another cost associated with the pandemic. And when we're thinking about what we're going to do in the future, we factor all this stuff in.\nPaul Newsome: Makes sense. Second question, I wanted to ask about whether or not you think the regulators will take into account sort of the, hopefully, one-time nature of the pandemic? Or if we put through \u2013 when you put through rate filings in the future, will you kind of have this middle of the Python kind of situation where the unusual low frequency is embedded in what you can file for rates prospectively until that kind of rolls off through the system.\nTom Wilson: Well, it's always hard for us, of course, to speak for somebody else as to what they will do. And of course, it varies by state, which oftentimes relates to the political environment in that state. What I can say is, we were out early, no regulator forces to do shelter-in-place payback or expand coverage and all the other things we did. And so we got out ahead of it. I think we got positive feedback from people that we were doing what was not required, like no one had to come in and say, you must do this. And so I feel like we're on a good basis to work through like what's the right price. And if frequency were to stay at these abnormal lows, obviously, regulators, customers in the competitive market wouldn't have you charge the same amount. The good news is our loss cost would be a lot better. So our focus, really, Paul, is on maintaining our overall competitive position and our margins. And we've been able to do that with regulators. I think there'll be a whole bunch of stories. But the good news is we have good math, an operating model that adjusts locally in a way in which we can continue then grow profitably. Glenn, anything you would add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: No. I think that covered it well.\nPaul Newsome: Thanks for your help. Everyone, stay safe, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore. Your question please.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. Just a question for Tom and Glenn. Just thinking bigger picture, I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about miles driven and accident frequency over the longer term. And I know there's a lot of uncertainty, but are you guys thinking -- how are you guys thinking about miles driven and accident frequency? Do you think that we'll ever get back to levels that we were at pre-COVID, especially given what seems like increasingly prevalent adoption of remote working arrangements? And relatedly, how are you guys going to adjust to potential lower frequency levels on a more sustained basis?\nTom Wilson: Let me start, Glenn and then jump in. I'm going to start, David, the most macro which is of course, our strategy includes a couple of different components, the top over Property-Liability and then the bottom of other stuff. In the Property-Liability stuff, there's auto, big driver of that. And as -- and that's a key part of our both revenue and profitability. But the other thing is, we have a really profitable homeowners business, much more profitable than other people. We're good at it. We're precise at it. We sell a bunch of other stuff. And then the circle protection selling things like the service plans and everything is about making sure the company has multiple things we can sell to customers to protect them from whatever goes wrong in their life and leverage those customer bases. So we're dealing with -- because you had the same question that was about the same question about the future of auto was really around autonomous vehicles 3 or 4 years ago. And so we've been on that path from a strategic standpoint as to how to deal with that. And, of course, what's happened is, actually, premiums have gone up, not down in the last 4 or 5 years, which people were afraid nobody was going to drive. So it's really hard to predict. What you can do is have multiple options and take advantage of those options and leverage your skills and capabilities. As it relates to the auto insurance business, you want to have a broad-based approach. And that's what transformative growth really is. It's improve the customer value proposes, give people lots of access, connect to more, make your products more simple. And so we still have a lot of the share of that market we can pick up. And so even if you were to say fewer miles driven, lower average premium, we still think we can grow that business. Glenn, you might want to have some -- that was obvious sort of macro and longer term. How would you react to the question on more really as it relates to personal Profit-Liability in the shorter term?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. And it's a great question because, obviously, we think a lot about this. Let me take you into how the team works on this. And I'll go -- like Tom did, I'll go before even the virus. We had built out a model and assumptions for the change in frequency driven purely by the change in the car fleet out in the market. What does each component of ADAS, safety equipment on cars, what does each component do to change each type of loss, like how many fewer sideswipes or rear ends or intersection actions are we going to have based on the blind spot warning or based on this autonomous feature or so on? And you add those up and you apply them to your fleet and how the fleet is changing over time, and we actually -- we've built into the model, our assumptions were what changes. But at the same time, we built the other side of it, which is the severity. Because all those cars getting into fewer accidents are a heck of a lot more expensive to fix when they have all that equipment on it. And so it goes to what Tom said about, really, it's hard to predict, but we go after it and we look at with as much specificity as we can, the component parts. So now take that into the current scenario and the question you're asking. And we're looking at, so what percentage of the market works in jobs that don't have to commute? If you work in a restaurant or your dental hygienist or like -- but you're going to have to commute because those things cannot be done remotely. But there are a lot of jobs, most of us have jobs that can be done more remotely than they have been historically. So you get that percentage. And then you look at, well, what percentage of people will do it, and then what percentage of your accidents occur in like high drive time, and you start making your assumptions and picks over what's going to change. And similarly, that then changes severity because one of the things we've learned is that the losses that go away quickest are the bumper-to-bumper accidents in high traffic, and those tend to be low severity. So while a 10% decrease in frequency is great, it's not necessarily a 10% decrease in loss costs. And the reason I'm getting into or micro, since Tom took the macro on this and laid it out, is hopefully just to give you confidence that we look at this in a very detailed way and a thoughtful way, and our teams work through what the expectations are, and then we're able to move quickly on the fly when we're either above or below it with what our prediction is.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thanks for that comprehensive answer. I appreciate that. And if I could just sneak in just one more on just a quick numbers question. If I think about that 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio, if I take out the one-time-ish items in 2Q, and then it was roughly 80 basis points in the first half versus the first half last year, is that -- and I know there are a lot of different moving pieces there, but is that the sort of level of year-over-year improvement that we should expect to see going forward?\nTom Wilson: Yes. I would say transformative growth is about reducing expenses. In part, it's just one component, but it's about reducing expenses, so we can improve our customer value proposition with better prices, without impacting our margins. But it's going to bounce around a lot by quarter. You got advertising. We're going to have \u2013 we have new advertising. We're going to launch \u2013 you have some technology spend. But you should expect the overall trend going down. I don't think we could predict how much it will change by every quarter because \u2013 or set a target that way, because then it leaves unnatural consequences. So \u2013 but you should expect it to keep going down, yes.\nDavid Motemaden: No. Thanks fair. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your question, please.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the frequency benefit issue, if I could. I get that you want to be more surgical in terms of how you're approaching this, as opposed to more broad-based, which makes sense, but, I guess, the question is, do you \u2013 are you comfortable or confident that you won't see an impact on policy growth to the extent that some of your competitors actually stick with much more of a broad-based approach?\nTom Wilson: Well, it's always hard to tell what customers will do. We've always found that precision works for us on the long term, and that those people who rush to grow and not have precision to it, end up having to fix it later. So if you look at homeowners, people trying to grow in homeowners are taking huge losses. Like, we just don't think that's the right way to build the business, because you get the customer for a price that's not appropriate, and then you either have to lose them or manage them to a much higher price. So, all I can say is, what we'll do. But it's a reasonably \u2013 it's a highly competitive market, but it's a thoughtful market, right? Like people are not crazy in this market and trying to use bad economics. So all of our major competitors understand their business well and why they might make different bets at different times. I feel like, the basis of competition is still going to stay the same. Whoever is the smartest, win.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. And then I just wanted to ask one on the National General deal, if I could. I see that you're still guiding to this, I guess, high single-digit accretion, I think, was the original guidance. But when we were running the math, just based on where expectations were for Allstate and Nat General based on consensus, we were getting something close to high single digit or in a high single digits EPS accretion, without factoring in any cost synergies. So I'm just trying to understand, is there any help that you can give us in terms of what you're building in with respect to cost synergies? I don't think you talked about on the last call, but any help there would be appreciated.\nTom Wilson: What, I would say is, we don't own it yet. So our projections haven't really changed. We do have cost saves in the middle of it that we figured out in terms of what we factored in when we bought \u2013 when we agreed to pay the price we did. And it did lead to accretion, as you point out. But right now, we're working on -- Glenn and Barry are working hard on what is the transition program. So as we get more specifics on things that we can lay out for you that are, here's our measurable goals, we'll do that. But, right now, we're just like a month into it.\nSuneet Kamath: All right. Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Thank you.\nMark Nogal: Jonathan, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Certainly. Then our final question for today comes from the line Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your question, please.\nRyan Tunis: Good morning. This might be a question for Glenn, but it seems like there's some decoupling between trends in miles driven and trends in frequency with, I guess, the latter declining quite a bit more. I guess my question is, what indicators that you're seeing in your book do you think are actually the best predictive indicators of what frequency is doing in this current environment?\nTom Wilson: That's a tough question. I will let Glenn do that one.\nGlenn Shapiro: Thanks. So it's a good question. And you're right about the decoupling, so I'll give you a little background on that. Not all miles are created equal. If you're driving in a high-traffic environment, you are much more likely to get an accident because it's less forgiving. You take your eyes off the road. You're distracted driving, which, by the way, I don't recommend at any time. But if you're doing it in loose traffic and you make a mistake, you're less likely to bump into somebody than when you're doing it in high traffic. So what we're seeing is with commuting miles being way down, that has a little bit of an exponential effect on frequency. So if miles came back to a new normal for non-commuting, but were lower only on commuting, it would have a disproportionate effect on the frequency. So hopefully, that answers your question. It's \u2013 we're looking at the data in that way. And our \u2013 with the partnership with Arity and the partnerships they have with a lot of the non-insurance companies out there, and they get a lot of miles-driven data on those, and that what they do for us with our own data, is extremely helpful in that.\nTom Wilson: And Ryan \u2013 and Glenn's example also is goes for rural and urban too, right? So think of the same thing, not just time and day also. So Montana, the frequency is not down as much as it is in urban areas because there's fewer people. There's always less congestion. So it is a difficult question. But the good news is we're on top of it. I know you all have another call. Thank you for participating and listening to our story. We'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Glenn Shapiro",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's go to slide 4, where we'll discuss the strong performance of our Property-Liability segment. Premium and policy growth continued with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Policies in force were $33.8 million at the end of the quarter, and Allstate brand policies reaching an all-time high for auto at $20.5 million. Underwriting income of $904 million increased by $537 million compared to the prior year quarter. The chart on the lower left shows the second quarter combined ratio of 89.8% and the impacts driving the 6-point improvement over the prior year quarter. Starting on the left the underlying loss ratio improved by 15.9 points on lower auto insurance losses from fewer accidents, due to significant reduction in miles driven. The underlying loss ratio on homeowners insurance also improved due to increased premiums and lower non-catastrophe losses. The underlying loss ratio improvements were partially offset by Allstate's efforts to help customers during the pandemic. This included the 15% shelter in place payback on auto, which totaled 8.3% of premiums across all lines of on business, plus a 0.5% of premiums from increased bad debt expense, due to billing flexibility related to the Allstate special payment plan. The chart on the right breaks down the expense ratio components. The expense ratio was 23.0 and improved 0.5 point compared to the prior year quarter, excluding the $738 million shelter-in-place payback and bad debt expenses in the quarter. As you know, one portion of our transformative growth plan is to deliver better value to customers, in part by reducing operating expenses. While expenses vary by quarter, as you can see from this quarter, the long-term trend has been down as you look at the adjusted numbers, which are 2.1 points below 2018 expense ration. So let's now move to slide 5 and discuss transformative growth in more detail. The transformative growth plan will accelerate growth through three key levers: expanding customer access, enhancing customer value and investing in technology and marketing. We're expanding customer access and increasing product availability by leveraging Esurance's direct sales capabilities under the Allstate brand. The Esurance brand will be sunset over time, and the advertising spend will be concentrated on the Allstate brand. This also includes improving online and call center sales flows. We're enhancing customer value through continued cost structure improvements, which will make prices more competitive without reducing underwriting margins. We recently announced changes in the personal Property-Liability organization, which included combining our direct operations as well as consolidating Allstate brand field operations to further lower costs. To improve customer value, we're also expanding telematics offerings and promoting our unique Milewise pay-by-mile product, which is appealing to customers right now as they're driving less during the pandemic. The third component is investing in technology and marketing. Technology investments are improving our customer experience, including the recent launch of Allstate One app that simplifies and combines digital access and telematics offerings in one place. Launching the transformative growth plan also enhances our ability to adapt to a post coronavirus operating environment. We'll have lower cost structure and more competitive prices. We're also building the capacity to invest in new products, marketing and technology while maintaining strong margins. The new technology platform will allow us to be more connected with customers and give us greater flexibility to change products and processes going forward. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario to discuss the rest of our second quarter results. Your line is open. His line is definitely \u2013 the phone is definitely not coming through clearly. Yes. So I'll jump in and take that one. This is Glenn, but thanks for the question, Yaron. I think, first of all, we're seeing \u2013 there's one competitor that took some meaningful action more broadly. I don't think we're seeing a huge rush in direction, for one. Our competitors have been aggressive. And it's a competitive environment, but not irrational. And the second point I'd make is we manage this on a local level. And I know I'm a broken record, I say this every quarter when we talk about how we manage the \u2013 both the margins and our pricing. Over the course of the last 60 days, this could look like, with our flat rate environment, that our product people have just sort of been hanging around and waiting for something. We've actually made 180 filings over the last over the last two months. And what we do is we're constantly, in each state and each market, looking at how we pull and push levers to be competitive in the environment. It's why we saw sequential growth. And we've continued to grow in spite of a tough environment. And those filings were things like, making new business more competitive, making our telematics offering more competitive with some incentives in that area and across all 50 states, pulling different levers like that. So I would say that, while we don't favor, as you said, sort of a broad base like we're just going to cut X amount everywhere. We do favor being very surgical, very detailed and very thoughtful about how we manage our competitive position and our margin in each market. And I think you know from over time that we react quickly, whether it was the frequency spike back in 2015, or it's the frequency decline now of 2020 that we move really quickly on these things, and we have a very responsive system. And we react market-by-market and make sure that we return a very good return to our shareholders. But at the same time, we stay competitive and we're able to grow profitably. So, this is Glenn. Thanks, Elyse. I'll take that as well. I think what we're looking at now, and as I mentioned in the last question to Yaron, we're looking at sustainable and more sophisticated instruments. We're looking at how we get competitive with those as opposed to what I think was the right decision and a good way to go about it with the shelter-in-place payback at the moment. It needed a broad and blunt instrument because of the big move in frequency at that time. But when you wrap-in frequency and then the mix shift that moves severity and the expansion of coverage, the increase of bad debt because we get more flexible for customers in need, put all of those things together, I think the go-forward approach is going to be more in the lines of allowing our losses to flow into our rating as we always do, and to be more precise on a state-by-state and market-by-market basis versus a broad shelter-in-place payback. Things could change because depending on how the frequency and how the virus moves and all of that, but our thinking right now is to be more -- look at more sustainable tools than a shelter-in-place payback going forward. Yeah. So I'll talk about the second quarter a little bit and to say, first of all, thanks for mentioning frequency and severity because they do tend to move in opposite directions with one another. And one thing, I'll just proactively address is that I know some of our competitors report a recorded number on severity. We report a paid number and paid calendar quarter is, I think, a more transparent and better metric to use in normal times, but we're in anything but normal times. So it's much, much more volatile and subject to mix shifts. So you'll see the number move more just because of the mix of what's being paid inside the quarter where you have fewer short-tail, small claims being paid in the period and everything, so that you'll see the two things move a little bit opposite one another. But what we saw throughout the quarter, and we did disclose that June was less of a difference in gross severity -- frequency, excuse me, than the other months in the quarter -- is that it has come down. It's starting to normalize in some places. There's a lot more variation by state early on like what we would see in April and May is that while there was some variation, pretty much all the states were down within a relatively close tolerance to one another. That has started to diverge more with a really rural state like Montana, for example, was actually up slightly in the year-over-year. And then you've got places that are more significantly down, particularly states that are more heavily concentrated with metro areas and that have had more spikes of the virus. So we're watching things on a very local level into how they're moving. Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Don. So yes, as Don said, I'm always -- I always preach that -- look at the long term and look at the reported combined on home. We've got year-to-date and 88.6% combined ratio recorded. Our 12 months is 83%, and our 5-year is 87%. So we've sustained that. I think, Greg, your point on the frequency is a tough one because it changes almost every quarter because the weather drives so much of it. So you'll have more caught up in catastrophes, and so it's sort of a lower underlying frequency, and then you'll have maybe a good weather quarter and you have few weather-driven and fewer cats. They move around a lot. What I would say recently, and this is probably an underreported part of the COVID impact, is that we've seen a shift in frequency severity on the home side because -- and it's pretty logical is we're seeing fewer like death claims and break-ins because everybody's home. And those tend to be lower severity claims, and yet we're seeing about the same number of fire points, and those tend to be higher severity claims. So we saw our frequency go down in the quarter. Our severity average go up because the ones that went away were smaller claims. And so we get into the details, and we look at all of those components, but I wouldn't necessarily draw a conclusion that there's something in home driving long-term frequency down that will be sustainable. I think it's been different factors each quarter. Okay, great. So you're always into the detail, Greg. So you definitely picked up on the right trends there. We're focused on growing with agencies looking to invest, and this ties back to something Mario talked about the expenses. It's not that our acquisition costs have gone down because we don't want to grow and we don't want to invest in agents looking to grow. They've gone down because we've moved the money really in a way that incentivizes growth and it's more efficient to do it that way. So coming into this year, we moved some money that was incentivizing retention, and we moved it to incentivize new business. And -- or I should say renewal versus new business as opposed to retention because how it gets paid. That's one change. And that changed some agents, who wanted to invest in that way, and some that didn't and perhaps voted themselves out on that one. We also increased our baseline performance requirements for, I'll call it, our lowest producing agency and required that folks sort of be more open for business than they have been. And so that has driven the number down a little bit. And the other thing is integrated service, which you mentioned in the question. That number will start to look strange over time. We have about 500 agents in there right now. So those agents won't show staff members that are being augmented or provided by Allstate. And so it kind of moves the number to a different place because we don't report it in as part of the agency staff as licensed sales professionals because we're doing the work on the back end for them in those centers. So there's a number of pieces moving it. But I think the headline to take away is that we've grown in the agency plan. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we've all-time high in Allstate brand auto policies in force. So the agency force has grown, and we want to grow in all of our lines. We want to grow all state agents. We want to grow our independent agent channel, which is the pending acquisition that we've got with National general, and we want to grow in direct, which is the combination of Esurance and Allstate Direct. Yeah. So it's a great question because, as Tom said, I mean, they do bounce around a lot. Overall, we feel very comfortable and confident with where we are on severity. PD severity, paid severity was reported at 20% up, which number jumps off the page. Let me give you just an example of why that is on a paid severity number like that. So paid severity is \u2013 as you'd expect, it's a number of claims you settled and closed during that calendar period divided by the total number of claims, and you get your average. Well, during the second quarter, we settled just as many six-month-old claims as we would in any normal quarter, because six months earlier, there was no COVID and there was no drop in frequency. We settled just as many five-month-old claims and four-month old-claims and three-month-old claims, but we settled a lot fewer three-day-old claims. And one-week-old claims, because they just weren't there. They weren't happening with the same frequency and as you'd expect, the claims you settle in three, four and five days are lower severity on average. They're quick. They're easy, and they're low cost. The ones that are six months are typically ones that have like they've gone through their own carrier. The segregation comes over from that carrier, they average a much higher severity type of claim, or they've been a total loss, and so they take longer to process and so on. So it's just a pure mix issue that drives that type of number. When we get down underneath that, and we're able to look at the things that come in, in the quarter and how they're resolving and are estimating practices and what the true severity looks like, it feels like normal inflation that we've seen in the single digits that we're very comfortable with. And the claims team has done and the finance team a terrific job of getting underneath the data so that we understand where and if we have any pressures, but we've seen it run very predictably. No. I think that covered it well. Yes. And it's a great question because, obviously, we think a lot about this. Let me take you into how the team works on this. And I'll go -- like Tom did, I'll go before even the virus. We had built out a model and assumptions for the change in frequency driven purely by the change in the car fleet out in the market. What does each component of ADAS, safety equipment on cars, what does each component do to change each type of loss, like how many fewer sideswipes or rear ends or intersection actions are we going to have based on the blind spot warning or based on this autonomous feature or so on? And you add those up and you apply them to your fleet and how the fleet is changing over time, and we actually -- we've built into the model, our assumptions were what changes. But at the same time, we built the other side of it, which is the severity. Because all those cars getting into fewer accidents are a heck of a lot more expensive to fix when they have all that equipment on it. And so it goes to what Tom said about, really, it's hard to predict, but we go after it and we look at with as much specificity as we can, the component parts. So now take that into the current scenario and the question you're asking. And we're looking at, so what percentage of the market works in jobs that don't have to commute? If you work in a restaurant or your dental hygienist or like -- but you're going to have to commute because those things cannot be done remotely. But there are a lot of jobs, most of us have jobs that can be done more remotely than they have been historically. So you get that percentage. And then you look at, well, what percentage of people will do it, and then what percentage of your accidents occur in like high drive time, and you start making your assumptions and picks over what's going to change. And similarly, that then changes severity because one of the things we've learned is that the losses that go away quickest are the bumper-to-bumper accidents in high traffic, and those tend to be low severity. So while a 10% decrease in frequency is great, it's not necessarily a 10% decrease in loss costs. And the reason I'm getting into or micro, since Tom took the macro on this and laid it out, is hopefully just to give you confidence that we look at this in a very detailed way and a thoughtful way, and our teams work through what the expectations are, and then we're able to move quickly on the fly when we're either above or below it with what our prediction is. Thanks. So it's a good question. And you're right about the decoupling, so I'll give you a little background on that. Not all miles are created equal. If you're driving in a high-traffic environment, you are much more likely to get an accident because it's less forgiving. You take your eyes off the road. You're distracted driving, which, by the way, I don't recommend at any time. But if you're doing it in loose traffic and you make a mistake, you're less likely to bump into somebody than when you're doing it in high traffic. So what we're seeing is with commuting miles being way down, that has a little bit of an exponential effect on frequency. So if miles came back to a new normal for non-commuting, but were lower only on commuting, it would have a disproportionate effect on the frequency. So hopefully, that answers your question. It's \u2013 we're looking at the data in that way. And our \u2013 with the partnership with Arity and the partnerships they have with a lot of the non-insurance companies out there, and they get a lot of miles-driven data on those, and that what they do for us with our own data, is extremely helpful in that."

            "content": "Mario, do you want to jump in on that one? Greg, it's Don Civgin. I'll ask Glenn to answer it in more detail. And we've obviously worked hard on our homeowners business over the last number of years, and so we're pleased with the returns we're getting from that business. But Glenn, do you want to get into more specifics? Yes. Thank you. So, first, thanks for noticing. The service businesses, I think, in total, have made a lot of progress and has improved the values that they provide to customers. And so I think across the Board, they're doing really good work, more specifically around the Allstate Protection Plans. I mean, Mario laid out the three goals that we set and how we're doing against them. But I'd remind you, we set those goals the first quarter after we did the acquisition, and we communicated those, and we've been consistent about them. And we have had a really strong trajectory since we acquired SquareTrade, both on the topline and improvements in profitability all along the way. This particular quarter was good, but I'd remind you we expected to have a good 2020 to begin with. And that's because we were continuing to pick up new customers. We were doing a really good job working with our partners to make the product more available and accessible to their customers. And so we expect the growth not only for new business-to-business customers, but also more availability in existing customers and our international business continues to grow substantially. So, we expected 2020 to be good. We have benefited from the virus in some ways, and topline is one of them. When you look at the partners that we do our largest business with, they tend to be the larger one-stop shops. Which, as you would know, have been in favor in the retail world -- retail is doing mix these days. But if you're a large one-stop shop, we've done quite well. In the categories that we are particularly in consumer electronics and so forth and home office, have also done very well. So, we benefited because of the virus with the topline. And then, obviously, the topline has a benefit to the bottom-line with respect to scale of the expenses and so forth. So, we're very happy with the results. The results would have been strong even without the virus. They have clearly been helped to buy the virus, both on the topline and the bottom-line. But we're still very happy with the underlying performance as well. The only thing I'd add is, it's hard to tell what the impact of the virus is going to be going forward. And that's just going to depend on consumer behavior, where they buy, what they buy. So, while we benefited from impacts from the virus at this point, it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the future. But all that said, the underlying business has been and continues to be quite strong and we're quite bullish on it."

            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining us this day on Allstate. So let's start on slide 2 of its Allstate's strategy and our second quarter highlights. So our purpose is to protect people from life's uncertainties and to be a positive personal good. And as you know, our strategy has two components: increase personal proper liability and market share and expand into other protection businesses, which are shown in those two ovals. Richest Allstate brands, customers and capabilities to both of those components. This strategy is an adaption the coronavirus pandemic led to excellent operating in the second quarter, as shown on the right hand. The enterprise customer experience score increased as employees and agencies did an excellent job of working remote, and we benefited from leading on the shelter-in-place payback and helping customers in other ways. Profitability was good with adjusted net income of $2.46 per share. We also made progress at our multiyear transformative growth plan by leveraging the direct sales capabilities of Esurance and lowering expenses. Allstate Protection Plans, which, as you know, we acquired 3.5 years ago for $1.4 billion and high-growth and high returns, section plans [Technical Difficulty] at the end of 2017 and estimated adjusted net income of $35 million in the quarter and $69 million for the first six months of 2020. The performance-based core losses in the quarter reduced reported net investment income despite solid total loan growth. Our profitable growth it depends overall [Technical Difficulty]. We move to slide 3. I'll say quickly excellent operating results, total revenues of $11.2 billion increased 0.5% of the prior year for gain and growth in the property-liability premium earned were -- that more than offset the decline in investment income for performance-based losses. Net income of $1.2 billion increased 49% to the prior year quarter, as you can see from the middle of the table market value in just $380 million 2019, $2.46 per share, 12.8% of other than repurchase program. With adjusted net income mature line at 17.8%. [Technical Difficulty] Yaron? Yes. Hey, Greg, this is Tom Wilson. I'm \u2013 hopefully, I've reconnected. All right. Let me highlight what Glenn just said. So, transformative growth, so we're going to sell as much as we can through everybody as we can. So we want to have more Allstate agents. We want to have independent agents. We want to sell more. You will see, over time, some increases decreases and how much goes through each of those channels as we transition to or a profit model. So \u2013 and Glenn explained what we're doing on new business versus a retention. But we're really working on different ways we can get to customers. We may not need as much real estate in the future as we have today. That means local offices are different. So you'll see changes, and you're seeing some of that change now because we're not new Allstate agents at this point as we build out these new models. So it's really about very distribution force. Mike, let me have Glenn answer that, but give you an overview first. In a time like this, where the numbers are changing rapidly in terms of the number of claims, they \u2013 the statistics in the method you use for any individual component of loss costs bounce around a lot. So it's \u2013 the best thing to do is to look at overall loss costs and say, are your loss costs still the right percentage of your premiums? We obviously have done attribution on severity, and Glenn can talk about that. Let me provide just overview like why we talked about it, and then Don can talk about its future. So, when we bought it, one of the things we said was, we'll come back and talk to you about how we're doing every so often. And that's what we wanted to do here. And it's meeting and exceeding our expectations. I think there are a number of people. We're trying to understand why we were into that space, and you can see it's a huge growth. And we've had huge growth both domestically, and we're starting to get some good growth internationally. So, it was really about coming back to you and saying, we told you we'd come back, and here we are. And it happens to be a good news story, which Don can talk about. Mario, do you want to take that? And Paul, I would wrap that into just the overall pandemic impact, right? So we've obviously had lower frequency, which we've talked a lot about. This is another cost associated with the pandemic. And when we're thinking about what we're going to do in the future, we factor all this stuff in. Well, it's always hard for us, of course, to speak for somebody else as to what they will do. And of course, it varies by state, which oftentimes relates to the political environment in that state. What I can say is, we were out early, no regulator forces to do shelter-in-place payback or expand coverage and all the other things we did. And so we got out ahead of it. I think we got positive feedback from people that we were doing what was not required, like no one had to come in and say, you must do this. And so I feel like we're on a good basis to work through like what's the right price. And if frequency were to stay at these abnormal lows, obviously, regulators, customers in the competitive market wouldn't have you charge the same amount. The good news is our loss cost would be a lot better. So our focus, really, Paul, is on maintaining our overall competitive position and our margins. And we've been able to do that with regulators. I think there'll be a whole bunch of stories. But the good news is we have good math, an operating model that adjusts locally in a way in which we can continue then grow profitably. Glenn, anything you would add to that? Let me start, Glenn and then jump in. I'm going to start, David, the most macro which is of course, our strategy includes a couple of different components, the top over Property-Liability and then the bottom of other stuff. In the Property-Liability stuff, there's auto, big driver of that. And as -- and that's a key part of our both revenue and profitability. But the other thing is, we have a really profitable homeowners business, much more profitable than other people. We're good at it. We're precise at it. We sell a bunch of other stuff. And then the circle protection selling things like the service plans and everything is about making sure the company has multiple things we can sell to customers to protect them from whatever goes wrong in their life and leverage those customer bases. So we're dealing with -- because you had the same question that was about the same question about the future of auto was really around autonomous vehicles 3 or 4 years ago. And so we've been on that path from a strategic standpoint as to how to deal with that. And, of course, what's happened is, actually, premiums have gone up, not down in the last 4 or 5 years, which people were afraid nobody was going to drive. So it's really hard to predict. What you can do is have multiple options and take advantage of those options and leverage your skills and capabilities. As it relates to the auto insurance business, you want to have a broad-based approach. And that's what transformative growth really is. It's improve the customer value proposes, give people lots of access, connect to more, make your products more simple. And so we still have a lot of the share of that market we can pick up. And so even if you were to say fewer miles driven, lower average premium, we still think we can grow that business. Glenn, you might want to have some -- that was obvious sort of macro and longer term. How would you react to the question on more really as it relates to personal Profit-Liability in the shorter term? Yes. I would say transformative growth is about reducing expenses. In part, it's just one component, but it's about reducing expenses, so we can improve our customer value proposition with better prices, without impacting our margins. But it's going to bounce around a lot by quarter. You got advertising. We're going to have \u2013 we have new advertising. We're going to launch \u2013 you have some technology spend. But you should expect the overall trend going down. I don't think we could predict how much it will change by every quarter because \u2013 or set a target that way, because then it leaves unnatural consequences. So \u2013 but you should expect it to keep going down, yes. Well, it's always hard to tell what customers will do. We've always found that precision works for us on the long term, and that those people who rush to grow and not have precision to it, end up having to fix it later. So if you look at homeowners, people trying to grow in homeowners are taking huge losses. Like, we just don't think that's the right way to build the business, because you get the customer for a price that's not appropriate, and then you either have to lose them or manage them to a much higher price. So, all I can say is, what we'll do. But it's a reasonably \u2013 it's a highly competitive market, but it's a thoughtful market, right? Like people are not crazy in this market and trying to use bad economics. So all of our major competitors understand their business well and why they might make different bets at different times. I feel like, the basis of competition is still going to stay the same. Whoever is the smartest, win. What, I would say is, we don't own it yet. So our projections haven't really changed. We do have cost saves in the middle of it that we figured out in terms of what we factored in when we bought \u2013 when we agreed to pay the price we did. And it did lead to accretion, as you point out. But right now, we're working on -- Glenn and Barry are working hard on what is the transition program. So as we get more specifics on things that we can lay out for you that are, here's our measurable goals, we'll do that. But, right now, we're just like a month into it. That's a tough question. I will let Glenn do that one. And Ryan \u2013 and Glenn's example also is goes for rural and urban too, right? So think of the same thing, not just time and day also. So Montana, the frequency is not down as much as it is in urban areas because there's fewer people. There's always less congestion. So it is a difficult question. But the good news is we're on top of it. I know you all have another call. Thank you for participating and listening to our story. We'll talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Glenn. Let's go to slide 6, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. We take a proactive and holistic approach to managing the investment portfolio. After reducing public equity in the first quarter, we increased our allocation to investment-grade corporate bonds this quarter. The chart at the left shows net investment income totaled $409 million in the quarter, which was $533 million below prior year, due to a decline in market-based income and losses in the performance-based portfolio. Market-based income, shown in blue, was below the prior year quarter by $77 million. As interest rates have declined, reinvestment rates are below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield, reducing portfolio income. We recorded $211 million loss on our performance-based investments in the second quarter, as shown in gray. As you know, we proactively adjusted valuations in the first quarter in response to the significant decline in equity markets. In the second quarter, we followed our standard process for recording performance-based results, which generally recognizes valuations on a one-quarter lag. Given this lag in income recognition, the second quarter improvement in public equity markets did not have a positive impact on this portfolio in the quarter. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. The second quarter return of 5% primarily reflects tighter credit spreads and the impact of higher equity valuations on the $2.8 billion public equity portfolio. Year-to-date returns were 2.7% and the latest 12 months was 5.9%. Performance-based investments had a 2.4% and 4.5% loss for the quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. These investments are expected to generate higher returns than the market-based portfolio, and consequently, typically have higher volatility. This portfolio has generated an annualized rate of return of 7.4% over the past five years, as shown in the bottom right of the table. Let's move to slide seven and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits, and Annuities. Allstate Life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $72 million in the second quarter, an increase of $4 million compared to the prior year quarter. Life insurance mortality was elevated in the second quarter, driven by $25 million in identified coronavirus death claims. Excluding these claims, mortality experience was favorable relative to expected levels. Despite higher mortality from the pandemic, Allstate Life generated attractive returns as lower operating expenses supported an increase in adjusted net income for the second quarter. Allstate Benefits premiums declined 7.4% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the non-renewal of a large underperforming account in the fourth quarter of 2019, lower sales from increased competition, and the economic impact of the coronavirus, including higher employee turnover, business closures, and furloughs. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $5 million in the second quarter was $32 million below the prior year quarter, reflecting a $32 million after-tax write-off for software associated with the billing system. We are developing a technology strategy to build an end-to-end digital platform over time that modernizes more than just our billing system and enables us to maintain our strong position in the voluntary Benefits marketplace. Allstate Annuities, shown in the bottom right, had an adjusted net loss of $111 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the lower performance-based investment results that I discussed earlier. Let's turn to slide eight to discuss the results of the Service Businesses. Service Businesses revenue, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, grew 15.4% to $457 million in the second quarter. Policies in force continued to grow, increasing 41.2% and to $127.3 million in the second quarter, largely due to growth in Allstate Protection Plans. Allstate Identity Protection policies in force increased $1.1 million from the prior year quarter to $2.3 million and includes subscribers accepting our free service offer through the remainder of the year as a result of the pandemic. Adjusted net income improved to $38 million in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting an increase of $22 million compared to the second quarter of last year, driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services. Allstate Protection Plans has outperformed expectations across each acquisition measure of success established following the $1.4 billion acquisition in 2017. Those measures of success include rapidly growing new and existing domestic customers, raising profitability and returns on capital deployed, and creating sustainable growth beyond U.S. retail. As you can see in the chart on the right, Allstate Protection Plans has grown rapidly. Policies in force increased fourfold over the last three and a half years from less than 30 million policies in 2017 to more than $120 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 53%. This growth trajectory reflects expansion within both the U.S. and international markets. Allstate Protection Plans also began generating positive adjusted net income in the first quarter of 2018 and continues to experience upward trajectory with added scale, generating $35 million of adjusted net income in the second quarter of 2020 and $96 million over the latest 12 months. As you can see, Allstate Protection Plans has consistently grown customers, revenue, and profits since the acquisition. Slide nine highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate's capital position remains strong, due to our diversified business model, substantial earnings capacity and proactive capital management. We continue to generate strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 17.9% as of the end of the second quarter. We returned $563 million to common shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of $391 million in share repurchases and $172 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year, we have repurchased 5.2% of outstanding shares as you can see from the table. And as of June 30, there was $2.4 billion remaining on the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Book value per share of $79.21 was 17.7% higher than the second quarter of 2019, reflecting strong net income and an increase in fixed income unrealized capital gains, partially offset by cash return to shareholders. Allstate's stock valuation metrics, however, have not kept pace with this continued strength and strong operating performance. Moving to Slide 10. This quarter, we also entered into an agreement to acquire National General. This acquisition is financially attractive and will create a platform to drive profitable growth in the independent agent channel. National General will become Allstate's independent agent platform. We will essentially do a reverse merger of our Encompass and Allstate independent agent businesses into National General, which has a good technology platform, broad distribution and a management team that has substantial acquisition integration experience. The deal will increase Allstate's total personalized market share by over one point and create a top five competitor in the independent agent channel personal lines market. It also generates opportunities for growth and expense efficiencies. It gives us a strong presence in higher risk, nonstandard auto insurance, Allstate's expertise in standard auto and home insurance will be used to leverage national General's independent agent relationships by broadening the product offering. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings and returns in the first year. We expect high single-digit earnings accretion in the first year post close, and adjusted net income return on equity is expected to increase by about 100 basis points. These impacts anticipate cost synergies but do not include the incremental revenue growth opportunity. The transaction will have no impact on Allstate's existing share repurchase program. The second quarter was a busy one, where we continued to address the impact of the pandemic earned good returns for shareholders and position Allstate for long-term profitable growth. With that context, let's open up the line for questions. Oh, you want me \u2013 okay. Thanks, Yaron. So, I guess, what I'd say is, as we've talked about transformative growth, I'll just remind you, there's three core elements, as Glenn talked about. There's expanding customer access, enhancing the customer value proposition and continuing to invest in technology and marketing to support the broader transformative growth program. And improving our cost structure is a key part of how we're going to achieve that second objective of enhancing customer value. We continue to make really good progress on this front. Our underwriting expense ratio, as you indicated, is down 0.5 point once you adjust out the coronavirus impacts to 23 in the quarter, and it's down eight-tenths of a point compared to last year. And when you look at where the improvement came from, it's in acquisition-related expenses and operating costs. And that's an area that, as we've talked about, those are two of the areas that we're obviously focused on taking cost out. So we've been at this now for over a year. And I'd say our cost reductions, again, are a core part of transformative growth. So I'd say that's really what we're focused on doing as part of the plan. And we're \u2013 we would expect to continue to take costs out over time. And we'll continue to look for ways to improve processes and enhance efficiency and through a variety of means that support the transformative growth program. Yeah. And, I guess, what I'd say, Yaron, is we're going to look to continue to drive cost out of the system. So I don't think \u2013 the expense ratio may bounce around a little bit going forward, as we invest in technology. You saw us \u2013 we invested more in marketing in the quarter. But I guess the way we're thinking about it is, our intent is to drive the expense ratio down over time, and that's what we're going to do. This is Mario. Glenn, can talk about the second quarter, but we're not going to talk about July trends at this point. Yes. Glenn, why don't you go ahead? Sure. Paul, this is Mario. So, just to give you a little context of the driver of bad debt, as we mentioned earlier, one of the ways that we provided additional benefits to our customers during the pandemic was to offer them the opportunity to opt into a special payment plan, which essentially gives them 60 days of coverage without having to make a payment on the policy. That started in March. And we've \u2013 as we've worked our way through the quarter, we've gotten more and more experience relative to how that subset of customers has performed and then the bad debt activity within that customer segment, because as much as we had historical context around offering similar-type programs during catastrophes, this was obviously much more widespread and different. And you see the impact in the quarter where bad debt was $44 million. We'll continue to get more and more experience on that customer set going forward. We'll continue to update our analysis, and then we'll update the numbers in the third quarter, if we need to. But based on the experience we've seen so far through the end of Q2, that's what we recorded in the P&L."

And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.  Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation, along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com.  Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further context on our response to the coronavirus pandemic. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements throughout Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2019 and other public documents for information on potential risks.  And now I'll turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Wilson: Good morning. Thank you for joining us from wherever you are sheltered in place. Let's jump right in with Allstate's response to the coronavirus pandemic on Slide 2.  Allstate has been helping customers overcome catastrophes for 89 years, and we've learned to act decisively, quickly and put customers first. As a result, we've led the industry in helping customers. We created a Shelter-in-Place Payback program of more than $600 million. Special payment plans are being used for customers experiencing financial challenges. Auto insurance coverage was expanded to cover the use of personal vehicles to deliver food, medicine and other goods for commercial purposes. Allstate Identity Protection is being offered for free for the rest of the year to all U.S. residents, given the increased exposure to cybercrime.  Business continuity plans were executed. Virtual sales and support capabilities were expanded. We leveraged our digital innovations, such as QuickFoto Claim and Virtual Assist, to better protect our customers, employees and agents.  Employees and Allstate agents moved to more than 95% working remotely, and we altered a number of business practices to support our agents and employees. At the same time, Allstate is financially strong with significant capital and liquidity. In February, we reduced our public equity holdings by $4 billion to reduce the amount of economic capital back in the investment portfolio. But this turned out to be good timing because it enabled us to reduce the impact of the market downturn in March. And as Mario will cover later, we will maintain our share repurchase program given the strong capital position.  For our communities, the Allstate Foundation announced an additional $5 million. That's on top of the money we normally grant every year, which is substantial to help deal with the pandemic and double demand for Allstate employees' need. Move to Slide 3. Let's touch base with Allstate's strategy. As you know, our strategy has two components: increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand into other protection businesses. This 2-part strategy leads to our 5 annual operating priorities, which is shown on the right side of this page, and we made good progress around all five.  If you move to Slide 4, Allstate had strong operating and financial results in the first quarter. Total revenues of $10.1 billion declined 8.3% for the prior year quarter due to capital losses instead of capital gains in the prior year. If you exclude the impact of the realized capital losses, revenues increased 2%, driven by a 4.4% increase in Property-Liability insurance premiums, which you can see from the table.  Net income of $513 million declined to the prior year quarter's increased underwriting income, was more than offset by capital losses and charges for pension and postretirement benefits. Adjusted net income, shown in the middle of the table, was $1.1 billion in the quarter or $3.54 per diluted share, which was significantly above the prior year, reflecting lower catastrophe losses. Returns were excellent with adjusted net income return on equity improving to 18.2%.  Mario will now discuss the first quarter results in more detail.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's go to Slide 5 to discuss the strong performance of our Property-Liability segment. Starting with the chart on the left, policy and premium growth continued, with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Underwriting income of $1.35 billion in the first quarter was $645 million higher than the prior year quarter with a combined ratio of 84.9.  The improvement to prior year was driven by several factors, including lower catastrophe losses, increased premiums earned and lower auto accident frequency from the decline in miles driven. Auto accident frequency was significantly lower in the quarter, with property damage gross frequency down 12% compared to the prior year quarter. For the month of March, property damage gross frequency declined 27% compared to the prior year, as miles driven dropped significantly, as states began implementing social distancing measures. These benefits were partially offset by increased severity and the Shelter-in-Place Payback expense.  The chart on the right shows our Property-Liability expense ratio over time and specifically highlights the $210 million Shelter-in-Place Payback expense we recorded in the first quarter, which increased the expense ratio by 2.4 points. Excluding this impact, the expense ratio improved by 1 point compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting continued progress on enhancing the customer value proposition, which is one of the key components of our Transformative Growth Plan.  Let's go to Slide 6, which highlights investment performance for the first quarter. As you'd expect, our first quarter investment portfolio results reflect the impact of the market volatility caused by the coronavirus. As shown in the table in the middle of the page, total return for the first quarter was a negative 2.4%, largely reflecting lower portfolio valuation. While the decline in treasury rates supported fixed income prices, the significant widening of credit spreads more than offset that benefit, and interest-bearing valuation decline reduced return by 1.9%. Lower equity valuations further decreased returns by another 1%.  The chart shows net investment income of $421 million in the quarter, which was $227 million lower than the prior year. We recorded a loss of $208 million for performance-based results in the first quarter, as shown in gray. As you may recall, the income on our limited partnership is typically booked on a 1-quarter lag. Performance-based income related to fourth quarter 2019 sponsored financial statement was $176 million. We also recorded write-downs of $137 million on 4 underperforming private equity investments. In a typical quarter, this is where our process would have ended. However, given market volatility and economic disruption, we also recognized declines in the value of limited partnership interest, where we had enough information to make informed estimates rather than solely relying on sponsored financial statement as of December 31. This included updating publicly traded investments held within limited partnership to their March 31 market pricing, which reduced investment income by $52 million.  We also did not recognize $195 million of unrealized valuation increases reported in sponsor's fourth quarter financial statements. The sum total of these 4 items generated the $208 million performance-based loss in Q1. Because these investments exhibit idiosyncratic risk and return, future gains and losses are uncertain. But we believe utilizing this approach in the quarter is a better indication of current value.  Income from the market-based portfolio, shown in blue, was lower than the prior year quarter by $19 million, reflecting the impact of lower reinvestment rates. We expect this trend to continue to the extent reinvestment rates remain below average interest-bearing portfolio yield.  Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our portfolio positioning. We take a disciplined and proactive approach to managing the investment portfolio risk and return profile, and our positioning has mitigated the impact of the current crisis. As you can see in the chart on the left of the page, the portfolio is largely made up of high-quality fixed income securities with substantial liquidity. We extended the duration of our Property-Liability portfolio last year, which was -- which has supported both income and returns in the lower rate environment. We are conservatively positioned in sectors more susceptible to the pandemic and continue to monitor those exposures closely. To provide transparency into these exposures, we have enhanced our Form 10-Q disclosures.  We also have a 13% allocation to performance-based investments and public equity securities, down from 18% at year-end 2019, which backed long-dated liabilities and capital. As you can see in the chart at the bottom right, in February, we reduced our equity exposure by $4 billion, primarily through the sale of public equity securities with proceeds invested in high-quality fixed income. These trades were executed at an average price equivalent of 3,281 on the S&P 500 compared to the March month end level of 2,585. We continue to proactively employ a disciplined risk and return framework to the portfolio as economic conditions evolve.  Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review results for the Life, Benefits and Annuities segment. Allstate Life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $80 million in the first quarter, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by lower operating costs and expenses. Allstate Benefits' adjusted net income of $24 million in the first quarter was $7 million below the prior year quarter. The decline was due to higher operating costs and expenses, driven by increased investments in technology and higher DAC amortization. Allstate Annuities, shown on the bottom right, had an adjusted net loss of $139 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the performance-based investment results we discussed earlier.  Coronavirus claims did not appear to materially impact any of these businesses in the first quarter, though we continue to monitor developments closely.  Now let's turn to Slide 9 to talk about our Service Businesses. The Service Businesses continued to increase the number of customers protected with policy in-force growth of 35.4% to $113.7 million. This is largely due to the increase in Allstate Protection Plans. Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, grew 18.2% to $454 million in the first quarter. Adjusted net income improved to $37 million in the first quarter, reflecting an increase of $26 million compared to the first quarter of 2019, driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services.  Slide 10 highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. While the impact of the coronavirus drove financial market instability and led to a decline in shareholders' equity, Allstate's diversified business model, substantial earnings capacity and strong capital and liquidity enables us to manage effectively through this pandemic. We have $3.4 billion in parent company holding deployable assets and $8.8 billion of highly liquid securities saleable within 1 week. We continued to generate strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 18.2% as of the end of the first quarter while returning $670 million to common shareholders in the quarter through a combination of $511 million in share repurchases and $159 million in common stock dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases under our current $3 billion program, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.  And now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the coronavirus impact on auto insurance and how we're leveraging data and insights to make decisions.\nGlenn Shapiro: Thanks, Mario, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 11, which looks at the potential impacts of coronavirus on auto insurance. Profit has been, and will be, impacted by a reduction in miles driven, which will lower overall loss costs. While this has been significant, it will decline over time as the economy begins to reopen, and there are several offsets.  First, the reduction of drivers on the road has increased driving speeds, which can lead to increased severity per claim. We'll also likely incur additional bad debt from some customers who have chosen to take extended payment terms. On a longer-term basis, if the global auto parts supply chain is disrupted or parts prices are raised by auto manufacturers, this could increase repair costs. The pandemic and economic slowdown will also impact growth. If loss costs continue to be below prior year, the lower required rate increases will limit average premium growth.  On the positive side, the Shelter-in-Place payment could have a favorable impact on retention. The impact on new business is unclear since reduced vehicle sales can lower new business, but economic conditions may increase shopping levels. And we've seen an increased customer interest in telematics, and we're well positioned with both Drivewise and Milewise, the latter of which charges customers' insurance by mile. Getting ahead of these trends will be important to grow profitably as we continue to manage profitability and competitive position on a market-by-market basis and will enable us to be precise in our responses.  Let's now move to Slide 12. As a customer of Arity, we have access not only to our data, but insights from a much broader data set, some of which is shown on this slide. Telematics-based pricing allows you to factor in things like how much someone drives, where they drive and how they drive. Our telematics products enable us to do that for individual customers, which when combined with a broader set of data, enables us to make better judgments market by market.  For example, based on 3.5 billion trips from February through April, the upper-left graph shows that miles driven declined sharply in mid-March and then began a slow increase since then. You can also see that those states that had stay-at-home orders had a bigger decline in driving. In the upper right, you can see there's also a difference between rural areas at the top of the chart, which declined by about 20%, and urban areas at the bottom, which declined by about 50%. The bottom-left graph shows that while some drivers are not driving at all, those are the bars to the left, about 20% of drivers are actually driving more than they did before mid-March.  Arity also provides a Drivesight score, which is a measure of driving risk. The lower the score, the higher the risk. As you can see on the bottom right, the mean risk has increased despite fewer cars on the road, which correlates to the data that shows some drivers are driving faster. The net of all of this is that Allstate has the data and business processes to proactively adjust to a changing operating environment.  I'll now pass it back to Tom.\nThomas Wilson: Thank you, Glenn. To move to Slide 13, we want to discuss how we've moved past the emergency of moving people to work from home to the immediate of creating a Shelter-in-Place Payback to implementing intermediate-term actions. In this type of environment, you obviously have to look where you step, but you also have to decide where you want to walk. And as we look into the future, there's not that much clarity, right? Who will move back into offices? Will as many people still need to commute to work? What happens to the investment market? And of course, the answer is nobody knows. There are so many possibilities you can get frozen into inaction. So we used scenario planning to see what the future path look like under alternative assumptions.  This came out of Royal Dutch Shell in the '70s, and it works kind of like this. You find 2 things that will be the primary drivers of change. In this case, we selected the length and depth of the health crisis, which is shown at the top of the box on the bottom of that page, and the severity of the economic downturn from disruptive to severe, which is shown on the vertical axis. You then create 4 scenarios to represent a range of possible outcomes.  As you can see from the slide, the best case in the upper right, we've labeled sigh of relief. The health care crisis is over relatively quickly and the economy is disrupted, but government support enables us to bounce back with them. In the worst case, in the lower right, is distracted by the virus. It reflects a significant health impact with repeated lockdowns over the next couple of years. The decline in GDP is greater than the Great Depression, but it doesn't last as long because of the government fiscal monetary action.  For each scenario then, we look at a range of outcomes, including consumer behavior, auto insurance accidents and investment returns. This helps us decide what actions we should do, even though we do not know what the ultimate outcome will be. It also helps inform what not to do. And it enables us to establish road signs for each scenario, which improves our ability to forecast the direction we're headed. There are, of course, similar consequences in the scenarios, which help determine what actions to take, which is shown on Slide 14.  In many of the outcomes, revenue growth is constrained because of fewer auto accidents, deteriorating incomes, increased unemployment or lower interest rates. As a result, we are accelerating our Transformative Growth Plan, which will improve customer value with increased utilization of new technologies, lower costs in new auto insurance products. And as you know well, the investment markets will be more volatile in many of these scenarios.  As a result, we're evaluating our strategic asset allocation. Many of us have found that we can adopt new technologies pretty quickly. Like who knew you can have so many Zoom or Teams or Skype meetings in one day? As a result, we're going to maintain a strong commitment to telematics and expanding the Integrated Digital Enterprise. Consumer behavior is also likely to change to focus on the quality and breadth of their protection. And this is where Allstate is headed, with the second part of our strategy, is to provide a broader array of protection offerings from auto insurance to include things like your phone and your identity.  Now we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question on is -- I think is just on frequency. You guys provided some pretty good disclosure on the drop in miles driven, and I believe you said it started to bounce back from the COVID woes. So as we're thinking about Q2, so April and May kind of to date, how do you think about the frequency benefit that we might see over that period compared to what you saw towards the later stages of March?\nThomas Wilson: Elyse, let me start, and then toss it over to Glenn. Well, it is -- obviously, as people start to drive more, they'll get in more accidents. So we expect that to head up. Where it will end up is hard to predict at this point because you don't really know when people are going to go back to the office and how many people will even go back to the office site.  As I talk to other companies, it's pretty clear to me that we found that we've built the infrastructure to do remote workforce. At Allstate, we've already had about 15% of our people remote before this. We think we can probably do more. So that would obviously lead to fewer people driving to and from work, but it's hard to predict exactly where the number comes out. Glenn, do you have anything you want to add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Not too much. I think, Tom -- as Tom said, you've got some unknowns in there, which would include, if you go on the other side of it, some pent-up demand. If you think about people who postponed trips, who postponed visiting relatives and want to catch up on it, so you could have some sort of fits and starts with some of the long-lasting, as Tom described, downward pressure on driving and, therefore, frequency, but also some potential short-term bubbles where people want to get out there because they're a little bit stir-crazy.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is on buybacks. I know you guys have said you expect to maintain your buyback program. So as we think about the completion of that program, I believe it runs through the end of 2021, should we think about kind of an even pace of buybacks from here? Would there be some slowdown over the next couple of quarters? Or just given the capital position, you kind of expect that to be evenly maintained as we work our way through 2021?\nThomas Wilson: Mario, will you take that question?\nMario Rizzo: Sure. Elyse, thanks for the questions. So I think the place I'd start, Elyse, is we feel really good about our capital and liquidity position, $3.4 billion of holding company assets, $8.8 billion of readily available liquidity, $3.7 billion of dividend capacity out of our insurance companies into the holding company for the year. And our businesses are performing really well. So I think I'd say we expect to complete the program by the end of next year just like our Board authorized. And we've got a lot of flexibility in terms of how we execute it, but we would expect to just continue to buy back shares over that time period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: First question will be on the expense ratio, the underlying expense ratio improvement. Can you talk about what -- and you provided just a basic comment on it in your prepared remarks. Can you give us more color on that? And maybe talk about maybe how that fits with the sequential decline in Allstate Agency's LSPs? And is that part of your integrated services platform rollout?\nThomas Wilson: Mario, why don't you take expenses? And Glenn, will you take the agent?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, sure. So when you look at the expense ratio in the quarter, you saw a 1 point sequential decline year-over-year in the expense ratio. And first thing I'd say is, reducing our cost continues to be a core part of our transformative growth strategy. And when you kind of deconstruct where the improvement came from, it's about 50-50, not quite between acquisition costs and operating costs.  And obviously, those are two core parts of our cost structure, and we saw improvement in both. And we're going to continue to be focused on reducing those costs going forward to enhance our competitive position to still take growth and be a core part of transformative growth for us.  We're also going to continue to invest in the things we need to invest in for transformative growth, things like technology and marketing. But we're focused going forward on continuing to reduce costs over time. I'll turn it over to Glenn to talk a little bit about the agency part of it.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. Greg, thanks for the question. In terms of the LSP count and agent count, you hit on part of it in your question with integrated service. When you look at licensed sales professionals, and in spite of the word sales being the operative word there, they spend only about 40% of their time on sales, about 60% on service. That's been a historic number.  And one of the things we're committed to is taking a lot of the transactional work out, both through self-service capabilities as well as integrated service, over time, so that they're increasing that percentage of time they're selling and not having to do as much of that transactional work. So we'll probably see that change over time. And that's really part of our overall transformative growth work that we're doing.  And in terms of the agency count, we're really focused on growth and growing with quality in terms of the agency force. So coming into this year, I think everybody knew we changed compensation a little bit, where we moved variable compensation from renewal to new, part of it. And we also increased expectations for production on our agency force because we really want to grow with those agents that are looking to invest and grow in their business.\nCharles Peters: The next -- my follow-up question is on the investment portfolio. First of all, as an observer, I have to acknowledge the brilliance of your decision to sell the public equities in February. It's stunning. But as I look at the adjustments you made to the limited partnerships, do you think that this is a permanent change to your valuation approach on a quarterly basis? Or -- and I guess the other adjacent question was -- would be that in your adjustments to the first quarter results on LPs, did it include an assessment for all of the LPs or 100% of the portfolio? Or what percentage of the portfolio wasn't covered by your valuation reassessments?\nThomas Wilson: Greg, thank you for the comment on equity. I just want to be clear. It was done on a risk and return basis. So we just looked at the capital up on it. We looked at the prospective outlook, and we decided that wasn't as good a return on those -- on the amount of capital we had to have up on equity.  We obviously -- it was good timing, but it wasn't like we knew the market crash was coming. But it also shows the benefit of having business processes that are metric driven that you stick to them, whether that's the way you invest or what Glenn was talking about in terms of how our business processes and our metrics were for changing frequency by state and doing pricing by state. Mario, will you take the question on accounting on this performance-based investment?\nMario Rizzo: Sure. So Greg, I guess where I'd start is, as we've said in the past, generally, we record performance-based income on a 1-quarter lag based on the partner financial statements as of the prior quarter end. So for example, in the first quarter, we would have relied on year-end partner financial statements. And that's typically how we would approach the accounting.  However, our accounting policy does require that when a material market event occurs, and we have information available to make informed estimates, that we need to take that information into account. And that's what we did this quarter. So we made the two adjustments, the -- marking the public equity holdings in some of the partnership holdings to March 31 levels, and then suppressing the increases in unrealized valuation on securities that were reflected in the year-end financial statement. We did that because that's part of the accounting policy because there was a material market event in the quarter.  The other piece was the -- just our normal watchlist process where we go through every holding. And to the extent we believe we need to impair a holding, we do that. And that was worth $137 million in the quarter on four specific holdings. So absent another market disruption event, let's say, hopefully, we avoid one this quarter, we'll go back to what our typical process would be. But because there was this disruption event in the first quarter, our policy required that if we had additional information that we could make good estimates based on, we should do that. And that's exactly what we did.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.\nJon Newsome: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about or give us some color on where the acceleration will come in the Transformative Growth Plan. What will change? You mentioned you're thinking of accelerating it.\nThomas Wilson: Thanks, Paul. Obviously, it's a multifaceted program, right? The idea is to increase customer access. And that was putting together the -- using the Esurance capabilities on direct under the Allstate brand to expand there. It's to reduce our cost structure, and it's to use technology to enable us to launch new products and lower our cost structure. So the -- Glenn can talk about the progress on Esurance and the Allstate brand, and that's been great. And we're headed down the path to have start operating under the Allstate brand on a direct basis this year.  On the cost reduction, it will accelerate some of the stuff we do on cost reduction, and it will also accelerate some of the work we're doing on building new technologies, particularly as it looks things like Milewise and Drivewise. Before, when you sold insurance by the mile, we're, I think, one of the few large companies that do that. The people didn't really know what it's about today with Shelter-in-Place Payback from us or the actions of our competitors. People are paying attention now and saying, \"Oh, maybe I do want to pay by the mile.\" So we will push harder on the new product efforts as well.  Glenn, do you want to pick up the Esurance and Allstate brand part? And maybe talk as well about the Esurance growth in the first quarter since that may be on people's mind as it relates to transformative growth.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So I'll start with the Esurance growth piece, and then I'll go into the -- what we're doing as far as the transformation. Because really transformative growth and the brand changes had nothing to do with the growth in the first quarter. It was actually a 3-part story. Esurance was having increased loss trends in the latter part of last year. We needed to take some pricing and underwriting actions. We did, which is good, because we've gotten the profitability in line as a result. But what typically happens with that is you take a little bit of a hit on your retention and your new business as that happens. And that was happening towards the very end of the year and into January.  Now once those prices have worked their way through, we actually reinvested some marketing. We were doing pretty well in February and early March when quoting kind of fell off the table in the middle of March. So you have these sort of 3 windows to like a slow start in January, some really nice momentum in February, early March, and then everything fell off the table there for a few weeks.  Fortunately, as we've seen from external indices, shopping has returned and is expected to actually accelerate going forward. So we've got some good optimism there as to how it moves forward in terms of Esurance growth.  In terms of transformative growth and where we're going, Jonathan Adkisson, who's the President of Esurance and took over now as our head of the direct business, has been working with both teams and bringing it together in such a way that we increase or improve our sales process under the Allstate brand. We improve our online quote flow. And so those are already in process and happening on a day-by-day basis. It's a continuous improvement effort. What is still to come is our pivot on branding and how we invest in marketing for the Allstate brand to go to market as both a direct and agency-driven brand as well as our work with online leads.\nJon Newsome: Somewhat relatedly, could you talk a little bit about what happened with retention? Did it also have a kind of similar 3 different periods like the sales did during the quarter?\nThomas Wilson: Glenn, will you take that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Sure. Retention, I would say no. Retention really -- there's no impact yet from coronavirus because it's kind of a lagging metric. It includes midterm cancellations that you're measuring at the point of when they would have renewed.  So to the extent that we see impact, whether favorable or unfavorable from coronavirus, I think we'll see that on a go-forward basis from a retention standpoint. We still are in a pretty good space from a retention standpoint. We're down year-over-year, but off of a fairly high watermark, still running 88% retention in auto and feel fairly good about where we are. And we continue to work hard to do well for our customers. I think our response to coronavirus and the multiple areas that we were very quick to respond for customers can and, hopefully should, help us from a retention standpoint, and it's something we continue to work at.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore.\nDavid Motemaden: Just a question for Tom on investments. And you mentioned -- just in terms of reducing the equity allocation during the quarter, you mentioned you looked at the return and the capital required and decided to reduce it. I guess are there -- I guess, how are you thinking about the allocation to equities and LPs at 13% of the portfolio going forward? Do you expect to do more of this? And maybe if you could help me understand how much capital that freed up by reducing the $4 billion worth of equities.\nThomas Wilson: Okay, David. Thank you for the growth time question. I'll talk about the logic for the equity. John can then talk about the process we're looking at in terms of going forward, which you talked about at the end is -- which is really your question, where should you invest in this kind of environment? And the answer is we don't know, but we've got a pretty good process, going to figure out what we think is the best option.  First, the equities. A large portion of the equity portfolio back to payout annuities, which are long-dated liabilities, think of them like a pension plan. And so you don't want to be invested in fixed income for annuities that are going to pay out in 10, 20, 30 years. So that's appropriately at the liability match. And that's sort of a bottom. We don't want to move away from that matching because it would be bad long term economically. And you don't want to start to be picking when you trade in or out.  On the other hand, some of our equities just are capital that we use to support the business and that we are a little more flexible with. And we brought down the -- when we look at economic capital, which is amount of capital, we think we need to put up for risk. We thought we had -- it wasn't a good enough return for us. So that was why we reduced it, which is really related to sort of the equity portfolio of the overall entity, not specific asset liability matching.  As it relates to the amount of freed up capital, David, from a statutory capital standpoint, it obviously reduces your capital a little bit. But we're long capital as it is. And so we don't look at it as though we had to free up capital to buy shares back or anything like that. We just look at it pure economics. What's the right thing to do for shareholders on a long-term basis? And it did free up some economic capital, some statutory capital, but it doesn't really make a difference in the amount of capital we have available to either do share repurchases or buy something like that. John, do you want to spend a minute on what we're doing on the strategic asset allocation?\nJohn Dugenske: Yes. Thanks, Tom. And David, thank you for your question. As a regular matter of course, we take a disciplined approach to investing and thoroughly look at the -- managing both the risk and return trade-offs. We do that both directly in the investment department, but then that's highly integrated with the way we think about return and risk opportunities across the firm, as Tom had mentioned.  One of the key things that we do is, first, we have a -- what I believe to be a strong team of about 400 investment professionals and -- that are deeply experienced. And we are in a number of different markets and look at price action, fundamental, economic drivers, technical observations across those markets. We also bring in, on a regular basis, keen insight from people from the outside, whether that's from our dealer relationships, whether that's via specific consultants or economic research teams that we have subscriptions to and try and formulate, at any point in time, the best risk return trade-off for the portfolio, especially given the business lines that we're associated with.  As Tom mentioned, if you -- candidly, if you go back a little more than a year ago, we started to see that the return per unit of risk, as we perceived it in the marketplace, was flattening out, and we became a little bit more concerned about whether investment markets offer the best opportunity. What transpired since then is that the Fed became pretty active last year, as we've all seen. We took that as an opportunity to add duration to the portfolio, which is paying benefits today. So it's tantamount to our desire to be proactive with our investment portfolio and integrate it to the rest of the firm.  As we moved into the end of this year, one of the things that we noticed is that there was a limit to what the central banks could do to continue to push on returns of growth assets or risky assets. We thought that what we had observed in 2019 is not much earnings growth, and there is a fair amount of multiple growth. And we just thought that, that was likely coming into the end. As Tom said, we really didn't predict that there's going to be an event. But the one thing we all recognize as an enterprise that if there was an event, we weren't really giving much compensation for that. So we incorporated this equity trade in February, albeit at very good levels.  The way that we accomplish this on a daily -- on a regular basis and quarterly, we sit down in an investment group and we go through what we call a capital allocation process. And we spend 2, 3 days deeply looking at markets, and then we share that with the rest of the enterprise.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And if I could, just one follow-up. Just on the expense ratio, the 23.4 in the quarter. How should I think about that for the rest of the year, just given potential top line pressure, offset by what sounds like ramp-up of the transformative growth as the year progresses?\nThomas Wilson: Mario, do you want to take that?\nMario Rizzo: Sure. Again, what I'd say is I'd reiterate. Look, a core part of our strategy is to continue to look to take costs out of the system and the general downward view of our expense ratio to improve competitive position.  Having said that, you did say, you articulated a couple of the items that are going to cause some choppiness in that. Number one is the outlook on revenue, which there's uncertainty around that, but also, we're going to continue to make investments in things, like I said, technology and marketing. So I guess what I'd say is, look, our focus is still on reducing costs and driving the expense ratio down over time.  I'm not going to sit here today and give you an exact trajectory of what that's going to look like. But strategically, that continues to be a core part of what we're trying to do.\nThomas Wilson: So what we try to do is manage it down, but not do it stupidly, right? So like, as Glenn mentioned, we have to reposition the Allstate brand to go even more aggressive into driving the direct growth. And that's going to cost some money. So we'll do what we think is economic for shareholders. And then we think if we do it on an upfront, it works out so we achieve our overall objective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.\nJamminder Bhullar: So I had a couple of questions. First, maybe just on the auto business, if you could talk about competition as you're looking at the business through the rest of the year. Everyone's margins are actually obviously pretty strong. Do you see, at some point, companies start to adjust pricing based on sort of whatever the new normal is in terms of driving behavior? And have you seen any indication of companies getting a little bit looser on renewal terms recently?\nThomas Wilson: Let me start, maybe talk about process, Jimmy, and Glenn can fill in some specific thoughts he has. So it's -- obviously, we did the Shelter-in-Place Payback, and everybody followed relatively quickly. That doesn't mean that we really only have the idea. It just means that everybody thought that with margins where they were, it was fair to give it back to customers or at least that was our view.  And whether that people will continue to do that or not, it's hard to tell. What I do know is that because we have a business model which is run by market, by line, by coverage, with all kinds of data, both our telematics data, our own historical data, our claim data and the information we get from Arity, will be incredibly precise and surgical about the way we react. I can't speak to what other people do.  Glenn, is there anything in the competitive environment that is clearer today than -- and has been kind of murky, is I would say. But anything you would add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. What I would say is we're clearly going to be in a very benign rate environment. That might be an understatement, and -- for some period of time. What I haven't seen is, in the competitive environment, anybody making a more durable or permanent change to their premiums, meaning a rate reduction that is over a permanent price filing for rate reduction. Because I think, like us, I'm sure others see that like this came on fast. Like I don't think anybody predicted that when we came into this year, we were going to have an event that would drive mileage down by 50% or whatever the numbers are by state. And it can go away fast, too.  So I think everybody's looking at this, I know we are, from the standpoint of how do we react in real time, make good decisions, doing the right thing by market with precision, as Tom said, with our customers in mind, but not do anything that we then have to rebound on. And it wouldn't be good for anybody to overplay it a hand and then have to go take rate increases afterwards. So I think what you're going to see is a very benign, flat rate environment as opposed to a negative one.\nJamminder Bhullar: And then on the sales or top line growth environment in sort of the Services, Benefits or Life businesses, should we assume that because the COVID and sort of Shelter-in-Place, that you'll see a drop-off in sales in some of these businesses in the near term?\nThomas Wilson: Let me have Don answer about the Services Business, particularly Allstate Protection plans, which, as you saw, is just continuing to grow incredibly rapidly. And I hate for that story to get lost amongst the coronavirus part. And then I would just -- I think I could summarize it to say, in Life, that we haven't had much growth there in the last couple of years, and we're really trying to still reboot that growth strategy. Don, do you want to...\nDogan Civgin: Sure. So I think, obviously, each of the businesses are going to be impacted by different trends. Some of them will be driven by frequency such as our roadside business. Some will be driven by auto sales and kind of general economic conditions like a dealer services and so forth. So I think every business will be impacted by some different factors. Allstate Protection Plans, which has continued to have terrific growth, first, on a broader level, they've been growing for a number of quarters. So this is not unique to the first quarter of 2020. And so we've been really pleased with the overall growth and overall improvement in profitability that they've been able to exhibit.  Now when you look at the first quarter, you might look and say, \"Well, their -- most of their sales are through retail.\" And retail is suffering, which is maybe true in general, but you have to get a little bit more nuanced and look at the types of customers they have, the types of retailers we do business with and, to some extent, what's being purchased at retail right now.  So when you look at SquareTrade's kind of largest B2B customers, they tend to be the larger one-stop shops, where people have been going to shop more frequently since coronavirus hit because they want to get all of their purchases done with one stop if they can do so. Second, a lot of what's been purchased, as people have been adapting to the home environment, has been kind of getting home offices set up, to some extent, entertainment setup because they're going to be stuck in their houses for some period of time, which obviously come with the opportunity for extended warranties as well as the stimulus check impact which put funds in people's pockets to be able to then go out and spend. So when you look at what their particular type of customer was looking for, the first quarter after coronavirus saw a nice increase.  It's hard to tell whether that will last and how long that will last. I think at some point, the overall trends in retail will be a headwind for Allstate Protection Plans. But at least in the short term, it's actually been a nice tailwind. I would also say that new business, which they've picked up a number of large accounts recently, both domestically and overseas, rollouts of those programs have slowed down a little bit as people have been trying to figure out how they're going to get those stores open. And there was a slight, I would say in the first quarter, benefit from claims dip as people submitted fewer claims after the virus hit for some period of time.  So overall, trends continue to be really strong. Hard to tell what the impact is going to be on Allstate Protection Plans long term from the virus. But in kind of the immediate term, it's been good for their top line.\nJamminder Bhullar: Okay. And just lastly, any comments you have on long-term strategy for the annuity block and the likelihood of a sale or reinsurance of that business?\nThomas Wilson: Sure. Let me jump at that, Jimmy. First, on the -- I should also point out on more longitudinal perspective, Allstate Protection Plans now has over 100 million policies in force. Don, I think it was about 30-plus million when we bought it, right? 30 million plus.\nDogan Civgin: Yes.\nThomas Wilson: So it's had a tremendous run not to be swept under the carpet. It's really a great team. As it relates to annuities, it's a huge drag on our ROE because we -- as I mentioned earlier, we have a lot of equities behind that portfolio because we believe that's the right thing to do. So our 18.2% includes a large drag on it from the annuities. If we could find a way to eliminate that drag, we would do so. But we only want to do it with some place where our customers will be well taken care of because this is largely written on our paper. And we don't want to give somebody a whole bunch of investments and say, \"Good luck, and we hope you pay the people off when you get there.\" And they do something stupid.  So we are managing it well as it is today. Either we will find a solution, that could be a reinsurance solution, it could be a sale, it could be we just keep it, we run it differently. In any event, it will go away in terms of its drag on ROE when the new long-dated accounting -- long-dated annuity accounting comes in place where you'll have to mark that to market. We don't -- we think that, that accounting is a little rough. On the other end, it will eliminate the drag on overall ROE.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nCharles Lederer: This is actually Charlie on for Mike. Can you talk about your commercial lines exposures outside of commercial auto? And specifically, can you talk about business interruption exposure in general, whether you've seen claims and if your policies have virus exclusions?\nThomas Wilson: Don, in your report?\nDogan Civgin: Okay. Charlie, so in our business insurance, we do actually have exclusions for disruption caused by the pandemic and so we -- like many others do. And so there's a lot of noise out there about implementing requirements for insurance companies to go back and provide coverages that were not only excluded explicitly, but were also not priced for.  And so we would be against obviously that. Having said that, our exposure is relatively small. There's about 60,000 policies in total that we have that sort of exposure, which as I said, is explicitly excluded. So it's a relatively small number for a company like Allstate.\nCharles Lederer: Got it. And then on the Shelter-in-Place Payback included in the expense ratio in the first quarter, does that imply the charge for the second quarter will be the balance to get to the $600 million you guys have talked about? And is there a potential for further premium reductions, either larger discounts per month or an extension of the duration of the discounts?\nThomas Wilson: Mario, if you'll take the second -- the first piece and then make sure we talk about all the other things, whether it's bad debts or anything else coming up in the quarter. As it -- Charlie, as it relates to another Shelter-in-Place program, what we said is we're always going to treat our customers fairly. This came along quickly. We moved within 10 days to get people what was a relatively easier to implement in terms of it ubiquitous across the country, ubiquitous by customer. Everybody got 15% in April and May. And we felt we needed to do that because they were all struggling. The government money had not yet come into people's home. So we even provided the opportunity for them to get cash, even though they might have gone on a deferred payment plan with us.  And so that was -- it was done because we need -- knew our customers needed help, and we need to do it fast. If frequency were to stay down because of something that was not continuous, so we thought it was Shelter-in-Place for a longer period of time, those graphs that Glenn showed. If it stayed down there, we may want to do something else for our customers to reflect the fact that they're not driving as much. This time though, it will be much more precise. And so we'll use all the data we have to -- as Glenn talked about, some people are driving more, but it doesn't feel like they should get a Shelter-in-Place Payback, right? It doesn't seem as fair to somebody who's not driving their car at all. The same thing about which area you live in, you live in an urban area or rural area. Is your -- what kind of driving? Are you a really fast driver? Now not everybody's on telematics, so we can't get it as precise as we would like. But we are working on a more comprehensive approach should frequency stay down, and we will do what we think is fair for our customers. Mario, do you want to take the second quarter impact from what we've already done?\nMario Rizzo: Sure. So on -- with respect to the SIPP payment, we saw we recorded a portion of it in the first quarter. The balance will be recorded in the second quarter. So that one's pretty straightforward. That will happen. When we kind of decided on the SIPP payment, one of the things we explicitly factored in was the potential for bad debt expense associated with the special payment plan that we're allowing our customers to opt into. As we evaluated the number of customers that had opted into that as of the end of March, along with our historical bad debt experience, the impact in the first quarter from a bad debt perspective was pretty immaterial. Obviously, we will look at the number of customers that have signed up as well as the exposure going forward. And we'll take that into account in the second quarter in terms of establishing bad debt prospectively. But first quarter was reasonably immaterial. Second quarter, we'll take a look at the analysis. We'll update it appropriately, and then we'll record something incremental in the second quarter.\nOperator: Our final question then for today comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.\nYaron Kinar: Just want to go back to distribution a little bit. Can you maybe talk about how the agency channel is impacted by Shelter-in-Place environment and the -- with customers potentially looking for lower price options as well? And with that, maybe also touch on kind of the timing of shifting the agent variable compensation to a -- more to a new business generation and how that has been impacting the sales force.\nThomas Wilson: Glenn will be the best person to answer that question.\nGlenn Shapiro: All right. Thanks, Yaron. First of all, when you think about the impacts of coronavirus, I think it's important, there's all different types of businesses that have to close down all the way up through businesses that actually benefit because they're in the type of business that wins in this type of new environment. The agents kind of fall in the middle of that because if you think about their revenue stream, it is still significantly renewal compensation. Our total compensation to the agency force, and if you break down to any individual agent, will range somewhere between 90% and 100% or, in some cases, even above 100%. Some are growing more post middle of March versus before. So the core of their income remains. So you've got that piece.  In terms of how it impacts their business, I think that, that will be something to watch and something to see. I agree that people will be looking for value as they go forward. But I also think our agents have really been able to show their value in this process. I don't think there's another time in our company history where I could make the following statement. Over the course of the last 6 weeks, almost all of our agents have called almost all of their customers. So you've got this really unique period of time where, a, people are more available to be reached; b, they have more questions, and they really want to hear from their trusted adviser; and c, our folks are just committed to that because of a national crisis.  And so I think that there's this moment in time where at least some portion of our customer base will really see the value of what they've gotten out of their agency relationship and having a trusted adviser. That said, everything Mario and Tom and others have talked about on this call about transformative growth is, we've got to keep taking costs out of our system and be a more affordable and more competitive value for consumers going forward, which is why we're accelerating the Transformative Growth Plan.\nYaron Kinar: Got it and understood. And then maybe one quick follow-up. Milewise, you talked about potentially accelerating it. I think as of year-end, you were in 14 states. Any thoughts as to how quickly you can really expand the program to all 50 states?\nThomas Wilson: Glenn, do you want to give an update on that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So we're in 16 states and moving as quickly as we can on it. Certainly, the pandemic has shown a light on the value of a pay-per-mile product, and we're seeing a nice uptick in the demand for it. You see kind of 2 effects in the public right now. One is just the acceptance of the notion that telematics is going up as a result of all of this, and two is actually the over-demand for something like Milewise is going up. We have some states up 30% in terms of their sales since the middle of March and seeing double-digit percentages regularly on a week-by-week basis of the new business being sold in Milewise versus other products. So we think it's a great opportunity. It will absolutely be part of our filings that we're doing broadly across the country to try to expand and do more for consumers as a result of the pandemic.\nThomas Wilson: Okay. Thank you all. Allstate is in a strong position. We know how to protect our customers from life's uncertainties, and we'll continue to do that as we navigate through this crisis. So thank you for participating, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Thomas Wilson",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining us from wherever you are sheltered in place. Let's jump right in with Allstate's response to the coronavirus pandemic on Slide 2.  Allstate has been helping customers overcome catastrophes for 89 years, and we've learned to act decisively, quickly and put customers first. As a result, we've led the industry in helping customers. We created a Shelter-in-Place Payback program of more than $600 million. Special payment plans are being used for customers experiencing financial challenges. Auto insurance coverage was expanded to cover the use of personal vehicles to deliver food, medicine and other goods for commercial purposes. Allstate Identity Protection is being offered for free for the rest of the year to all U.S. residents, given the increased exposure to cybercrime.  Business continuity plans were executed. Virtual sales and support capabilities were expanded. We leveraged our digital innovations, such as QuickFoto Claim and Virtual Assist, to better protect our customers, employees and agents.  Employees and Allstate agents moved to more than 95% working remotely, and we altered a number of business practices to support our agents and employees. At the same time, Allstate is financially strong with significant capital and liquidity. In February, we reduced our public equity holdings by $4 billion to reduce the amount of economic capital back in the investment portfolio. But this turned out to be good timing because it enabled us to reduce the impact of the market downturn in March. And as Mario will cover later, we will maintain our share repurchase program given the strong capital position.  For our communities, the Allstate Foundation announced an additional $5 million. That's on top of the money we normally grant every year, which is substantial to help deal with the pandemic and double demand for Allstate employees' need. Move to Slide 3. Let's touch base with Allstate's strategy. As you know, our strategy has two components: increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand into other protection businesses. This 2-part strategy leads to our 5 annual operating priorities, which is shown on the right side of this page, and we made good progress around all five.  If you move to Slide 4, Allstate had strong operating and financial results in the first quarter. Total revenues of $10.1 billion declined 8.3% for the prior year quarter due to capital losses instead of capital gains in the prior year. If you exclude the impact of the realized capital losses, revenues increased 2%, driven by a 4.4% increase in Property-Liability insurance premiums, which you can see from the table.  Net income of $513 million declined to the prior year quarter's increased underwriting income, was more than offset by capital losses and charges for pension and postretirement benefits. Adjusted net income, shown in the middle of the table, was $1.1 billion in the quarter or $3.54 per diluted share, which was significantly above the prior year, reflecting lower catastrophe losses. Returns were excellent with adjusted net income return on equity improving to 18.2%.  Mario will now discuss the first quarter results in more detail. Thank you, Glenn. To move to Slide 13, we want to discuss how we've moved past the emergency of moving people to work from home to the immediate of creating a Shelter-in-Place Payback to implementing intermediate-term actions. In this type of environment, you obviously have to look where you step, but you also have to decide where you want to walk. And as we look into the future, there's not that much clarity, right? Who will move back into offices? Will as many people still need to commute to work? What happens to the investment market? And of course, the answer is nobody knows. There are so many possibilities you can get frozen into inaction. So we used scenario planning to see what the future path look like under alternative assumptions.  This came out of Royal Dutch Shell in the '70s, and it works kind of like this. You find 2 things that will be the primary drivers of change. In this case, we selected the length and depth of the health crisis, which is shown at the top of the box on the bottom of that page, and the severity of the economic downturn from disruptive to severe, which is shown on the vertical axis. You then create 4 scenarios to represent a range of possible outcomes.  As you can see from the slide, the best case in the upper right, we've labeled sigh of relief. The health care crisis is over relatively quickly and the economy is disrupted, but government support enables us to bounce back with them. In the worst case, in the lower right, is distracted by the virus. It reflects a significant health impact with repeated lockdowns over the next couple of years. The decline in GDP is greater than the Great Depression, but it doesn't last as long because of the government fiscal monetary action.  For each scenario then, we look at a range of outcomes, including consumer behavior, auto insurance accidents and investment returns. This helps us decide what actions we should do, even though we do not know what the ultimate outcome will be. It also helps inform what not to do. And it enables us to establish road signs for each scenario, which improves our ability to forecast the direction we're headed. There are, of course, similar consequences in the scenarios, which help determine what actions to take, which is shown on Slide 14.  In many of the outcomes, revenue growth is constrained because of fewer auto accidents, deteriorating incomes, increased unemployment or lower interest rates. As a result, we are accelerating our Transformative Growth Plan, which will improve customer value with increased utilization of new technologies, lower costs in new auto insurance products. And as you know well, the investment markets will be more volatile in many of these scenarios.  As a result, we're evaluating our strategic asset allocation. Many of us have found that we can adopt new technologies pretty quickly. Like who knew you can have so many Zoom or Teams or Skype meetings in one day? As a result, we're going to maintain a strong commitment to telematics and expanding the Integrated Digital Enterprise. Consumer behavior is also likely to change to focus on the quality and breadth of their protection. And this is where Allstate is headed, with the second part of our strategy, is to provide a broader array of protection offerings from auto insurance to include things like your phone and your identity.  Now we'll open the line for questions. Elyse, let me start, and then toss it over to Glenn. Well, it is -- obviously, as people start to drive more, they'll get in more accidents. So we expect that to head up. Where it will end up is hard to predict at this point because you don't really know when people are going to go back to the office and how many people will even go back to the office site.  As I talk to other companies, it's pretty clear to me that we found that we've built the infrastructure to do remote workforce. At Allstate, we've already had about 15% of our people remote before this. We think we can probably do more. So that would obviously lead to fewer people driving to and from work, but it's hard to predict exactly where the number comes out. Glenn, do you have anything you want to add to that? Mario, will you take that question? Mario, why don't you take expenses? And Glenn, will you take the agent? Greg, thank you for the comment on equity. I just want to be clear. It was done on a risk and return basis. So we just looked at the capital up on it. We looked at the prospective outlook, and we decided that wasn't as good a return on those -- on the amount of capital we had to have up on equity.  We obviously -- it was good timing, but it wasn't like we knew the market crash was coming. But it also shows the benefit of having business processes that are metric driven that you stick to them, whether that's the way you invest or what Glenn was talking about in terms of how our business processes and our metrics were for changing frequency by state and doing pricing by state. Mario, will you take the question on accounting on this performance-based investment? Thanks, Paul. Obviously, it's a multifaceted program, right? The idea is to increase customer access. And that was putting together the -- using the Esurance capabilities on direct under the Allstate brand to expand there. It's to reduce our cost structure, and it's to use technology to enable us to launch new products and lower our cost structure. So the -- Glenn can talk about the progress on Esurance and the Allstate brand, and that's been great. And we're headed down the path to have start operating under the Allstate brand on a direct basis this year.  On the cost reduction, it will accelerate some of the stuff we do on cost reduction, and it will also accelerate some of the work we're doing on building new technologies, particularly as it looks things like Milewise and Drivewise. Before, when you sold insurance by the mile, we're, I think, one of the few large companies that do that. The people didn't really know what it's about today with Shelter-in-Place Payback from us or the actions of our competitors. People are paying attention now and saying, \"Oh, maybe I do want to pay by the mile.\" So we will push harder on the new product efforts as well.  Glenn, do you want to pick up the Esurance and Allstate brand part? And maybe talk as well about the Esurance growth in the first quarter since that may be on people's mind as it relates to transformative growth. Glenn, will you take that? Okay, David. Thank you for the growth time question. I'll talk about the logic for the equity. John can then talk about the process we're looking at in terms of going forward, which you talked about at the end is -- which is really your question, where should you invest in this kind of environment? And the answer is we don't know, but we've got a pretty good process, going to figure out what we think is the best option.  First, the equities. A large portion of the equity portfolio back to payout annuities, which are long-dated liabilities, think of them like a pension plan. And so you don't want to be invested in fixed income for annuities that are going to pay out in 10, 20, 30 years. So that's appropriately at the liability match. And that's sort of a bottom. We don't want to move away from that matching because it would be bad long term economically. And you don't want to start to be picking when you trade in or out.  On the other hand, some of our equities just are capital that we use to support the business and that we are a little more flexible with. And we brought down the -- when we look at economic capital, which is amount of capital, we think we need to put up for risk. We thought we had -- it wasn't a good enough return for us. So that was why we reduced it, which is really related to sort of the equity portfolio of the overall entity, not specific asset liability matching.  As it relates to the amount of freed up capital, David, from a statutory capital standpoint, it obviously reduces your capital a little bit. But we're long capital as it is. And so we don't look at it as though we had to free up capital to buy shares back or anything like that. We just look at it pure economics. What's the right thing to do for shareholders on a long-term basis? And it did free up some economic capital, some statutory capital, but it doesn't really make a difference in the amount of capital we have available to either do share repurchases or buy something like that. John, do you want to spend a minute on what we're doing on the strategic asset allocation? Mario, do you want to take that? So what we try to do is manage it down, but not do it stupidly, right? So like, as Glenn mentioned, we have to reposition the Allstate brand to go even more aggressive into driving the direct growth. And that's going to cost some money. So we'll do what we think is economic for shareholders. And then we think if we do it on an upfront, it works out so we achieve our overall objective. Let me start, maybe talk about process, Jimmy, and Glenn can fill in some specific thoughts he has. So it's -- obviously, we did the Shelter-in-Place Payback, and everybody followed relatively quickly. That doesn't mean that we really only have the idea. It just means that everybody thought that with margins where they were, it was fair to give it back to customers or at least that was our view.  And whether that people will continue to do that or not, it's hard to tell. What I do know is that because we have a business model which is run by market, by line, by coverage, with all kinds of data, both our telematics data, our own historical data, our claim data and the information we get from Arity, will be incredibly precise and surgical about the way we react. I can't speak to what other people do.  Glenn, is there anything in the competitive environment that is clearer today than -- and has been kind of murky, is I would say. But anything you would add to that? Let me have Don answer about the Services Business, particularly Allstate Protection plans, which, as you saw, is just continuing to grow incredibly rapidly. And I hate for that story to get lost amongst the coronavirus part. And then I would just -- I think I could summarize it to say, in Life, that we haven't had much growth there in the last couple of years, and we're really trying to still reboot that growth strategy. Don, do you want to... Sure. Let me jump at that, Jimmy. First, on the -- I should also point out on more longitudinal perspective, Allstate Protection Plans now has over 100 million policies in force. Don, I think it was about 30-plus million when we bought it, right? 30 million plus. So it's had a tremendous run not to be swept under the carpet. It's really a great team. As it relates to annuities, it's a huge drag on our ROE because we -- as I mentioned earlier, we have a lot of equities behind that portfolio because we believe that's the right thing to do. So our 18.2% includes a large drag on it from the annuities. If we could find a way to eliminate that drag, we would do so. But we only want to do it with some place where our customers will be well taken care of because this is largely written on our paper. And we don't want to give somebody a whole bunch of investments and say, \"Good luck, and we hope you pay the people off when you get there.\" And they do something stupid.  So we are managing it well as it is today. Either we will find a solution, that could be a reinsurance solution, it could be a sale, it could be we just keep it, we run it differently. In any event, it will go away in terms of its drag on ROE when the new long-dated accounting -- long-dated annuity accounting comes in place where you'll have to mark that to market. We don't -- we think that, that accounting is a little rough. On the other end, it will eliminate the drag on overall ROE. Don, in your report? Mario, if you'll take the second -- the first piece and then make sure we talk about all the other things, whether it's bad debts or anything else coming up in the quarter. As it -- Charlie, as it relates to another Shelter-in-Place program, what we said is we're always going to treat our customers fairly. This came along quickly. We moved within 10 days to get people what was a relatively easier to implement in terms of it ubiquitous across the country, ubiquitous by customer. Everybody got 15% in April and May. And we felt we needed to do that because they were all struggling. The government money had not yet come into people's home. So we even provided the opportunity for them to get cash, even though they might have gone on a deferred payment plan with us.

It doesn't seem as fair to somebody who's not driving their car at all. The same thing about which area you live in, you live in an urban area or rural area. Is your -- what kind of driving? Are you a really fast driver? Now not everybody's on telematics, so we can't get it as precise as we would like. But we are working on a more comprehensive approach should frequency stay down, and we will do what we think is fair for our customers. Mario, do you want to take the second quarter impact from what we've already done? Glenn will be the best person to answer that question. Glenn, do you want to give an update on that? Okay. Thank you all. Allstate is in a strong position. We know how to protect our customers from life's uncertainties, and we'll continue to do that as we navigate through this crisis. So thank you for participating, and we'll talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Glenn Shapiro",
            "content": "Thanks, Mario, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 11, which looks at the potential impacts of coronavirus on auto insurance. Profit has been, and will be, impacted by a reduction in miles driven, which will lower overall loss costs. While this has been significant, it will decline over time as the economy begins to reopen, and there are several offsets.  First, the reduction of drivers on the road has increased driving speeds, which can lead to increased severity per claim. We'll also likely incur additional bad debt from some customers who have chosen to take extended payment terms. On a longer-term basis, if the global auto parts supply chain is disrupted or parts prices are raised by auto manufacturers, this could increase repair costs. The pandemic and economic slowdown will also impact growth. If loss costs continue to be below prior year, the lower required rate increases will limit average premium growth.  On the positive side, the Shelter-in-Place payment could have a favorable impact on retention. The impact on new business is unclear since reduced vehicle sales can lower new business, but economic conditions may increase shopping levels. And we've seen an increased customer interest in telematics, and we're well positioned with both Drivewise and Milewise, the latter of which charges customers' insurance by mile. Getting ahead of these trends will be important to grow profitably as we continue to manage profitability and competitive position on a market-by-market basis and will enable us to be precise in our responses.  Let's now move to Slide 12. As a customer of Arity, we have access not only to our data, but insights from a much broader data set, some of which is shown on this slide. Telematics-based pricing allows you to factor in things like how much someone drives, where they drive and how they drive. Our telematics products enable us to do that for individual customers, which when combined with a broader set of data, enables us to make better judgments market by market.  For example, based on 3.5 billion trips from February through April, the upper-left graph shows that miles driven declined sharply in mid-March and then began a slow increase since then. You can also see that those states that had stay-at-home orders had a bigger decline in driving. In the upper right, you can see there's also a difference between rural areas at the top of the chart, which declined by about 20%, and urban areas at the bottom, which declined by about 50%. The bottom-left graph shows that while some drivers are not driving at all, those are the bars to the left, about 20% of drivers are actually driving more than they did before mid-March.  Arity also provides a Drivesight score, which is a measure of driving risk. The lower the score, the higher the risk. As you can see on the bottom right, the mean risk has increased despite fewer cars on the road, which correlates to the data that shows some drivers are driving faster. The net of all of this is that Allstate has the data and business processes to proactively adjust to a changing operating environment.  I'll now pass it back to Tom. Not too much. I think, Tom -- as Tom said, you've got some unknowns in there, which would include, if you go on the other side of it, some pent-up demand. If you think about people who postponed trips, who postponed visiting relatives and want to catch up on it, so you could have some sort of fits and starts with some of the long-lasting, as Tom described, downward pressure on driving and, therefore, frequency, but also some potential short-term bubbles where people want to get out there because they're a little bit stir-crazy. Yes. Greg, thanks for the question. In terms of the LSP count and agent count, you hit on part of it in your question with integrated service. When you look at licensed sales professionals, and in spite of the word sales being the operative word there, they spend only about 40% of their time on sales, about 60% on service. That's been a historic number.  And one of the things we're committed to is taking a lot of the transactional work out, both through self-service capabilities as well as integrated service, over time, so that they're increasing that percentage of time they're selling and not having to do as much of that transactional work. So we'll probably see that change over time. And that's really part of our overall transformative growth work that we're doing.  And in terms of the agency count, we're really focused on growth and growing with quality in terms of the agency force. So coming into this year, I think everybody knew we changed compensation a little bit, where we moved variable compensation from renewal to new, part of it. And we also increased expectations for production on our agency force because we really want to grow with those agents that are looking to invest and grow in their business. Yes. So I'll start with the Esurance growth piece, and then I'll go into the -- what we're doing as far as the transformation. Because really transformative growth and the brand changes had nothing to do with the growth in the first quarter. It was actually a 3-part story. Esurance was having increased loss trends in the latter part of last year. We needed to take some pricing and underwriting actions. We did, which is good, because we've gotten the profitability in line as a result. But what typically happens with that is you take a little bit of a hit on your retention and your new business as that happens. And that was happening towards the very end of the year and into January.  Now once those prices have worked their way through, we actually reinvested some marketing. We were doing pretty well in February and early March when quoting kind of fell off the table in the middle of March. So you have these sort of 3 windows to like a slow start in January, some really nice momentum in February, early March, and then everything fell off the table there for a few weeks.  Fortunately, as we've seen from external indices, shopping has returned and is expected to actually accelerate going forward. So we've got some good optimism there as to how it moves forward in terms of Esurance growth.  In terms of transformative growth and where we're going, Jonathan Adkisson, who's the President of Esurance and took over now as our head of the direct business, has been working with both teams and bringing it together in such a way that we increase or improve our sales process under the Allstate brand. We improve our online quote flow. And so those are already in process and happening on a day-by-day basis. It's a continuous improvement effort. What is still to come is our pivot on branding and how we invest in marketing for the Allstate brand to go to market as both a direct and agency-driven brand as well as our work with online leads. Sure. Retention, I would say no. Retention really -- there's no impact yet from coronavirus because it's kind of a lagging metric. It includes midterm cancellations that you're measuring at the point of when they would have renewed.  So to the extent that we see impact, whether favorable or unfavorable from coronavirus, I think we'll see that on a go-forward basis from a retention standpoint. We still are in a pretty good space from a retention standpoint. We're down year-over-year, but off of a fairly high watermark, still running 88% retention in auto and feel fairly good about where we are. And we continue to work hard to do well for our customers. I think our response to coronavirus and the multiple areas that we were very quick to respond for customers can and, hopefully should, help us from a retention standpoint, and it's something we continue to work at. Yes. What I would say is we're clearly going to be in a very benign rate environment. That might be an understatement, and -- for some period of time. What I haven't seen is, in the competitive environment, anybody making a more durable or permanent change to their premiums, meaning a rate reduction that is over a permanent price filing for rate reduction. Because I think, like us, I'm sure others see that like this came on fast. Like I don't think anybody predicted that when we came into this year, we were going to have an event that would drive mileage down by 50% or whatever the numbers are by state. And it can go away fast, too.  So I think everybody's looking at this, I know we are, from the standpoint of how do we react in real time, make good decisions, doing the right thing by market with precision, as Tom said, with our customers in mind, but not do anything that we then have to rebound on. And it wouldn't be good for anybody to overplay it a hand and then have to go take rate increases afterwards. So I think what you're going to see is a very benign, flat rate environment as opposed to a negative one. All right. Thanks, Yaron. First of all, when you think about the impacts of coronavirus, I think it's important, there's all different types of businesses that have to close down all the way up through businesses that actually benefit because they're in the type of business that wins in this type of new environment. The agents kind of fall in the middle of that because if you think about their revenue stream, it is still significantly renewal compensation. Our total compensation to the agency force, and if you break down to any individual agent, will range somewhere between 90% and 100% or, in some cases, even above 100%. Some are growing more post middle of March versus before. So the core of their income remains. So you've got that piece.  In terms of how it impacts their business, I think that, that will be something to watch and something to see. I agree that people will be looking for value as they go forward. But I also think our agents have really been able to show their value in this process. I don't think there's another time in our company history where I could make the following statement. Over the course of the last 6 weeks, almost all of our agents have called almost all of their customers. So you've got this really unique period of time where, a, people are more available to be reached; b, they have more questions, and they really want to hear from their trusted adviser; and c, our folks are just committed to that because of a national crisis.  And so I think that there's this moment in time where at least some portion of our customer base will really see the value of what they've gotten out of their agency relationship and having a trusted adviser. That said, everything Mario and Tom and others have talked about on this call about transformative growth is, we've got to keep taking costs out of our system and be a more affordable and more competitive value for consumers going forward, which is why we're accelerating the Transformative Growth Plan. Yes. So we're in 16 states and moving as quickly as we can on it. Certainly, the pandemic has shown a light on the value of a pay-per-mile product, and we're seeing a nice uptick in the demand for it. You see kind of 2 effects in the public right now. One is just the acceptance of the notion that telematics is going up as a result of all of this, and two is actually the over-demand for something like Milewise is going up. We have some states up 30% in terms of their sales since the middle of March and seeing double-digit percentages regularly on a week-by-week basis of the new business being sold in Milewise versus other products. So we think it's a great opportunity. It will absolutely be part of our filings that we're doing broadly across the country to try to expand and do more for consumers as a result of the pandemic."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's go to Slide 5 to discuss the strong performance of our Property-Liability segment. Starting with the chart on the left, policy and premium growth continued, with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Underwriting income of $1.35 billion in the first quarter was $645 million higher than the prior year quarter with a combined ratio of 84.9.  The improvement to prior year was driven by several factors, including lower catastrophe losses, increased premiums earned and lower auto accident frequency from the decline in miles driven. Auto accident frequency was significantly lower in the quarter, with property damage gross frequency down 12% compared to the prior year quarter. For the month of March, property damage gross frequency declined 27% compared to the prior year, as miles driven dropped significantly, as states began implementing social distancing measures. These benefits were partially offset by increased severity and the Shelter-in-Place Payback expense.  The chart on the right shows our Property-Liability expense ratio over time and specifically highlights the $210 million Shelter-in-Place Payback expense we recorded in the first quarter, which increased the expense ratio by 2.4 points. Excluding this impact, the expense ratio improved by 1 point compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting continued progress on enhancing the customer value proposition, which is one of the key components of our Transformative Growth Plan.  Let's go to Slide 6, which highlights investment performance for the first quarter. As you'd expect, our first quarter investment portfolio results reflect the impact of the market volatility caused by the coronavirus. As shown in the table in the middle of the page, total return for the first quarter was a negative 2.4%, largely reflecting lower portfolio valuation. While the decline in treasury rates supported fixed income prices, the significant widening of credit spreads more than offset that benefit, and interest-bearing valuation decline reduced return by 1.9%. Lower equity valuations further decreased returns by another 1%.  The chart shows net investment income of $421 million in the quarter, which was $227 million lower than the prior year. We recorded a loss of $208 million for performance-based results in the first quarter, as shown in gray. As you may recall, the income on our limited partnership is typically booked on a 1-quarter lag. Performance-based income related to fourth quarter 2019 sponsored financial statement was $176 million. We also recorded write-downs of $137 million on 4 underperforming private equity investments. In a typical quarter, this is where our process would have ended. However, given market volatility and economic disruption, we also recognized declines in the value of limited partnership interest, where we had enough information to make informed estimates rather than solely relying on sponsored financial statement as of December 31. This included updating publicly traded investments held within limited partnership to their March 31 market pricing, which reduced investment income by $52 million.  We also did not recognize $195 million of unrealized valuation increases reported in sponsor's fourth quarter financial statements. The sum total of these 4 items generated the $208 million performance-based loss in Q1. Because these investments exhibit idiosyncratic risk and return, future gains and losses are uncertain. But we believe utilizing this approach in the quarter is a better indication of current value.  Income from the market-based portfolio, shown in blue, was lower than the prior year quarter by $19 million, reflecting the impact of lower reinvestment rates. We expect this trend to continue to the extent reinvestment rates remain below average interest-bearing portfolio yield.  Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our portfolio positioning. We take a disciplined and proactive approach to managing the investment portfolio risk and return profile, and our positioning has mitigated the impact of the current crisis. As you can see in the chart on the left of the page, the portfolio is largely made up of high-quality fixed income securities with substantial liquidity. We extended the duration of our Property-Liability portfolio last year, which was -- which has supported both income and returns in the lower rate environment. We are conservatively positioned in sectors more susceptible to the pandemic and continue to monitor those exposures closely. To provide transparency into these exposures, we have enhanced our Form 10-Q disclosures.  We also have a 13% allocation to performance-based investments and public equity securities, down from 18% at year-end 2019, which backed long-dated liabilities and capital. As you can see in the chart at the bottom right, in February, we reduced our equity exposure by $4 billion, primarily through the sale of public equity securities with proceeds invested in high-quality fixed income. These trades were executed at an average price equivalent of 3,281 on the S&P 500 compared to the March month end level of 2,585. We continue to proactively employ a disciplined risk and return framework to the portfolio as economic conditions evolve.  Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review results for the Life, Benefits and Annuities segment. Allstate Life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $80 million in the first quarter, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by lower operating costs and expenses. Allstate Benefits' adjusted net income of $24 million in the first quarter was $7 million below the prior year quarter. The decline was due to higher operating costs and expenses, driven by increased investments in technology and higher DAC amortization. Allstate Annuities, shown on the bottom right, had an adjusted net loss of $139 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the performance-based investment results we discussed earlier.  Coronavirus claims did not appear to materially impact any of these businesses in the first quarter, though we continue to monitor developments closely.  Now let's turn to Slide 9 to talk about our Service Businesses. The Service Businesses continued to increase the number of customers protected with policy in-force growth of 35.4% to $113.7 million. This is largely due to the increase in Allstate Protection Plans. Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, grew 18.2% to $454 million in the first quarter. Adjusted net income improved to $37 million in the first quarter, reflecting an increase of $26 million compared to the first quarter of 2019, driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services.  Slide 10 highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. While the impact of the coronavirus drove financial market instability and led to a decline in shareholders' equity, Allstate's diversified business model, substantial earnings capacity and strong capital and liquidity enables us to manage effectively through this pandemic. We have $3.4 billion in parent company holding deployable assets and $8.8 billion of highly liquid securities saleable within 1 week. We continued to generate strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 18.2% as of the end of the first quarter while returning $670 million to common shareholders in the quarter through a combination of $511 million in share repurchases and $159 million in common stock dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases under our current $3 billion program, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.  And now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the coronavirus impact on auto insurance and how we're leveraging data and insights to make decisions. Sure. Elyse, thanks for the questions. So I think the place I'd start, Elyse, is we feel really good about our capital and liquidity position, $3.4 billion of holding company assets, $8.8 billion of readily available liquidity, $3.7 billion of dividend capacity out of our insurance companies into the holding company for the year. And our businesses are performing really well. So I think I'd say we expect to complete the program by the end of next year just like our Board authorized. And we've got a lot of flexibility in terms of how we execute it, but we would expect to just continue to buy back shares over that time period. Yes, sure. So when you look at the expense ratio in the quarter, you saw a 1 point sequential decline year-over-year in the expense ratio. And first thing I'd say is, reducing our cost continues to be a core part of our transformative growth strategy. And when you kind of deconstruct where the improvement came from, it's about 50-50, not quite between acquisition costs and operating costs.  And obviously, those are two core parts of our cost structure, and we saw improvement in both. And we're going to continue to be focused on reducing those costs going forward to enhance our competitive position to still take growth and be a core part of transformative growth for us.  We're also going to continue to invest in the things we need to invest in for transformative growth, things like technology and marketing. But we're focused going forward on continuing to reduce costs over time. I'll turn it over to Glenn to talk a little bit about the agency part of it. Sure. So Greg, I guess where I'd start is, as we've said in the past, generally, we record performance-based income on a 1-quarter lag based on the partner financial statements as of the prior quarter end. So for example, in the first quarter, we would have relied on year-end partner financial statements. And that's typically how we would approach the accounting.  However, our accounting policy does require that when a material market event occurs, and we have information available to make informed estimates, that we need to take that information into account. And that's what we did this quarter. So we made the two adjustments, the -- marking the public equity holdings in some of the partnership holdings to March 31 levels, and then suppressing the increases in unrealized valuation on securities that were reflected in the year-end financial statement. We did that because that's part of the accounting policy because there was a material market event in the quarter.  The other piece was the -- just our normal watchlist process where we go through every holding. And to the extent we believe we need to impair a holding, we do that. And that was worth $137 million in the quarter on four specific holdings. So absent another market disruption event, let's say, hopefully, we avoid one this quarter, we'll go back to what our typical process would be. But because there was this disruption event in the first quarter, our policy required that if we had additional information that we could make good estimates based on, we should do that. And that's exactly what we did. Sure. Again, what I'd say is I'd reiterate. Look, a core part of our strategy is to continue to look to take costs out of the system and the general downward view of our expense ratio to improve competitive position.  Having said that, you did say, you articulated a couple of the items that are going to cause some choppiness in that. Number one is the outlook on revenue, which there's uncertainty around that, but also, we're going to continue to make investments in things, like I said, technology and marketing. So I guess what I'd say is, look, our focus is still on reducing costs and driving the expense ratio down over time.  I'm not going to sit here today and give you an exact trajectory of what that's going to look like. But strategically, that continues to be a core part of what we're trying to do. Sure. So on -- with respect to the SIPP payment, we saw we recorded a portion of it in the first quarter. The balance will be recorded in the second quarter. So that one's pretty straightforward. That will happen. When we kind of decided on the SIPP payment, one of the things we explicitly factored in was the potential for bad debt expense associated with the special payment plan that we're allowing our customers to opt into. As we evaluated the number of customers that had opted into that as of the end of March, along with our historical bad debt experience, the impact in the first quarter from a bad debt perspective was pretty immaterial. Obviously, we will look at the number of customers that have signed up as well as the exposure going forward. And we'll take that into account in the second quarter in terms of establishing bad debt prospectively. But first quarter was reasonably immaterial. Second quarter, we'll take a look at the analysis. We'll update it appropriately, and then we'll record something incremental in the second quarter."

After the prepared remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please be aware that this call is being recorded. And now I would like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jerome. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related materials on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2020 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Before I hand it off to Tom, I would like to turn to Slide 2 and discuss the expansion of Allstate's Investor Communications. Beginning this year, instead of a traditional Investor Day, we will be conducting a series of 60 minute investor calls to provide deeper insights into significant strategic or operational topics. These calls will be in addition to our quarterly earnings calls. Our first call will focus on the current auto insurance operating environment and will be scheduled to take place in March. Topics on future calls may include homeowners insurance, independent agent channel strategy, expansion of protection services and investments. In addition to investor calls, we will also begin disclosing the company's auto insurance implemented rate actions from the prior month on our Investor Relations website to provide additional information on premium growth. Rate disclosures will be posted on the third Thursday of every month, like our monthly catastrophe loss disclosures, though the rate postings will occur regardless of whether there is a catastrophe loss release in the month. I look forward to the additional engagement these changes will bring. And now I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's start on Slide 3. As you know, Allstate refocus on execution and innovation as ways to create shareholder value. And our strategy has two components: increase personal property-liability market share and then expand protection solutions, which are shown on the two ovals on the left. If you start with the upper oval, we've been a leader in product innovation a multichannel distribution and leveraging technology in telematics and claims settlement. So we're now building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution through transformative growth. We're also diversifying our businesses by expanding protection options as shown in the bottom oval. We offer customers a wide range of protection, good workplace benefits, commercial insurance, roadside services, car warranties, protection plans and identity protection. Avail is a leading innovator in telematics and Avail \u2013 sorry, Arity is leading entity in telematics, and Avail is a start-up, which is basically an Airbnb model for Parisien. We leverage the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities to drive growth in those businesses as well. On the right panel, you can see our five annual operating priorities, which focus on both near-term performance and long-term value currency. So let's move to Slide 4 and go through those operating priorities for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our revenues of $13 billion in the quarter increased 18.7% compared to the prior year quarter, resulting in over $50 billion of revenue for the full year 2021, then reflected by a 1 percentage point increase in auto insurance market share through the National General acquisition, growth in homeowners premiums and then we also had strong growth at Allstate Protection Plans and higher investment income. Property-Liability premiums increased 17%. Net investment income of $847 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased to $187 million compared to 2020, which reflects really strong results from the performance-based portfolio. Net income was $790 million in the quarter compared to $2.6 billion in the prior year as lower underwriting income and a loss related to the sale of the life and annuities business was only partially offset by the higher investment income. Adjusted net income, remember that our measure takes out some of the things that we think are not related to the current economics, was $796 million or $2.75 per diluted share, a decline compared to the $1.6 billion generated in the prior year quarter reflecting lower underwriting income. You'll remember that 2020 had low auto accident frequency, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. 2021 was a year of \u2013 really a two distinct halves as it related to profitability of auto insurance. In the first half of 2021, auto insurance underwriting income benefited as lower accident frequency, offset increased claims severity. As a result, underwriting income for auto insurance totaled over $1.7 billion in the first two quarters. In the second half of the year, auto claim frequency continued to increase towards pre-pandemic levels and the cost of repairing cars and settling bodily injury claims accelerated. We began increasing auto insurance rates in the third quarter and this accelerated in the fourth quarter. These rate increases, however, are earned as policies renew so that the cost increase has resulted in an underwriting loss of slightly over $450 million in the last two quarters. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance was 92.5 for the full year and 100.2 for the fourth quarter of 2021. And while that generates good underwriting income for the year and a good economic return, the results of the last two quarters are not acceptable, so we're highly focused on raising returns in the auto insurance, as Glenn will discuss in a few minutes. Adjusted net income of $4 billion for the full year was $13.48 per share, which generated a return on common shareholders' equity of 16.9%. Let's go to Slide 5 to go through the operating priority results in more detail. To better serve customers, we lowered expenses to improve the competitive price position of auto insurance. The enterprise Net Promoter Score finished slightly below the prior year, but in part, that reflects the absence of the beneficial impact in 2020 of the pandemic-related customer accommodations. You'll remember, it included $1 billion of shelter-in-place program payments, expanded coverage of longer payment term. This year, we expanded protection offerings in group and health individual products with the acquisition of National General. We significantly grew our customer base in 2021, with total policies in force increasing 9.8% to $190.9 million. Property-Liability policies of course, increased by 13.7% as due to the acquisition of National General, expansion of our direct distribution in the Allstate brand and increased insurance provided through Allstate agents. Protection Services policies also continued to grow, increasing 8.9% to $148.4 million. On the third priority, achieve target returns on capital that was accomplished. We completed the year with adjusted net income of $4 billion and a return on shareholders' equity of 16.9%. Despite the rising loss costs environment, the property-liability combined ratio finished 2021 at 95.9. Protection Services continues to grow profitably, it's really driven by Allstate Protection Plans. And then net investment income was $3.3 billion in 2021 reflecting proactive portfolio management and exceptional performance-based income, as Mario will take you through later as well. The total return on our portfolio was 4.4%, so sustainable value creation refers not only strong execution on the first four items, but long-term growth platform. In 2021, we sold life and annuities business for $4.4 billion. We acquired National General for $4 billion to capture expense savings, leveraging independent agent technology platform and improve our strategic position in this distribution channel. Significant progress was made on transformative growth to build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. Allstate Protection Plans continued its rapid growth with written premiums of $1.8 billion that's 5x greater than when the company was acquired five years ago. Arity, our telematics company continues to expand its services and launch highly innovative products. Execution and innovation lead to sustainable value creation. Now let me turn it over to Glenn to discuss property liability results in more detail.\nGlenn Shapiro: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing property-liability profitability in the fourth quarter on Slide 6. The recorded combined ratio of 98.9 increased 14.9 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher underwriting losses as well as prior year reserve strengthening. The chart on the bottom left takes you through the impact of each component compared to the prior year quarter. Auto insurance underwriting loss ratio drove most of the increase driven by the impact of rising inflation on auto severity and higher auto accident frequency compared to the prior year. Prior year reserve were strengthening of $182 million had a 1.8 point impact on the combined ratio in the quarter, primarily due to adverse loss development in auto insurance casualty coverage. There was also a sizable impact relative to the premium in shared economy business, which was primarily driven in states we no longer insure with transportation network carriers. This was partially offset by lower underwriting expense ratio, mostly due to lower advertising expenses in the quarter. We continue to focus on cost reductions, which improve our operational flexibility and competitive position. The chart on the lower right shows Allstate's adjusted expense ratio over the last few years. And the adjusted expense ratio as a measure we're using to track our progress on improving value for customers through cost reductions. The measure starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excludes restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchase intangibles and investment in advertising. It then adds our claim expense ratio, excluding catastrophe claims costs. The adjusted expense ratio improved to 26 in the full year 2021, which is 0.6 point better than prior year and 3.2 lower than 2018. Our long-term objective is a further reduction of 3 points over the next three years, which would represent a 6 point reduction over the six years following 2018, allowing us to improve competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. Slide 7 provides further insight into the drivers of rising auto insurance loss costs. Allstate Protection auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 100.2 in the fourth quarter and 92.5 through the full year 2021, representing increases of 15.3 and 7.4 points, respectively. The increases reflect higher loss costs due to severity and accident frequency, partially offset by lower expenses. While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, reflecting a return to more normal driving environment, we continue to see favorability compared to pre-pandemic levels. Allstate brand auto property damage frequency was up 21.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, but it was down 13.3% compared to 2019. While we've seen miles driven approach pre-pandemic levels, we've seen a meaningful change in time of day driving, which continues to impact both frequency and severity. Increases in auto severity reflect inflationary pressure across coverages with a number of underlying components of severity rising faster than core inflation. Chart on the lower left shows used car values began increasing in late 2020 and accelerated in mid-2021 in a total increase of 68% beginning in 2019. OEM parts and labor rates have also accelerated in 2021, resulting in higher severities and coverages like collision and property damage. The impact of inflation is also influencing our casualty coverage. During 2020, at the onset of the pandemic, when there was less road congestion and higher speeds, a higher proportion of accidents were more severe. That resulted in more severe injuries per claim and higher average casualty severity. And as 2021 developed, casualty costs continue to rise with more severe injuries, medical inflation and higher medical consumption and higher attorney representation rates. The chart on the lower right breaks down auto report year losses, excluding catastrophe over the past two years. The impact of frequency was favorable in 2020 compared to 2019 with the pandemic. And as you shift into 2021, that favorability is partially reversed, creating a negative year-over-year frequency impact, but still favorable over two years. The impact from higher severities on the other hand were compounded over the two year period and put pressure on both physical damage and casualty coverages. The combination of these factors led to the auto insurance margin pressure that we've seen in the second half of 2021. So let's move to Slide 8 and go deeper into the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability. Allstate has, as you all know, have generated strong auto insurance margins over a long period of time. This is a core capability of ours and we are taking a comprehensive and prescriptive approach to respond to the inflationary pressure and return to our auto margin targets in the mid-90s combined ratio. There are three areas of focus: reducing expenses, which we've talked about, raising rates and managing loss costs through claim effectiveness. Since we already talked about the expenses, I'll start with the rates. And the chart on the lower left, it provides a view into 2021 rate actions. We implemented rate decreases in early 2021 to reflect, in part, Allstate's lower expense ratio and the reduced frequency we were experiencing from the pandemic. But as the year progressed and inflation escalated, we responded with rate increases that began in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter. As those continued, you see in the fourth quarter, we took rate in 25 locations at an average increase of 7.1% and a weighted Allstate brand auto premium impact of 2.9%. We'll continue to take rate increases to restore auto profitability at targeted levels, and we'll keep you posted monthly, as Mark mentioned earlier, so that you know where we are on the rates. The chart on the right shows the estimated annual impact of the premium from the implemented rate in each quarter. To relate these two views together that large 2.9% increase implemented in the fourth quarter that you see on the left table, relates directly to the rightmost bar of $702 million in estimated annual written premium. While the rate will obviously help our margin, it takes a little time to be realized, as Tom mentioned, there's an inherent lag between when rates are implemented and when they're reflected in written premium and then ultimately in earned premium. As auto insurance policies generally have a six month term, it takes that time for all of the policies to have renewed at the new rate. And then the annualized written premium impact is fully reflected after 10 months \u2013 after 12 months. As we take more price increases in 2022, the incremental rate will be combined and drive higher levels of written premium first and then average earned premium second as the year progresses and we favorably impact auto margins. Beyond expense reductions and rate increases, we're also leveraging advanced claim capabilities to mitigate loss cost pressure for our customers. We're broadening strategic partnerships with part suppliers and repair facilities to mitigate repair costs. We're using advanced claim analytics and predictive modeling tools to optimize repair versus total loss decisions and to assess the likelihood for injury and attorney representation on casualty claims. The bottom line is we are highly confident in our ability to restore auto profitability to targeted levels. And while auto results tend to dominate discussions around the personal lines industry, it's really important to recognize that broad product suite we offer, as Tom mentioned earlier, and in particular, our homeowners insurance product. So moving to Slide 9, I want to spend a few minutes on our industry-leading homeowners business. A majority of our customers bundle home and auto insurance, which improves retention and overall economics of both lines. And simply put, we have a differentiated homeowners ecosystem including product, underwriting, reinsurance, claims capabilities that are unique in the industry. As a proof point to that, since 2017, we've earned $3.3 billion or an average of $667 million a year in underwriting income, while the industry has generated close to an $18 billion underwriting loss from 2017 to 2020. The graph at the bottom left shows homeowners insurance combined ratios for Allstate select competitors and the industry overall since 2011 and you can see there that Allstate's consistently outperformed. We're well positioned to maintain our margins in homeowners and to continue growing it. Our House & Home product is designed to address severe weather risks and has sophisticated pricing features and inflation factors that respond to changes in replacement values, which is particularly important during an inflationary environment like the one we're in. The chart on the lower right shows Allstate homeowners net written premium over time as well as policies in force. We've grown policies in force steadily, increasing to 1.5% up at year-end, and our Allstate agents are in a great position to continue to broaden customer relationships with homeowners products. Net written premium has really taken off through 2021 reaching 13.8% variance by the fourth quarter. Now the increasing spread between those two lines, the net written premium and the policies in force, is due to an increased average in premium per policy, which has steadily grown through 2021. That is mostly due to the premium rising with the increases we saw in replacement costs and to a lesser extent rate increases. That view that difference that I just illustrated really helps show how our product reacts quickly to inflationary forces and allows us to better match price and risk. On the claims side, we've made investments in technology with photo, video and aerial imagery for timely and accurate loss cost management. Shifting to National General's homeowners book. It provides us an awesome opportunity to grow in the independent agent channel, and we're really optimistic about the ability to bundle there with independent agents when we're deploying new middle-market products on the National General ecosystem. But in the near-term, we're focused on improving their profitability in homeowners by leveraging Allstate's expertise in data, pricing sophistication and underwriting capabilities. Our ultimate goal is to meet customers' protection needs while optimizing shareholder risk and return. We underwrite risk directly in homeowners where we can achieve targeted returns. We also broker other insurers property policies where we can meet protection needs for customers, but we can't achieve the adequate returns that we require, and this allows us to maintain an auto relationship with them. We also shift a lot of our catastrophe risk to reinsurance markets, including traditional reinsurance and alternative capital covering both individual large events and an annual aggregate cover. All in, as I said at the start of this, we have a differentiated homeowners insurance capability in the market, and it operates as a really strong diversifying book of business while we improve auto margins. So with that, let me turn it over to Mario to cover the remainder of our results before we move to questions.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Glenn. Let's move to Slide 10 and discuss how transformative growth positions us for long-term success. So as we've discussed on past calls, transformative growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by delivering on four-key objectives: improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing both the sophistication and investment in customer acquisition and deploying a new technology ecosystem. We made significant progress across each objective in 2021. Our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. By leveraging our industry-leading telematics offering as well as advanced data and analytics, we are able to redesign products to create competitively differentiated offerings for our customers. We have transformed our Allstate agent model to increase growth and decrease distribution costs. We've improved the strength of our direct channel through lower pricing and enhanced capabilities, and the acquisition of National General further improved our strategic position in the independent agent channel. Customer acquisition costs relative to lifetime value have improved with higher close rates and increased use of analytics to improve marketing effectiveness. As a result, we invested more in marketing in 2021. We also made progress on deploying the technology necessary to achieve transformative growth. New customer and product management ecosystems will improve ease of use and self-service capabilities at lower costs. We are using both purchased and proprietary software, which is currently in dark deployment before it is operationally tested this year. Delivering on each objective in an integrated way enables us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value. Turning to Slide 11. Let's look how transformative growth has already begun to successfully drive results in our Property-Liability business. In the chart on the left, you will see Property-Liability policies in force grew by 13.7% compared to the prior year quarter, driven predominantly by the National General acquisition. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4.2 million policies and Allstate brand Property-Liability policies increased 374,000, reflecting enhanced direct channel capabilities and growth in homeowners sold through Allstate agents. Property-Liability policies in force also grew organically by 1.5% from 37.5 million to 38.3 million in 2021, driven by contributions from growth in both the Allstate and National General brands, reflecting enhanced direct and independent agent capabilities. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of new issued applications for personal auto, which grew 61% compared to the prior year. The middle section of the chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which grew 4.3% compared to the prior year. Existing exclusive agents increased new business compared to the prior year, but that increase was offset by fewer appointments of new agents. As you know, we significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020 as we've been developing and deploying a new agent model to drive higher growth at a lower cost. The direct channel now represents 30% of new auto policies and grew by 28% compared to the prior year. This more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would historically have been generated by newly appointed agents. On the far right of the chart, you can see the significant impact of National General, which added 2 million applications in 2021. Slide 12 shows how Protection Services continues to generate profitable growth. Revenues, which exclude the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, increased 21.9% to $606 million in the quarter and increased 23.5% to $2.3 billion for the full-year 2021. The increase in revenues was driven by continued growth at Allstate Protection Plans and Arity. Allstate Protection Plans grew revenue by 23.8% and written premium by 49.1% for the full year 2021 compared to the prior year, driven by expanded products and partnerships, including the successful launch of the Home Depot relationship earlier in 2021. As written premium is earned over policy periods that can range from one to five years, it will continue to generate future revenue growth as we earn the $2 billion of unearned premium associated with Allstate Protection Plans on our balance sheet as of year-end. Arity expanded revenues by integrating lead cloud and transparently into its customer offerings, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition as well as increased device revenue, driven by growth in the Milewise product. Policies in force increased 8.9% to 148 million, primarily due to growth at Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $179 million for the full year 2021 represented an increase of $26 million compared to the prior year, driven by growth at Allstate Protection Plans. We will continue to invest in growing these businesses as they provide an attractive opportunity to both meet customer needs and create economic value for our shareholders. Let's move to Slide 13 and talk about the Allstate Health and Benefits segment, which generated growth and increased profit reflecting the National General acquisition. We've been offering voluntary benefits through the employer channel for over 20 years, and the acquisition of National General added both group and individual health products to our portfolio. These additions drove a significant increase in revenue with premiums and contract charges increasing 66.5% to the prior year. It also brought in a stream of $359 million of additional revenue, shown as other revenue on this slide, primarily from administrative fees and commissions from sales of nonproprietary health products. Adjusted net income more than doubled to $208 million in 2021 and as higher income from the National General acquisition was partially offset by a higher benefit ratio, reflecting higher life mortality in 2021 and lower benefit utilization in the prior year. Now let's move to Slide 14, which highlights our investment performance. Net investment income totaled $847 million in the quarter, which was $187 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $516 million in the quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting private equity appreciation and direct asset sales. As in prior quarters, we experienced broad-based private equity valuation increases. Several large idiosyncratic contributions \u2013 contributors meaningfully impacted results in the quarter with about 50% of performance-based investment income generated by 10 individual investments. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $7 million below the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing yield was largely mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. During 2021, the portfolio also generated more than $1 billion in net gains on investments and derivative instruments, including $428 million from valuation of market-based equity investments and $167 million of net gains from the performance-based portfolio, primarily from gains on sales of direct real estate investments. Our total portfolio return was 1.1% in the fourth quarter and 4.4% year-to-date, reflecting income and higher equity valuations, partially offset by higher interest rates. On the right, we've provided our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over various time horizons. Our total portfolio returns have been strong across these time periods with contributions from both our market-based and performance-based portfolios. The market-based portfolio delivers predictable earnings to support business needs with returns highly influenced by public markets. The performance-based portfolio is deployed against capital and longer liabilities and supplements market risk with idiosyncratic risk. Equity investments have higher long-term returns, which compensate investors for higher volatility, and we have sufficient capital to hold these assets through the full investment cycle. Our performance-based portfolio has experienced returns above our historical trend over the last several quarters. While prospective returns will depend on future economic and market conditions, we do expect these returns to moderate from last year's level. Now let's go to Slide 15 to discuss our proactive portfolio management. Our investment portfolio is a key contributor to shareholder value and is highly integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return processes. The divestiture of the life and annuity businesses reduced our portfolio from $94 billion at year-end 2020 to $65 billion today and provided us an opportunity to shift our asset allocation to increase risk-adjusted returns. Since most of these \u2013 of the assets backing our life and annuity business were fixed income securities, the divestiture lowered overall enterprise interest rate and credit risk. As a result, we increased our allocation to higher returning equity investments while maintaining the total amount of capital backing investment risks. As you can see from the bottom left, higher return public equity and performance-based investments now account for 23% of the overall portfolio. These investments do have more volatility than fixed income securities, so we allocate more capital to support them, but the higher return more than offset \u2013 more than offsets the risk of increased volatility, creating additional shareholder value. Over three-fourth of the portfolio is still fixed income securities, which generates consistent cash flow. The result is a higher returning portfolio with lower interest rate risk overall. We actively manage interest rate risk and consider how it impacts overall enterprise risk and return. As you can see in the blue bars on the right chart, we extended duration from 2018 to 2020 when interest rates shown in the orange line were declining. This mitigated the impact of lower interest rates on auto insurance prices and was a balanced risk and return position from an enterprise perspective. In 2021, we concluded that interest rates were not sufficiently compensating us for the risk that interest rates would rise, which would have a negative impact on the valuation of our bond portfolio. As you know, the consumer price index increased throughout 2021, shown by the light blue line on the chart, and we've discussed at length the impact that inflation has had on auto insurance margins. As a result, we shortened the duration of the fixed income portfolio through the sale of long corporate and municipal bonds and to a lesser extent, the use of derivatives. We are taking additional actions in 2022 to further reduce the negative impact higher interest rates would have on fixed income valuation. This will lower fixed income portfolio yield and investment income for the near term, but positions the portfolio to reinvest into higher rates if they continue to rise. Finally, let's move to Slide 16, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position. Allstate's capital position remains strong and enables significant cash returns to shareholders while investing in growth. We returned $4.1 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends in 2021. The common dividend was increased 50% compared to 2020, and common shares outstanding were reduced by 7.8% over the last 12 months. So if you held a share of stock at the beginning of 2020, you now own 7.8% more of the enterprise. As of year-end 2021, we had $3.3 billion remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by March 31, 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Shanker: Yeah, thank you. My first question, in the prepared statements in the press release, you mentioned the idea of rationalizing expenses in order to get back to profitability. You also have a goal of reducing your expense ratio by 300 basis points through transforming growth over the next three-years. Are you accelerating the process? Are you going to be taking some costs out that will return in 2023, but be offset by some more restructuring? How do the different parts of that play together? Hello? Hello?\nGlenn Shapiro: Hello. Tom, did you want to start?\nJoshua Shanker: Maybe we lost Tom.\nGlenn Shapiro: Mario, you should start.\nMario Rizzo: Okay. All right.\nTom Wilson: It sounds like \u2013 Josh, can you hear me?\nJoshua Shanker: Yes, yes. Go ahead.\nTom Wilson: Okay Great. It only took me five tries with hash six or star six. First, I don't think you should think about \u2013 there are obviously things you do in the short term like we reduced advertising a little bit in the fourth quarter because we don't want to go get a bunch of customers and then end up with a large price increase in the next six months. So you manage that. But in general, when you look at our expense reduction program, it's well laid out. I think it's another three years. It includes everything from using digital processes and getting rid of extra labor to using more outsourcing and cleaning up our processes and reducing our technology costs with the new platform. So those things will roll out. You can't really accelerate those because it has impact on customers. So we're not doing anything for 2022 to just get to our number that then you're going to turn around and look at 2023 and say, jeez, I thought you were profitable and now you're not. So we take a longer-term view of that. That's a little different in pricing and that we will be more aggressive early on in pricing and try to get ahead of the curve as opposed to trying to smooth that out over a multiyear period. Mario or Glenn, anything you would add to that?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, Josh, this is Mario. Thanks for the question. I would agree with Tom, I think what we're focused on is permanent cost reductions that will on a sustained basis improve our competitive position and improve customer value and really enable profitable growth. And we're going to continue to focus on things like operating costs and distribution costs that we can permanently take out of the system. And as Tom mentioned, leveraging tools like automation, process redesign off-shoring where we can and really kind of implement plans that do take time and aren't the kinds of things that I think you can accelerate the execution of. But we're also not focused on ripping a bunch of costs out, that's just going to come back into the system. We want to make the cost reductions permanent, achieve the three points over time because that will really position us to grow and grow at really attractive returns going forward.\nJoshua Shanker: So the expense ratio was a little high obviously in the quarter, and I'm actually referring to in the press release where you said that you're going to drive down expenses it seemed like it was more reactive to what's going on right now, there's a short-term benefit. At least I'm trying to find the wording in the press release. In response, Allstate is reducing expenses and claims loss management, reducing expenses here in response. I mean, obviously, you have the transformative growth plan, but is there an initiative on top of that to reduce expenses to get you to a healthy underwriting profit in the near-term associated with the spike in losses?\nTom Wilson: Josh, I don't \u2013 we did not mean for it to have that interpretation. When you look at improving profitability in auto insurance, number one thing will be increased our rates. As the lowering expenses, as part of Mario said, the growth objective or transformed growth plan, that will obviously help, but we would have done that anyway. In fact, we started at like two or three years ago, and we're really glad we did it because we came into this year with, as Glenn pointed out, about 3 points lower than we would have been had we not started. But that's ongoing piece, but it's a component of improving profitability, but it's just not \u2013 not like we started in claim loss cost management is somewhere in between the two, you're always using data analytics and new claim processes, new relationships with vendors to try to reduce your cost. But as the cost change in the locus of those cost changes. Sometimes you have to adjust the programs you have in place \u2013 so I would say that the primary thing to focus on is rate increases in terms of the near-term improvement in auto profitability.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGreg Peters: Good morning, everyone. I would like to turn our attention to Slide 8 of your investor presentation and where you roll through the details about the rate increases that you're \u2013 that you've achieved and your expectations going forward. I guess just in the chart that's in the bottom left, just a further clarification on that. It's this number of locations, 25. Is locations the same thing as states? Or are we dealing with 100 locations? And then when we see an Allstate brand increase of 2.9%, is that a quarterly increase that we can annualize? And I guess where this is going is just trying to figure out the rate you're getting versus where the loss cost trend is and if you're catching up exceeding it or still behind?\nTom Wilson: Greg, I understand the need and desire to get to the math, and that's why we've added the monthly disclosure. Glenn, do you want to take the specifics on the slide?\nGlenn Shapiro: Sure. So directly answering the question, the 2.9% is an annualized and the 25 states. So this truly is like if we stopped, if all we did was the fourth quarter, we got 2.9% rate increase across our book of business. We're not stopping in the fourth quarter, and we did a little bit in the third quarter, we took about $800 million in rate increases between the two quarters and we'll continue to. But that amount of money, when you look at the right side, you look at the 81 and the 702 that is the full impact of the rate increase.\nTom Wilson: Greg, when we get to the \u2013 when we do the auto call in March, we'll give you a little more specifics on how to calculate that because the 2.9% is based on the \u2013 it's a dollar, right? We have a dollar number of what we think we're going to get. It's 2.9% is 2.9% times the prior year premiums. As the prior year premiums, if you look at the total, of course, when you're raising rates, it keeps going up, too. So the full year number is not the annualized number of December. So we'll help you figure out how to do that in March.\nGreg Peters: Got it. I appreciate the color. And by the way, the increased disclosure, I think, is appropriate, considering where you guys are, so applaud that change. I guess the other \u2013 the big picture question around the slide and just the market environment. Obviously, the auto market is under a lot of duress right now with inflation issues. And there's been news reports from different states and different regulators about pushback on rate increase filings. And I thought maybe you could give us an update of \u2013 I don't want to go state by state, but some of the big target states, how the regulators are responding to the data that you're showing them, is it a process that's going to take a while? Or do you think they're receptive immediately? Just if you could give us sort of a state of the union on the regulatory front, that would be helpful.\nTom Wilson: Glenn, could you handle that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Sure, will. So Greg, it's a great question. And I know we've been the last couple of quarters. So the conversation has been a lot about will it be pushback? How do we do it? I think the evidence \u2013 this page that you pointed us back to, Page 8, the evidence is pretty clear. 25 states implemented at a 7.1% average increase. We are continuing to go at a very fast pace across other states and even in some cases, the same states, again, with rate increases as we get new data and new trends. And to this point, we have \u2013 you're always going to experience some discussions, some push on the data, some negotiation, if you will, and some back and forth. But we've \u2013 you can see it there, those are implemented rates. And we've been successful. And our people, and I give a ton of credit to our state managers and our product team who've done over years, an incredible job of building relationships because they provide a lot of detail when they do a rate increase or a decrease, any type of rate change we make. And we get great responses because ultimately, these are numbers people talking to numbers people. It is less \u2013 most often anyway, is less a political issue than it is a reality issue of looking at the numbers and what is the justifiable and supportable rate increase. And again, we've been very successful so far. We have no reason to believe we won't continue to be. We'll have pushback in places, and we'll have discussions and give and take. But overall, we're getting the rates that we need, and we're going to continue to do that.\nTom Wilson: Greg, it's \u2013 the regulators come out of when they want to treat customers fairly. And as Glenn pointed out, the first thing they want is transparency, and our team spends a tremendous amount of time trying to be transparent with the regulators. It's also about what's your history with them. So we did a shelter and place payback of $1 billion. No regulator asked us or forces to do it. We did it proactively within my 10 days of noticing this guy here and his team got organized on it. So it's not like they do everything we want, but it's about treating customers fairly. And then in addition, when you're going in on the physical damage coverages, it's paid in 90 days. So there's not a great debate over whether the money went out or not. It just does. And then finally, injury, can be a little more discussion around it because there are longer-term trends, but we have good math on that as well. So we're confident we can get our combined ratio into the target level that Glenn talked about, which is in mid-90s.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for all the help. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about auto claim severity on sort of an ongoing basis because maybe the Manheim used car prices don't do this incredible increase again. And so I think if there's anything you can do to help us kind of figure out what that trend would be if you pull out some of the real extraordinary things that happened over the last six months. So I think that might help us get to a better kind of ongoing run rate.\nTom Wilson: Glenn have some good math on that.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So as we look at severity, a significant majority on the physical damage lines, which you were pointing to, Paul, is driven by the price of cars. It's \u2013 I think I said this last quarter, but I really like the example of if you were \u2013 if you had a life insurance company and all your policy limits went up by 50% or something, with no premium change, you'd have an issue. And really, the value of the car is the policy limit. That's the capitation method for property damage and collision. So that moving up has driven, call it, 80-ish percent of the overall severity issue. So as I look at that, there are a couple of ways you can look at it going forward, and this is not just Allstate, this is looking at the world around us that we operate in. One is when will supply chain issues and chip shortages be corrected, most of what you see externally is that, that will last through 2022. The other one is, is that there's likely some sort of structural maximum that used car prices go to because they probably won't end up exceeding new cars prices. And as we get to a year-over-year comparison, where in Q2 of 2021 was the largest single quarter of increase where there was that really steep uphill climb, at some point, you're not going to have those same type of increases on a year-over-year basis, but you may stabilize at a higher level for some period of time. And that's what we've factored in to the way we're looking at our incurred losses, and it's in there in terms of the way we've reported our results and our severities and how we're looking at it going forward.\nPaul Newsome: What about the inflation on that the non \u2013 sort of the nonlimit piece, that 20%? What do you think that's doing today?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. That is \u2013 so when you look at the \u2013 whether it's repair parts costs are accelerating labor like most industries, labor costs going up, that's continuing to move up. But I think an important way to look at it is if you removed the cost of cars, the used car price that limit going up, everything else combined would be in line with sort of our normal trend for severity, that mid-single-digit trend that you'd expect to see. Now then that's completely excluding one major factor, so I understand that it has a little bias to it because car prices do go up a little bit over time. But it is driving the lion's share of it because it's not like you expect severities to be flat year-over-year. They've moved up. Every year over long, long periods of time, there's just normal inflationary movement that happens in there, wherever it's low single digits, some years, mid-single digits or even higher single digits, other years. what is so extreme right now driving the double-digit increases is that change in car prices, but the 20% that I referred to is labor and repair costs, which we're really looking to tackle by increasing our use of direct repair and leveraging our scale in parts purchasing.\nPaul Newsome: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. First question. Slide 7 shows that auto frequency is still at a $1.4 billion good guy relative to 2019. So my question is, do you expect that frequency to normalize? And if so, is the 7% rate increase that you show on Slide 8, already contemplating that normalized frequency?\nTom Wilson: Glenn, do you want to take that?\nGlenn Shapiro: I will. Yes. So I give a ton of credit to our team that does all our math and our modeling, they've done a really nice job on frequency, and we're sitting just about right on top of where we expected to be a year ago on it. So will it normalize to some degree probably? While we can't predict different things can happen in the world, we can't predict and won't give a forward-looking prediction of frequency, you'd expect there to be some normalization to pre-pandemic levels. But as we've said for a while now that we believe that there is some durable structural change. People aren't going to be commuting to office buildings as frequently as they did before the pandemic. We probably all know many people, including some of ourselves, that don't do that and won't do that even on an ongoing basis. And 40% of our losses occur in rush hour. So the commuting time, Monday to Friday mornings and afternoons, so when you got significantly fewer drivers on 40% of your last time period and that shift in when people drive, it makes changes to both frequency and severity. So we think that there's some durable reduction there that barring all the other things that change around it, would be consistent in the way frequency stays a bit lower. But as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we also see some severity increase from that because the driving has shifted to more leisure times to times where the roads are more open, people are driving faster. It creates harder hits with greater severity, that's hitting us both on the physical damage and the casualty side. So there's just a lot of pieces and parts in there. But to summarize with your question, are we contemplating that in our rate plan? The answer is absolutely yes. We are contemplating in the rate plan, our expectations for frequency, our expectations for severity. And we're going hard after rate, as you can see, and we're not done.\nYaron Kinar: That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate that. Maybe shifting to homeowners for a second. Look, I fully recognize that you have a tremendous track record there and certainly have earned your fair share of income there over the years. That said, if I look at the specific quarter, it seems like you saw some year-over-year deterioration, which seems to be a bit of an outlier relative to some of your earlier reporting peers. I'm just curious as to why this book maybe saw a different trend? I know you called out higher inflationary impact, but was there anything specific to the Allstate book?\nTom Wilson: Yes. It's hard to compare us to other people. If you're talking about Progressive, I'd say our combined ratio is 15 to 20 points better than theirs on a billions of dollars of either theirs or ours, but I don't even think there's a comparison. But \u2013 so we \u2013 the business bounces around a little bit. We get a good return on capital on it. Was it in the high 90s? Is that where we want it to be on a long-term basis? No. There's a bounce around by year, yes. And so we feel highly confident we can continue to differentiate ourselves in this space in that business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Just a question on when you think you'll be able to get to that mid-90s combined ratio in auto? Glenn, I think you've talked about some of the \u2013 I guess, your thinking around some of the moving parts around physical damage or severity. So wondering if you can maybe \u2013 we can zoom out and think your timing when you guys think you guys can get back to that mid-90s targeted combined ratio in personal auto.\nTom Wilson: Good question. I understand why it's important because everybody is trying to figure out the turn and when will it be in the P&L so you can get in early. And I understand the same thing is when people are looking at sort of various rate increases. The headline would be, we're not going to give a projection as to when because you can't predict what will happen to frequency, severity, rate increases. What you can do is look on a longer-term basis and say, when you look at auto insurance and you look at the broad competitive set, Allstate Progressive and GEICO tend to outperform the industry and have combined ratios, which generate attractive returns and just \u2013 you can just graph it out over five or 10 years we all sort of hover in the same place. There are other people like some of the large mutuals and stuff which don't operate at that level, but we've proven an ability to get there. So we think that we'll continue to get there as to the speed of it. Sometimes people ask about the speed, is very idiosyncratic. Like, if your frequency moved up to near \u2013 closer to pre-pandemic levels, earlier than ours did, then you should have been taking price earlier and severities, the same thing, people manage their loss costs differently. So we tend to look at it and say, with the long term, we know how to make money in this business on how we're confident we'll get there. But we've not put a date out which we said we'll be in the mid-90s.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay. Thanks. That's fair. And then for my second \u2013 or my follow-up question just on I just wanted to focus a little bit on the bodily injury severity and some of the casualty changes, some of the charges you took this quarter. Maybe you could help me understand where that's been running. What specifically happened this quarter that made you realize that charge? And I think the last time you spoke about this. You had said that it was more or less in line with medical cost inflation. I think this was a few years ago. And that was notably below your peers back then. So I guess it's sort of a long way of asking, how are you thinking about the BI severity now given the changes that you've made? And how are you reflecting that in your picks going forward?\nTom Wilson: Yes, it's a good question. And the percentage is sometimes get a little confusing because it's a percentage, in other words, it's absolute dollars is the way we reserve to it. Mario, do you want to talk about the reserve changes?\nMario Rizzo: Sure, Tom. So I guess the play side start is we have really strong reserving processes, and we're continually looking at our reserve levels, both for the current report year but also for prior years. And we're taking into account things that we're seeing, both in terms of inflationary trends as well as other phenomenon. And we talked a little bit earlier around things like medical inflation, consumption, attorney representation, those all factor in. So I think, David, the thing we saw this quarter was we continued to see upward development in prior years and some of the casualty coverages. And we took that into account this quarter in terms of raising our ultimate report year expectations for bodily injury in a couple of the prior years. But it was really in reaction to the continuation of some of those trends that I talked about that are causing bodily injury and other casualty severities to increase to levels that were beyond kind of the range of outcomes that we had established earlier on for those prior years. So we reacted to it. We tend to be conservative when we set reserves. But in this particular instance, we saw those trends develop out, and we reacted to it and increased the prior year reserves on auto casualty.\nTom Wilson: So \u2013 and we do it by state and by coverage. I mean so if we \u2013 there's a fair amount of granularity to it, is market is not always as precise as you like because you're trying to guess what it's going to cost us settle to something. Well, thank you for participating. Let me just close by saying, there's two stories here. The narrower story is, it's about the insurance industry and Allstate dealing with auto insurance of profitability caused by inflation in fixing cars and then also fixing bodies. Great longer longitudinal story is, which I don't want to let it on the cutting of the floor is about a significant repositioning of the company while dealing with that issue. So we sold our life business. We spent $4 billion success with our National General into the fold increase our market share by 1%, which different position in the independent agent channel for transformation of the Allstate branded business is going quite well, whether that's expanding direct lowering costs or building out new products and improving our competitive position. And then our Protection Services business is really reached a substantive multibillion dollar level with large source of future revenue growth to come because of the way the time works. And at the same time, we're continuing to buy back shares and pay great dividends. So thank you all for participating, and we'll talk to the next quarter. Actually, we'll talk to you in March when we come back to auto reels.\nOperator: This concludes fourth quarter conference call. You can now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Glenn Shapiro",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing property-liability profitability in the fourth quarter on Slide 6. The recorded combined ratio of 98.9 increased 14.9 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher underwriting losses as well as prior year reserve strengthening. The chart on the bottom left takes you through the impact of each component compared to the prior year quarter. Auto insurance underwriting loss ratio drove most of the increase driven by the impact of rising inflation on auto severity and higher auto accident frequency compared to the prior year. Prior year reserve were strengthening of $182 million had a 1.8 point impact on the combined ratio in the quarter, primarily due to adverse loss development in auto insurance casualty coverage. There was also a sizable impact relative to the premium in shared economy business, which was primarily driven in states we no longer insure with transportation network carriers. This was partially offset by lower underwriting expense ratio, mostly due to lower advertising expenses in the quarter. We continue to focus on cost reductions, which improve our operational flexibility and competitive position. The chart on the lower right shows Allstate's adjusted expense ratio over the last few years. And the adjusted expense ratio as a measure we're using to track our progress on improving value for customers through cost reductions. The measure starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excludes restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchase intangibles and investment in advertising. It then adds our claim expense ratio, excluding catastrophe claims costs. The adjusted expense ratio improved to 26 in the full year 2021, which is 0.6 point better than prior year and 3.2 lower than 2018. Our long-term objective is a further reduction of 3 points over the next three years, which would represent a 6 point reduction over the six years following 2018, allowing us to improve competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. Slide 7 provides further insight into the drivers of rising auto insurance loss costs. Allstate Protection auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 100.2 in the fourth quarter and 92.5 through the full year 2021, representing increases of 15.3 and 7.4 points, respectively. The increases reflect higher loss costs due to severity and accident frequency, partially offset by lower expenses. While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, reflecting a return to more normal driving environment, we continue to see favorability compared to pre-pandemic levels. Allstate brand auto property damage frequency was up 21.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, but it was down 13.3% compared to 2019. While we've seen miles driven approach pre-pandemic levels, we've seen a meaningful change in time of day driving, which continues to impact both frequency and severity. Increases in auto severity reflect inflationary pressure across coverages with a number of underlying components of severity rising faster than core inflation. Chart on the lower left shows used car values began increasing in late 2020 and accelerated in mid-2021 in a total increase of 68% beginning in 2019. OEM parts and labor rates have also accelerated in 2021, resulting in higher severities and coverages like collision and property damage. The impact of inflation is also influencing our casualty coverage. During 2020, at the onset of the pandemic, when there was less road congestion and higher speeds, a higher proportion of accidents were more severe. That resulted in more severe injuries per claim and higher average casualty severity. And as 2021 developed, casualty costs continue to rise with more severe injuries, medical inflation and higher medical consumption and higher attorney representation rates. The chart on the lower right breaks down auto report year losses, excluding catastrophe over the past two years. The impact of frequency was favorable in 2020 compared to 2019 with the pandemic. And as you shift into 2021, that favorability is partially reversed, creating a negative year-over-year frequency impact, but still favorable over two years. The impact from higher severities on the other hand were compounded over the two year period and put pressure on both physical damage and casualty coverages. The combination of these factors led to the auto insurance margin pressure that we've seen in the second half of 2021. So let's move to Slide 8 and go deeper into the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability. Allstate has, as you all know, have generated strong auto insurance margins over a long period of time. This is a core capability of ours and we are taking a comprehensive and prescriptive approach to respond to the inflationary pressure and return to our auto margin targets in the mid-90s combined ratio. There are three areas of focus: reducing expenses, which we've talked about, raising rates and managing loss costs through claim effectiveness. Since we already talked about the expenses, I'll start with the rates. And the chart on the lower left, it provides a view into 2021 rate actions. We implemented rate decreases in early 2021 to reflect, in part, Allstate's lower expense ratio and the reduced frequency we were experiencing from the pandemic. But as the year progressed and inflation escalated, we responded with rate increases that began in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter. As those continued, you see in the fourth quarter, we took rate in 25 locations at an average increase of 7.1% and a weighted Allstate brand auto premium impact of 2.9%. We'll continue to take rate increases to restore auto profitability at targeted levels, and we'll keep you posted monthly, as Mark mentioned earlier, so that you know where we are on the rates. The chart on the right shows the estimated annual impact of the premium from the implemented rate in each quarter. To relate these two views together that large 2.9% increase implemented in the fourth quarter that you see on the left table, relates directly to the rightmost bar of $702 million in estimated annual written premium. While the rate will obviously help our margin, it takes a little time to be realized, as Tom mentioned, there's an inherent lag between when rates are implemented and when they're reflected in written premium and then ultimately in earned premium. As auto insurance policies generally have a six month term, it takes that time for all of the policies to have renewed at the new rate. And then the annualized written premium impact is fully reflected after 10 months \u2013 after 12 months. As we take more price increases in 2022, the incremental rate will be combined and drive higher levels of written premium first and then average earned premium second as the year progresses and we favorably impact auto margins. Beyond expense reductions and rate increases, we're also leveraging advanced claim capabilities to mitigate loss cost pressure for our customers. We're broadening strategic partnerships with part suppliers and repair facilities to mitigate repair costs. We're using advanced claim analytics and predictive modeling tools to optimize repair versus total loss decisions and to assess the likelihood for injury and attorney representation on casualty claims. The bottom line is we are highly confident in our ability to restore auto profitability to targeted levels. And while auto results tend to dominate discussions around the personal lines industry, it's really important to recognize that broad product suite we offer, as Tom mentioned earlier, and in particular, our homeowners insurance product. So moving to Slide 9, I want to spend a few minutes on our industry-leading homeowners business. A majority of our customers bundle home and auto insurance, which improves retention and overall economics of both lines. And simply put, we have a differentiated homeowners ecosystem including product, underwriting, reinsurance, claims capabilities that are unique in the industry. As a proof point to that, since 2017, we've earned $3.3 billion or an average of $667 million a year in underwriting income, while the industry has generated close to an $18 billion underwriting loss from 2017 to 2020. The graph at the bottom left shows homeowners insurance combined ratios for Allstate select competitors and the industry overall since 2011 and you can see there that Allstate's consistently outperformed. We're well positioned to maintain our margins in homeowners and to continue growing it. Our House & Home product is designed to address severe weather risks and has sophisticated pricing features and inflation factors that respond to changes in replacement values, which is particularly important during an inflationary environment like the one we're in. The chart on the lower right shows Allstate homeowners net written premium over time as well as policies in force. We've grown policies in force steadily, increasing to 1.5% up at year-end, and our Allstate agents are in a great position to continue to broaden customer relationships with homeowners products. Net written premium has really taken off through 2021 reaching 13.8% variance by the fourth quarter. Now the increasing spread between those two lines, the net written premium and the policies in force, is due to an increased average in premium per policy, which has steadily grown through 2021. That is mostly due to the premium rising with the increases we saw in replacement costs and to a lesser extent rate increases. That view that difference that I just illustrated really helps show how our product reacts quickly to inflationary forces and allows us to better match price and risk. On the claims side, we've made investments in technology with photo, video and aerial imagery for timely and accurate loss cost management. Shifting to National General's homeowners book. It provides us an awesome opportunity to grow in the independent agent channel, and we're really optimistic about the ability to bundle there with independent agents when we're deploying new middle-market products on the National General ecosystem. But in the near-term, we're focused on improving their profitability in homeowners by leveraging Allstate's expertise in data, pricing sophistication and underwriting capabilities. Our ultimate goal is to meet customers' protection needs while optimizing shareholder risk and return. We underwrite risk directly in homeowners where we can achieve targeted returns. We also broker other insurers property policies where we can meet protection needs for customers, but we can't achieve the adequate returns that we require, and this allows us to maintain an auto relationship with them. We also shift a lot of our catastrophe risk to reinsurance markets, including traditional reinsurance and alternative capital covering both individual large events and an annual aggregate cover. All in, as I said at the start of this, we have a differentiated homeowners insurance capability in the market, and it operates as a really strong diversifying book of business while we improve auto margins. So with that, let me turn it over to Mario to cover the remainder of our results before we move to questions. Hello. Tom, did you want to start? Mario, you should start. Sure. So directly answering the question, the 2.9% is an annualized and the 25 states. So this truly is like if we stopped, if all we did was the fourth quarter, we got 2.9% rate increase across our book of business. We're not stopping in the fourth quarter, and we did a little bit in the third quarter, we took about $800 million in rate increases between the two quarters and we'll continue to. But that amount of money, when you look at the right side, you look at the 81 and the 702 that is the full impact of the rate increase. Sure, will. So Greg, it's a great question. And I know we've been the last couple of quarters. So the conversation has been a lot about will it be pushback? How do we do it? I think the evidence \u2013 this page that you pointed us back to, Page 8, the evidence is pretty clear. 25 states implemented at a 7.1% average increase. We are continuing to go at a very fast pace across other states and even in some cases, the same states, again, with rate increases as we get new data and new trends. And to this point, we have \u2013 you're always going to experience some discussions, some push on the data, some negotiation, if you will, and some back and forth. But we've \u2013 you can see it there, those are implemented rates. And we've been successful. And our people, and I give a ton of credit to our state managers and our product team who've done over years, an incredible job of building relationships because they provide a lot of detail when they do a rate increase or a decrease, any type of rate change we make. And we get great responses because ultimately, these are numbers people talking to numbers people. It is less \u2013 most often anyway, is less a political issue than it is a reality issue of looking at the numbers and what is the justifiable and supportable rate increase. And again, we've been very successful so far. We have no reason to believe we won't continue to be. We'll have pushback in places, and we'll have discussions and give and take. But overall, we're getting the rates that we need, and we're going to continue to do that. Yes. So as we look at severity, a significant majority on the physical damage lines, which you were pointing to, Paul, is driven by the price of cars. It's \u2013 I think I said this last quarter, but I really like the example of if you were \u2013 if you had a life insurance company and all your policy limits went up by 50% or something, with no premium change, you'd have an issue. And really, the value of the car is the policy limit. That's the capitation method for property damage and collision. So that moving up has driven, call it, 80-ish percent of the overall severity issue. So as I look at that, there are a couple of ways you can look at it going forward, and this is not just Allstate, this is looking at the world around us that we operate in. One is when will supply chain issues and chip shortages be corrected, most of what you see externally is that, that will last through 2022. The other one is, is that there's likely some sort of structural maximum that used car prices go to because they probably won't end up exceeding new cars prices. And as we get to a year-over-year comparison, where in Q2 of 2021 was the largest single quarter of increase where there was that really steep uphill climb, at some point, you're not going to have those same type of increases on a year-over-year basis, but you may stabilize at a higher level for some period of time. And that's what we've factored in to the way we're looking at our incurred losses, and it's in there in terms of the way we've reported our results and our severities and how we're looking at it going forward. Yes. That is \u2013 so when you look at the \u2013 whether it's repair parts costs are accelerating labor like most industries, labor costs going up, that's continuing to move up. But I think an important way to look at it is if you removed the cost of cars, the used car price that limit going up, everything else combined would be in line with sort of our normal trend for severity, that mid-single-digit trend that you'd expect to see. Now then that's completely excluding one major factor, so I understand that it has a little bias to it because car prices do go up a little bit over time. But it is driving the lion's share of it because it's not like you expect severities to be flat year-over-year. They've moved up. Every year over long, long periods of time, there's just normal inflationary movement that happens in there, wherever it's low single digits, some years, mid-single digits or even higher single digits, other years. what is so extreme right now driving the double-digit increases is that change in car prices, but the 20% that I referred to is labor and repair costs, which we're really looking to tackle by increasing our use of direct repair and leveraging our scale in parts purchasing. I will. Yes. So I give a ton of credit to our team that does all our math and our modeling, they've done a really nice job on frequency, and we're sitting just about right on top of where we expected to be a year ago on it. So will it normalize to some degree probably? While we can't predict different things can happen in the world, we can't predict and won't give a forward-looking prediction of frequency, you'd expect there to be some normalization to pre-pandemic levels. But as we've said for a while now that we believe that there is some durable structural change. People aren't going to be commuting to office buildings as frequently as they did before the pandemic. We probably all know many people, including some of ourselves, that don't do that and won't do that even on an ongoing basis. And 40% of our losses occur in rush hour. So the commuting time, Monday to Friday mornings and afternoons, so when you got significantly fewer drivers on 40% of your last time period and that shift in when people drive, it makes changes to both frequency and severity. So we think that there's some durable reduction there that barring all the other things that change around it, would be consistent in the way frequency stays a bit lower.

But to summarize with your question, are we contemplating that in our rate plan? The answer is absolutely yes. We are contemplating in the rate plan, our expectations for frequency, our expectations for severity. And we're going hard after rate, as you can see, and we're not done."

            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's start on Slide 3. As you know, Allstate refocus on execution and innovation as ways to create shareholder value. And our strategy has two components: increase personal property-liability market share and then expand protection solutions, which are shown on the two ovals on the left. If you start with the upper oval, we've been a leader in product innovation a multichannel distribution and leveraging technology in telematics and claims settlement. So we're now building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution through transformative growth. We're also diversifying our businesses by expanding protection options as shown in the bottom oval. We offer customers a wide range of protection, good workplace benefits, commercial insurance, roadside services, car warranties, protection plans and identity protection. Avail is a leading innovator in telematics and Avail \u2013 sorry, Arity is leading entity in telematics, and Avail is a start-up, which is basically an Airbnb model for Parisien. We leverage the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities to drive growth in those businesses as well. On the right panel, you can see our five annual operating priorities, which focus on both near-term performance and long-term value currency. So let's move to Slide 4 and go through those operating priorities for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our revenues of $13 billion in the quarter increased 18.7% compared to the prior year quarter, resulting in over $50 billion of revenue for the full year 2021, then reflected by a 1 percentage point increase in auto insurance market share through the National General acquisition, growth in homeowners premiums and then we also had strong growth at Allstate Protection Plans and higher investment income. Property-Liability premiums increased 17%. Net investment income of $847 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased to $187 million compared to 2020, which reflects really strong results from the performance-based portfolio. Net income was $790 million in the quarter compared to $2.6 billion in the prior year as lower underwriting income and a loss related to the sale of the life and annuities business was only partially offset by the higher investment income. Adjusted net income, remember that our measure takes out some of the things that we think are not related to the current economics, was $796 million or $2.75 per diluted share, a decline compared to the $1.6 billion generated in the prior year quarter reflecting lower underwriting income. You'll remember that 2020 had low auto accident frequency, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. 2021 was a year of \u2013 really a two distinct halves as it related to profitability of auto insurance. In the first half of 2021, auto insurance underwriting income benefited as lower accident frequency, offset increased claims severity. As a result, underwriting income for auto insurance totaled over $1.7 billion in the first two quarters. In the second half of the year, auto claim frequency continued to increase towards pre-pandemic levels and the cost of repairing cars and settling bodily injury claims accelerated. We began increasing auto insurance rates in the third quarter and this accelerated in the fourth quarter. These rate increases, however, are earned as policies renew so that the cost increase has resulted in an underwriting loss of slightly over $450 million in the last two quarters. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance was 92.5 for the full year and 100.2 for the fourth quarter of 2021. And while that generates good underwriting income for the year and a good economic return, the results of the last two quarters are not acceptable, so we're highly focused on raising returns in the auto insurance, as Glenn will discuss in a few minutes. Adjusted net income of $4 billion for the full year was $13.48 per share, which generated a return on common shareholders' equity of 16.9%. Let's go to Slide 5 to go through the operating priority results in more detail. To better serve customers, we lowered expenses to improve the competitive price position of auto insurance. The enterprise Net Promoter Score finished slightly below the prior year, but in part, that reflects the absence of the beneficial impact in 2020 of the pandemic-related customer accommodations. You'll remember, it included $1 billion of shelter-in-place program payments, expanded coverage of longer payment term. This year, we expanded protection offerings in group and health individual products with the acquisition of National General. We significantly grew our customer base in 2021, with total policies in force increasing 9.8% to $190.9 million. Property-Liability policies of course, increased by 13.7% as due to the acquisition of National General, expansion of our direct distribution in the Allstate brand and increased insurance provided through Allstate agents. Protection Services policies also continued to grow, increasing 8.9% to $148.4 million. On the third priority, achieve target returns on capital that was accomplished. We completed the year with adjusted net income of $4 billion and a return on shareholders' equity of 16.9%. Despite the rising loss costs environment, the property-liability combined ratio finished 2021 at 95.9. Protection Services continues to grow profitably, it's really driven by Allstate Protection Plans. And then net investment income was $3.3 billion in 2021 reflecting proactive portfolio management and exceptional performance-based income, as Mario will take you through later as well. The total return on our portfolio was 4.4%, so sustainable value creation refers not only strong execution on the first four items, but long-term growth platform. In 2021, we sold life and annuities business for $4.4 billion. We acquired National General for $4 billion to capture expense savings, leveraging independent agent technology platform and improve our strategic position in this distribution channel. Significant progress was made on transformative growth to build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. Allstate Protection Plans continued its rapid growth with written premiums of $1.8 billion that's 5x greater than when the company was acquired five years ago. Arity, our telematics company continues to expand its services and launch highly innovative products. Execution and innovation lead to sustainable value creation. Now let me turn it over to Glenn to discuss property liability results in more detail. It sounds like \u2013 Josh, can you hear me? Okay Great. It only took me five tries with hash six or star six. First, I don't think you should think about \u2013 there are obviously things you do in the short term like we reduced advertising a little bit in the fourth quarter because we don't want to go get a bunch of customers and then end up with a large price increase in the next six months. So you manage that. But in general, when you look at our expense reduction program, it's well laid out. I think it's another three years. It includes everything from using digital processes and getting rid of extra labor to using more outsourcing and cleaning up our processes and reducing our technology costs with the new platform. So those things will roll out. You can't really accelerate those because it has impact on customers. So we're not doing anything for 2022 to just get to our number that then you're going to turn around and look at 2023 and say, jeez, I thought you were profitable and now you're not. So we take a longer-term view of that. That's a little different in pricing and that we will be more aggressive early on in pricing and try to get ahead of the curve as opposed to trying to smooth that out over a multiyear period. Mario or Glenn, anything you would add to that? Josh, I don't \u2013 we did not mean for it to have that interpretation. When you look at improving profitability in auto insurance, number one thing will be increased our rates. As the lowering expenses, as part of Mario said, the growth objective or transformed growth plan, that will obviously help, but we would have done that anyway. In fact, we started at like two or three years ago, and we're really glad we did it because we came into this year with, as Glenn pointed out, about 3 points lower than we would have been had we not started. But that's ongoing piece, but it's a component of improving profitability, but it's just not \u2013 not like we started in claim loss cost management is somewhere in between the two, you're always using data analytics and new claim processes, new relationships with vendors to try to reduce your cost. But as the cost change in the locus of those cost changes. Sometimes you have to adjust the programs you have in place \u2013 so I would say that the primary thing to focus on is rate increases in terms of the near-term improvement in auto profitability. Greg, I understand the need and desire to get to the math, and that's why we've added the monthly disclosure. Glenn, do you want to take the specifics on the slide? Greg, when we get to the \u2013 when we do the auto call in March, we'll give you a little more specifics on how to calculate that because the 2.9% is based on the \u2013 it's a dollar, right? We have a dollar number of what we think we're going to get. It's 2.9% is 2.9% times the prior year premiums. As the prior year premiums, if you look at the total, of course, when you're raising rates, it keeps going up, too. So the full year number is not the annualized number of December. So we'll help you figure out how to do that in March. Glenn, could you handle that? Greg, it's \u2013 the regulators come out of when they want to treat customers fairly. And as Glenn pointed out, the first thing they want is transparency, and our team spends a tremendous amount of time trying to be transparent with the regulators. It's also about what's your history with them. So we did a shelter and place payback of $1 billion. No regulator asked us or forces to do it. We did it proactively within my 10 days of noticing this guy here and his team got organized on it. So it's not like they do everything we want, but it's about treating customers fairly. And then in addition, when you're going in on the physical damage coverages, it's paid in 90 days. So there's not a great debate over whether the money went out or not. It just does. And then finally, injury, can be a little more discussion around it because there are longer-term trends, but we have good math on that as well. So we're confident we can get our combined ratio into the target level that Glenn talked about, which is in mid-90s. Glenn have some good math on that. Glenn, do you want to take that? Yes. It's hard to compare us to other people. If you're talking about Progressive, I'd say our combined ratio is 15 to 20 points better than theirs on a billions of dollars of either theirs or ours, but I don't even think there's a comparison. But \u2013 so we \u2013 the business bounces around a little bit. We get a good return on capital on it. Was it in the high 90s? Is that where we want it to be on a long-term basis? No. There's a bounce around by year, yes. And so we feel highly confident we can continue to differentiate ourselves in this space in that business. Good question. I understand why it's important because everybody is trying to figure out the turn and when will it be in the P&L so you can get in early. And I understand the same thing is when people are looking at sort of various rate increases. The headline would be, we're not going to give a projection as to when because you can't predict what will happen to frequency, severity, rate increases. What you can do is look on a longer-term basis and say, when you look at auto insurance and you look at the broad competitive set, Allstate Progressive and GEICO tend to outperform the industry and have combined ratios, which generate attractive returns and just \u2013 you can just graph it out over five or 10 years we all sort of hover in the same place. There are other people like some of the large mutuals and stuff which don't operate at that level, but we've proven an ability to get there. So we think that we'll continue to get there as to the speed of it. Sometimes people ask about the speed, is very idiosyncratic. Like, if your frequency moved up to near \u2013 closer to pre-pandemic levels, earlier than ours did, then you should have been taking price earlier and severities, the same thing, people manage their loss costs differently. So we tend to look at it and say, with the long term, we know how to make money in this business on how we're confident we'll get there. But we've not put a date out which we said we'll be in the mid-90s. Yes, it's a good question. And the percentage is sometimes get a little confusing because it's a percentage, in other words, it's absolute dollars is the way we reserve to it. Mario, do you want to talk about the reserve changes? So \u2013 and we do it by state and by coverage. I mean so if we \u2013 there's a fair amount of granularity to it, is market is not always as precise as you like because you're trying to guess what it's going to cost us settle to something. Well, thank you for participating. Let me just close by saying, there's two stories here. The narrower story is, it's about the insurance industry and Allstate dealing with auto insurance of profitability caused by inflation in fixing cars and then also fixing bodies. Great longer longitudinal story is, which I don't want to let it on the cutting of the floor is about a significant repositioning of the company while dealing with that issue. So we sold our life business. We spent $4 billion success with our National General into the fold increase our market share by 1%, which different position in the independent agent channel for transformation of the Allstate branded business is going quite well, whether that's expanding direct lowering costs or building out new products and improving our competitive position. And then our Protection Services business is really reached a substantive multibillion dollar level with large source of future revenue growth to come because of the way the time works. And at the same time, we're continuing to buy back shares and pay great dividends. So thank you all for participating, and we'll talk to the next quarter. Actually, we'll talk to you in March when we come back to auto reels."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Glenn. Let's move to Slide 10 and discuss how transformative growth positions us for long-term success. So as we've discussed on past calls, transformative growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by delivering on four-key objectives: improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing both the sophistication and investment in customer acquisition and deploying a new technology ecosystem. We made significant progress across each objective in 2021. Our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. By leveraging our industry-leading telematics offering as well as advanced data and analytics, we are able to redesign products to create competitively differentiated offerings for our customers. We have transformed our Allstate agent model to increase growth and decrease distribution costs. We've improved the strength of our direct channel through lower pricing and enhanced capabilities, and the acquisition of National General further improved our strategic position in the independent agent channel. Customer acquisition costs relative to lifetime value have improved with higher close rates and increased use of analytics to improve marketing effectiveness. As a result, we invested more in marketing in 2021. We also made progress on deploying the technology necessary to achieve transformative growth. New customer and product management ecosystems will improve ease of use and self-service capabilities at lower costs. We are using both purchased and proprietary software, which is currently in dark deployment before it is operationally tested this year. Delivering on each objective in an integrated way enables us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value. Turning to Slide 11. Let's look how transformative growth has already begun to successfully drive results in our Property-Liability business. In the chart on the left, you will see Property-Liability policies in force grew by 13.7% compared to the prior year quarter, driven predominantly by the National General acquisition. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4.2 million policies and Allstate brand Property-Liability policies increased 374,000, reflecting enhanced direct channel capabilities and growth in homeowners sold through Allstate agents. Property-Liability policies in force also grew organically by 1.5% from 37.5 million to 38.3 million in 2021, driven by contributions from growth in both the Allstate and National General brands, reflecting enhanced direct and independent agent capabilities. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of new issued applications for personal auto, which grew 61% compared to the prior year. The middle section of the chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which grew 4.3% compared to the prior year. Existing exclusive agents increased new business compared to the prior year, but that increase was offset by fewer appointments of new agents. As you know, we significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020 as we've been developing and deploying a new agent model to drive higher growth at a lower cost. The direct channel now represents 30% of new auto policies and grew by 28% compared to the prior year. This more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would historically have been generated by newly appointed agents. On the far right of the chart, you can see the significant impact of National General, which added 2 million applications in 2021. Slide 12 shows how Protection Services continues to generate profitable growth. Revenues, which exclude the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, increased 21.9% to $606 million in the quarter and increased 23.5% to $2.3 billion for the full-year 2021. The increase in revenues was driven by continued growth at Allstate Protection Plans and Arity. Allstate Protection Plans grew revenue by 23.8% and written premium by 49.1% for the full year 2021 compared to the prior year, driven by expanded products and partnerships, including the successful launch of the Home Depot relationship earlier in 2021. As written premium is earned over policy periods that can range from one to five years, it will continue to generate future revenue growth as we earn the $2 billion of unearned premium associated with Allstate Protection Plans on our balance sheet as of year-end. Arity expanded revenues by integrating lead cloud and transparently into its customer offerings, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition as well as increased device revenue, driven by growth in the Milewise product. Policies in force increased 8.9% to 148 million, primarily due to growth at Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $179 million for the full year 2021 represented an increase of $26 million compared to the prior year, driven by growth at Allstate Protection Plans. We will continue to invest in growing these businesses as they provide an attractive opportunity to both meet customer needs and create economic value for our shareholders. Let's move to Slide 13 and talk about the Allstate Health and Benefits segment, which generated growth and increased profit reflecting the National General acquisition. We've been offering voluntary benefits through the employer channel for over 20 years, and the acquisition of National General added both group and individual health products to our portfolio. These additions drove a significant increase in revenue with premiums and contract charges increasing 66.5% to the prior year. It also brought in a stream of $359 million of additional revenue, shown as other revenue on this slide, primarily from administrative fees and commissions from sales of nonproprietary health products. Adjusted net income more than doubled to $208 million in 2021 and as higher income from the National General acquisition was partially offset by a higher benefit ratio, reflecting higher life mortality in 2021 and lower benefit utilization in the prior year. Now let's move to Slide 14, which highlights our investment performance. Net investment income totaled $847 million in the quarter, which was $187 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $516 million in the quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting private equity appreciation and direct asset sales. As in prior quarters, we experienced broad-based private equity valuation increases. Several large idiosyncratic contributions \u2013 contributors meaningfully impacted results in the quarter with about 50% of performance-based investment income generated by 10 individual investments. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $7 million below the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing yield was largely mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. During 2021, the portfolio also generated more than $1 billion in net gains on investments and derivative instruments, including $428 million from valuation of market-based equity investments and $167 million of net gains from the performance-based portfolio, primarily from gains on sales of direct real estate investments. Our total portfolio return was 1.1% in the fourth quarter and 4.4% year-to-date, reflecting income and higher equity valuations, partially offset by higher interest rates. On the right, we've provided our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over various time horizons. Our total portfolio returns have been strong across these time periods with contributions from both our market-based and performance-based portfolios. The market-based portfolio delivers predictable earnings to support business needs with returns highly influenced by public markets. The performance-based portfolio is deployed against capital and longer liabilities and supplements market risk with idiosyncratic risk. Equity investments have higher long-term returns, which compensate investors for higher volatility, and we have sufficient capital to hold these assets through the full investment cycle. Our performance-based portfolio has experienced returns above our historical trend over the last several quarters. While prospective returns will depend on future economic and market conditions, we do expect these returns to moderate from last year's level. Now let's go to Slide 15 to discuss our proactive portfolio management. Our investment portfolio is a key contributor to shareholder value and is highly integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return processes. The divestiture of the life and annuity businesses reduced our portfolio from $94 billion at year-end 2020 to $65 billion today and provided us an opportunity to shift our asset allocation to increase risk-adjusted returns. Since most of these \u2013 of the assets backing our life and annuity business were fixed income securities, the divestiture lowered overall enterprise interest rate and credit risk. As a result, we increased our allocation to higher returning equity investments while maintaining the total amount of capital backing investment risks. As you can see from the bottom left, higher return public equity and performance-based investments now account for 23% of the overall portfolio. These investments do have more volatility than fixed income securities, so we allocate more capital to support them, but the higher return more than offset \u2013 more than offsets the risk of increased volatility, creating additional shareholder value. Over three-fourth of the portfolio is still fixed income securities, which generates consistent cash flow. The result is a higher returning portfolio with lower interest rate risk overall. We actively manage interest rate risk and consider how it impacts overall enterprise risk and return. As you can see in the blue bars on the right chart, we extended duration from 2018 to 2020 when interest rates shown in the orange line were declining. This mitigated the impact of lower interest rates on auto insurance prices and was a balanced risk and return position from an enterprise perspective. In 2021, we concluded that interest rates were not sufficiently compensating us for the risk that interest rates would rise, which would have a negative impact on the valuation of our bond portfolio. As you know, the consumer price index increased throughout 2021, shown by the light blue line on the chart, and we've discussed at length the impact that inflation has had on auto insurance margins. As a result, we shortened the duration of the fixed income portfolio through the sale of long corporate and municipal bonds and to a lesser extent, the use of derivatives. We are taking additional actions in 2022 to further reduce the negative impact higher interest rates would have on fixed income valuation. This will lower fixed income portfolio yield and investment income for the near term, but positions the portfolio to reinvest into higher rates if they continue to rise. Finally, let's move to Slide 16, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position. Allstate's capital position remains strong and enables significant cash returns to shareholders while investing in growth. We returned $4.1 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends in 2021. The common dividend was increased 50% compared to 2020, and common shares outstanding were reduced by 7.8% over the last 12 months. So if you held a share of stock at the beginning of 2020, you now own 7.8% more of the enterprise. As of year-end 2021, we had $3.3 billion remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by March 31, 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions. Okay. All right. Yes, Josh, this is Mario. Thanks for the question. I would agree with Tom, I think what we're focused on is permanent cost reductions that will on a sustained basis improve our competitive position and improve customer value and really enable profitable growth. And we're going to continue to focus on things like operating costs and distribution costs that we can permanently take out of the system. And as Tom mentioned, leveraging tools like automation, process redesign off-shoring where we can and really kind of implement plans that do take time and aren't the kinds of things that I think you can accelerate the execution of. But we're also not focused on ripping a bunch of costs out, that's just going to come back into the system. We want to make the cost reductions permanent, achieve the three points over time because that will really position us to grow and grow at really attractive returns going forward. Sure, Tom. So I guess the play side start is we have really strong reserving processes, and we're continually looking at our reserve levels, both for the current report year but also for prior years. And we're taking into account things that we're seeing, both in terms of inflationary trends as well as other phenomenon. And we talked a little bit earlier around things like medical inflation, consumption, attorney representation, those all factor in. So I think, David, the thing we saw this quarter was we continued to see upward development in prior years and some of the casualty coverages. And we took that into account this quarter in terms of raising our ultimate report year expectations for bodily injury in a couple of the prior years. But it was really in reaction to the continuation of some of those trends that I talked about that are causing bodily injury and other casualty severities to increase to levels that were beyond kind of the range of outcomes that we had established earlier on for those prior years. So we reacted to it. We tend to be conservative when we set reserves. But in this particular instance, we saw those trends develop out, and we reacted to it and increased the prior year reserves on auto casualty."

After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and we posted related materials to our website @allstateinvestors.com. our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and the investor supplement and forward-looking statements on Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2020 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Well, good morning and thank you for investing your time with us today. Let's start on Slide 2. This is Allstate strategy on the left-hand side, which we've talked about before. We have two components; increased personal profit liability market share, and expanded protection solutions. And those are the two ovals you see on the left with the intersection between. The key third quarter results are highlighted on the right-hand panel. Property-liability policies and force increased by 12.5%. Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by both broadening its product offering and expanding the network of retail providers. As a result, we now have almost a 192 million policies force across the [Indiscernible]. Financially, the results were more mixed. Revenues were up substantially, but net income and adjusted net income declined from the prior year quarter. Underwriting income declined primarily due to higher loss costs of settling auto insurance claims. We've implemented price increases to proactively respond to the sharp rise in loss costs and transformative growth continues to position us for long-term success, both of which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes. This was partially offset by the benefits from our long-term risk and return program that includes significant reinsurance recoverable, they were primarily related to Hurricane Ida, and a substantial increase in performance-based investment income. Capital deployment results were excellent with a billion-and-a-half dollars in cash return to shareholders in the quarter. We also completed the divestitures of our two largest life and annuity businesses, one in October and then one just earlier this week. So let's go to Slide 3. Revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 16.9% compared to the prior-year quarter. And that reflects both the higher earned premiums in National General acquisition. Allstate brand homeowners premium growth, and higher net investment income, property liability premiums, and policies and force increased 13.5%, and 12.5% respectively. Net investment income was $764 million, and that's up almost [Indiscernible] by $300 million compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting strong results from the performance-based portfolio. Net Income was $508 million in the quarter. And that's compared to a billion 1 in the prior quarter as lower underwriting income was partially offset by the higher investment income. Adjusted net income was $217 million or $0.73 per diluted share and decreased $683 million compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting the lower underwriting income due to the higher auto and homeowners insurance loss costs. Net income for the first 9 months of 2021 was below the prior year, and it's largely due to the loss on the sale of the life annuity business which we recorded earlier in the year. Adjusted net income was $10.70 per share for the first nine months. That was above the prior year as higher investment income and lower expenses, more than offset higher loss costs. Let's turn to slide 4. How I would do is put the pandemic in the longitudinal perspective because this created volatility for our results. And it obviously requires us to adapt quickly, which we do. But before we go through the impact on the third quarter results of the supply chain disruptions, let's talk about the initial and subsequent impact of the pandemic. So in 2020, the economic lockdown resulted in fewer miles being driven and promoted -- and prompted an aggressive economic support response from really governments around the world. The impact on auto insurance was a dramatic drop in the number of accidents. And of course, due to this unprecedented driving frequency, we've proactively provided our customers with some money back which increased customer retention. Since then, and since there was less road congestion and fewer accidents that occurred during commuting hours, the average speed in severity of auto claims increased, offsetting some of the frequency benefits. Nevertheless, underwriting margins improved dramatically, so we introduced a temporary shelter in place payback rather than take a permanent rate reduction, and took some modest overall reductions in rate level. This year, as you can see from the right-hand column, the story has been just the opposite as it relates to frequency, with large percentage increases. And while the overall level of accident frequency for the Allstate brand is still below pre -pandemic levels, the national and general non-standard business is back to the levels before the pandemic. Auto severity this year, however, has been dramatically impacted by the supply chain disruption and price increases on used cars and original equipment parts in Mario will take you through that in a couple of slides. From a pricing perspective, this results in moving from modest rate reductions to significant increases on auto insurance prices. From a growth standpoint at the off set of the pandemic, we begin to see material increase in the consumer acceptance to telematics. And we've really leaned into that with our Milewise product, which is really the only national product out there to pay for the mile. And that's led to substantial increase in debt telematics products. Now, the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the investment portfolio and this is a tale of the beginning of the end as well. So early in the crisis, equity valuations were down and it had a negative impact on investment results. Then of course, we have a broad-based long-term spread out over a decade, really investing in these kinds of funds. And so we do it on a long-term basis, whether that's 3, 5, or 10 years. But so what's happened this year, of course, is we've had the opposite happen, which is with the economic stimulus, we've had equity evaluations going after and our returns have come back strongly. In the market-based portfolio, lower interest rates at the onset of this pandemic did lead to an increase in the unrealized gains in the portfolio. But of course, what that does is reduce future interest rate income, which you see slight decline in this quarter. And many of our other businesses that have been impacted, some positively, some negatively. But it's our ability to adapt and seize the opportunities that are presented that create shareholder result So Mario will now go through the third quarter results in more detail and how transformative growth positions Allstate for continued success.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Let's move to Slide 5 to review property-liability margin results in the third quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses, as well as higher catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates. The chart at the bottom of the slide quantifies the impact of each component in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. As you can see, the personal auto underlying loss ratio drove most of the increase, due to higher auto accident frequency and the inflationary impacts on auto severity. Higher catastrophe losses shown in the middle of the chart, had a negative 1.4 impact on the combined ratio, as favorable reserve re-estimates recorded in 2020 from wildfires subrogation settlements, positively impacted the prior year quarter. Gross catastrophe losses were higher, but were reduced by nearly $1 billion of net reinsurance recoveries following Hurricane Ida, demonstrated the benefits of our long-term approach to risk and return management of the homeowners insurance business and our comprehensive reinsurance program. Non-catastrophe prior-year reserve strengthening of a $162 million in the quarter drove an adverse impact of 0.8 points, primarily from increases in auto and commercial lines. This also included $111 million of strengthening in the quarter related to asbestos, environmental, and other reserves in the runoff property-liability segment, following our annual comprehensive reserve review. This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio when excluding the impact of amortization of purchased intangibles, primarily due to lower restructuring and related charges compared to the prior-year quarter. Moving to Slide 6, let's go a bit deeper on auto insurance profitability. Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio finished at 97.5 for the quarter and 89.7 over the first 9 months of 2021. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects higher loss -- loss costs due to higher accident frequency, increased severity, and competitive pricing enhancements implemented in late 2020 and earlier this year. While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, we continue to experience favorable trends relative to pre -pandemic levels. Allstate brand auto property damage frequency increased 16.6% compared to 2020, but decreased 16.8% relative to 2019. The chart on the lower left compares the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2019 to this quarter, to remove some of the short-term pandemic volatility. The underlying combined ratio was 93.1 in 2019, which generates an attractive return on capital. Favorable auto frequency in the third quarter of 2021, lowered the combined ratio by 6.4 points compared to 2019. Increased auto claim severity, however, increased the combined ratio by 12 points versus 2 years ago, as you can see from the red bar. The cost reductions implemented as part of transformative growth, reduced expenses by 1.3 points, which favorably impacted 2021 results. As Tom mentioned, early in the pandemic, the severity increases were driven by higher average losses due to a reduction in low severity claims. This year, the increase reflects the impact of supply chain disruptions in the auto markets, which has increased used car prices and enabled original equipment manufacturers to significantly increased part prices. The chart on the lower right, shows used car values began increasing above the CPI in late 2020, which accelerated in 2021, resulting in an increase of 44% since the beginning of 2019. Similarly, OEM parts have also increased in 2021, roughly twice as much as core CPI. This has resulted in higher severities for both total loss vehicles and repairable vehicles. Since these increases were accelerating throughout the second and third quarters of the year, we Increased expected loss costs for the first 2 quarters of 2021. And this prior quarter strengthening shows up in the combined ratio for the third quarter. Increases in report year severities for auto insurance claims during the first two quarters of 2021, increased the third quarter combined ratio by 2.6 points, as you can see by the green bar on the lower left. So let's flip to Slide 7, which lays out the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability. As you can see from the chart on the top, Allstate has maintained industry-leading auto insurance margins over a long period of time with a combined ratio operating range in the mid-90s, exhibiting strong execution and operational expertise. To maintain industry-leading results, we are increasing rates, improving claims effectiveness, and continuing to lower costs. After lowering prices in early 2021 to reflect in part Allstate 's lower expense ratio, we have proactively been responding with increases in the third quarter with actions continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2022. The chart on the right provides selected rate increases already implemented in the third and Fourth Quarter, as well as publicly filed rates that have yet to be implemented in the Fourth Quarter. Those states denoted with a carrot, our top ten states in terms of written premium as of year-end 2020 in the third quarter we received rate approvals for increases in 12 states, primarily in September. We adapted quickly to higher severities in the Fourth Quarter with plans to file rates in an additional 20 states. We have already implemented rate increases in 8 states during the Fourth Quarter with an average increase of 6.7% 7% as of November first, looking ahead, we expect to pursue price increases in an additional 12 locations by year-end. We are working closely with state regulators to provide detailed support and decrease the lag time between filing, implementation, and premium generation. As we move into next year, it is likely auto insurance prices will continue to be increased to reflect higher severities. We also continue to leverage advanced claims capabilities and process efficiencies. Cost reductions as part of transformative growth will also continue to be implemented. Let's turn to slide 8 and discuss our expectations and commitment to further improve our cost structure through transformative growth. As you can see by the chart on the bottom of the slide, we've defined a new non-GAAP measure this quarter, referred to as the adjusted expense ratio. This starts with our underwriting expense ratio excluding restructuring, coronavirus related expenses, amortization, and impairment of purchased intangibles, and investments in advertising. It then also adds in our claim expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims, which tend to be more variable. We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-liability business. Through innovation and strong execution, we achieved 2.6 points of improvement when comparing 2020 to 2018 with further improvement occurring through the first 9 months of 2021. Over time, we expect to drive an additional three points of improvement from current levels achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024. This represents about a 6 point reduction relative to 2018 or an average of 1 point per year over 6 years, enabling an improved price position relative to our competitors. While maintaining attractive returns. Future cost reductions center around continued digital enhancements to automate processes enabling the retirement of legacy technology. Operating efficiency gains from combining organization, combining organizations and transforming the distribute -- the distribution model to higher growth and lower cost. Transitioning to slide 9, let's go up a level to show how transformative growth positions us for long-term success and how the components of transformative growth work together to create a flywheel of profitable growth. As you know, transformative growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal property - liability market share, by building a low cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, and deploying a new technology ecosystem. We've made significant progress to date, across each component. Starting at the top of the flywheel visual, our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. Enhancing and expanding distribution puts us in a position to take advantage of more affordable pricing. Increasing the analytical sophistication of new customer acquisitions let's cus -- let's consumers know about this better value proposition. New technology platforms' lower costs, has enable us to further broaden the solutions offered to property-liability customers. This flywheel will enable us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value. Turning to Slide 10, let's look at the changes to the distribution system, which are also underway. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, Property-liability policies in force grew by 12.5% compared to the prior-year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies and Allstate brand property liability policies increased by 231,000, driven by growth across personal lines. Allstate brand auto policies enforce increased slightly compared to the prior-year quarter. And sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, including growth of 142,000 policies compared to prior year-end. As you can see by the table on the lower left. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to the prior year. The middle section of the right chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 5% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. A 38% increase in the direct channel more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would have normally been generated by newly appointed agents. As you know, we significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020, since we are developing a new agent model to drive higher growth at lower-cost. The addition of National General also added 502 thousand new auto applications in the quarter. Let me now turn it over to Mark to cover the remainder of the slides before we move to Q&A.\nMark Nogal: Thanks Mario. Moving to Slide 11, protection services continues to grow revenue and profit. Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 23.3% to $597 million in the third quarter. Protection Plans, net written premium increased by a $139 million due to the launch of the Home Depot relationships, focusing on appliances. Our quarterly net written premium is now 5.5 times the level of when the Company was acquired in 2017. Already expanded revenues due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparently., which were acquired as part of the national general acquisition, as well as increased device sales driven by growth in the milewest product. Policies and force increased 12.5% to a 150 million driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate identity protection. Adjusted net income was $45 million in the third quarter, representing an increase of $5 million compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by higher profitability at Allstate identity protection in Arity. This was partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses related to investments and growth. Now let's shift to Slide 12, which highlights our investment performance. Net investment income totaled $764 million in the quarter, which was $300 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $437 million in the quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting increases in private equity investments. As in prior quarters, several large idiosyncratic contributors had a meaningful impact on our results. These results represent a long-term and broad approach to growth investing, with nearly 90% of year-to-date performance-based income coming from assets with inception years of 2018 and prior. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $6 million below the prior-year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield, was somewhat mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayments fee income. Our total portfolio return was 1% in the third quarter and 3.3% year-to-date, reflecting income and changes in equity valuations partially offset by higher interest rates. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit risk for appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return process, and play an important role in generating shareholder value. While the performance-based investment results continued to be strong in the third quarter, we manage the portfolio with a longer-term view on returns. On the right, we have provided our annualized portfolio return in total, and by strategy over various time horizons. Consistent with broader public and private equity markets, our portfolio has experienced returns above our historical trend over the last several quarters. While prospective returns will depend on future economic and market conditions, we do expect our performance-based returns to moderate in line with our longer-term results. Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate strong capital position. Allstate's balance sheet strength and excellent cash flow generation, provides strong cash returns to shareholders while investing in growth. Significant cash returns to shareholders, including $1.5 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends occurred during the third quarter. Common shares outstanding have been reduced by 5% over the last 12 months. Already in the fourth quarter we successfully completed the acquisition of safe auto on October 1st for $262 million to leverage National General's integration capabilities and further increased personal lines market share. We also recently closed on the divestitures of Allstate Life Insurance Company in New York. These divestitures free up approximately $1.7 billion of deployable capital, which was factored into the $5 billion share repurchase program currently being executed. Turning to Slide 14, let's finish with a longer-term view of Allstate's focus on execution, innovation, and sustainable value creation. Allstate has an excellent track record of serving customers, earning attractive returns on risks, and delivering for shareholders, as you can see by the industry-leading statistics on the upper right. Innovation is also critical to the execution, and our proactive implementation of transformative growth has positioned us well to address the macroeconomic challenges facing our business today and in the future. Sustainable value creation also requires excellent capital management and governance. As an example, Allstate is in the top 15% of S&P 500 companies and cash returns to shareholders by providing an attractive dividend and repurchasing 25% and 50% of outstanding shares over the last 5 and 10 years respectively. Execution, innovation, and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. With that context, let's open the line for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Josh Inc. from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nJoshua Shanker: Yes. Thank you. I want to talk about bundles and homeowners in the pricing of the dual engine of homeowners and auto together. I guess there's two things I want to understand. One is when a customer sees their overall bundled price going up, what does the conversation like, especially if you're trying to more centralized your business with a greater direct relationship with your customers. And 2, given Allstate's geographic footprint, can Allstate add incoming customers for homeowners without changing its cap footprint.\nTom Wilson: Good morning, Josh is Tom, I'll start and then Glenn can jump in first as you know, we've long been focused on bundling auto and homeowners because those are good, stable, long-term customers. You do get a discount for putting those two together. So there's an advantage to the customer from buying it and putting it all in one place besides just having 1 point of contact. And we've been good at that. If you look at our growth in Homeowners this year. It's higher than our growth in auto insurance. And data appears to be because we are doing more bundling of individual customers, it a little hard to get the exact attribution, but we feel good about what our agents are doing to drive that. As it relates to the Gross event. We've been we've repositioned as business over multiple years back in the middle -- late 2 thousand decade of 2,000, we've made of course a bunch of money since over the last eight or nine years, I think almost $9 billion of underwriting income on homeowners which you need to do because we don't believe that a 4 point margin is attractive for homeowners for a couple of reasons. One is you don't get much investment income. Secondly, you got to put up more capital because the results are more volatile and you have the big tail losses. So as we seek to grow it, we bring all of that math to bear. On individual states is where we grow. And so if there's a state where even if there's a fair amount of catastrophe exposure but we think we can get a good return, that's got a margin on it that compensates us for the capital we have to put up and the reinsurance we have to buy, then we'll do that. And we're highly sophisticated in the way we run it. So the geographic focus is really -- we have a much highly sophisticated model into it. On the direct business, you don't sell as much direct homeowners right now, we still need to crack the code on that. Before I -- Glenn will have some view on how we can continue to run the table in homeowners as we have so far. But the -- an upcoming thing that Glenn might want to touch on, is what we're doing in the independent agent channel because of the National General platform gives us, with our products, our expertise, our pricing, our claims management. And our reinsurance programs gives us the ability to really serve a lot of customers. [Indiscernible]\nJoshua Shanker: Glenn, where [Indiscernible] I just want to say, can you address retention and cat footprints as well?\nTom Wilson: Yeah. Glenn, mind if you take both of those?\nGlenn Shapiro: Sure. So a few comments on homeowners leading into it, but we got a really strong home care business and so we want to grow it, and we want to handle it as Tom said. So, over the course of the past year, we've deepened bundling discounts. So we've made it more attractive for customers across 30 states. We've shifted our agency competition over the last couple of years to where it's more attractive for them to bundle. And the same is true in direct, as Tom said, we're looking to crack the code right board there. Were writing some, We want to write more, and so some of the incentives for our direct team around cross quoting and bundling. To the point around that footprint, We're in good shape. Like, if you look at our ability to write business, we can write it pretty broadly. We can write in some CAT-prone areas, but we tend to offset it and create the diversity of our book by writing in other areas. I mean, right now, we're on a 12-month view right now, we're at 93.8 combined ratio made about $400 million underwriting profit in the last 12 months, in spite of having some really big CAT quarters. Though it's a good business that we're able to consistently make money in, and so we're looking to grow it. But as Tom said, we have -- we have pretty stringent guidelines, that where we write, how we write so that we don't overgrown in CAT prone areas. But we're able to grow without that and Tom mentioned something that I want to come back to. In terms of the breadth of our distribution and growing and that would be into our IA channel. You know, the IA channel is a huge opportunity. Independent agents where a lot of homeowners and our National General and Allstate's Company, as it will be branded, is adding our middle market products, both auto and home. And we have sort of a whole new Greenfield there to run in. And that would be a broad geographic spread, not just the cat prone areas.\nTom Wilson: Hey [Indiscernible] let me just ask that because I think I understand why you're trying to triangulate between what's going on in the industry. First, we don't have a catastrophe exposure problem. We don't have a profitability problem. We believe in homeowners. We only made about -- we lost about $16 million bucks and $7.3 billion so far this year. So we'd like to make more money, but as Glenn pointed out, when you look over a longer period of time, we've had a fair amount of ups and downs, but we still make underwriting profit sense of 12-month basis. So we don't have a catastrophe problem. So we don't have to restrict stuff and end up with -- what you're poking at is retention issues. We have been there and done that though And it was called the repositioning we did in the latter part of the decade I mentioned. And when you call a customer and say, I used to have -- you used to be insured with us and now I am not going to insure your thoughts and we were one of the biggest brokers have homeowners insurance products. I think in the country and maybe Vegas. And through our advantage in even when you say to people, here's another Company. It has some impact on your auto business. So because people are like, Well, I'll take my business someplace else or competitors decide they want to, they want to bundle and they'll go get those customers as well. We had some issues with auto growth when we were downsizing. We went down by 2 million policies in the homeowner's business over a 4, 5 year-period. It does hurt. It's manageable. I can't speak for what our competitors are going to do. What I do know is what Glenn said, which is we got a good business, we know how to run it. We have growth opportunities, and we're looking forward to serving more customers and make more money for our shareholders along the way.\nJoshua Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. I'd like to turn your attention to Page 7, and I was particularly struck by your chart where you've identified the rate increases you've deployed, and then ones that you're going to be implementing. And I was wondering if you could provide us some perspective on -- given the fact that severity has been so substantial, where you think that's going to go with other states? It feels like this is going to be an ongoing reset of pricing as we go through most of next year. And against that backdrop, just how you think about your competitive positioning when most of the industry is going to be raising rates.\nTom Wilson: Let me -- maybe -- let me start and then, Glenn, why don't you jump in on what you are doing individually. I think you are right about that. There seems to be this -- a threat going through the markets today. And this is kind of a once and done. And we don't necessarily see it that way. I mean, I think there's never bold enough to decide in claim, we're ahead or of anybody else. Because firstly, I'd assumes everybody is in the same place. Secondly, assumes the same trends are going to happen and third is that those trends are going to end and the answer is we don't know when they will do. What we do know is what we can do differently. And we do know that some of our competitors had frequency increases sooner than we did so that you would expect them to raise prices sooner than we did. We do think that we have a good plan in place and Glenn can take you through that, which is to make sure we get attractive returns in auto insurance, which is a key component of what we do in terms of delivering value for shareholders. We are all over that and we will go -- where -- how that will move forward in terms of competitive position. And that's also hard to tell, what I do know is that I'm really glad we started transformative growth 2 years ago. And the cost reductions we already have in place certainly have benefited us. It's positioned us to be able to grow through many different venues, so we can dial growth up if we choose to do that. I'm really glad we are where we are and we're positioned to take share in the future, which of course, our strategy. But we want to do that profitably. Glenn, do you want to talk about your plans getting the auto insurance returns back to where they have been historically?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. Absolutely. So thanks, Greg. And you hit a couple of important points that you're right about that everyone or close to everyone is going to have to take rate. When you talk about competitive position. So we think about that as part of process. But this is broad and this is going to be around for a while, like everything you look at in terms of what the root causes of severity, which is in its simplest terms, is the price of used cars. I would like to talk about collision coverage as it's a coverage that doesn't really have a policy limit that's dated other than the value of the vehicle itself. So in real turn, our policy limit on that coverage went up by 40% plus with no change in premium. And that experience happened to everybody across the industry. So it's a rarity where you have something is Clean and clean as that that is a root cause to your severity changes. So we think it will be around for a bit and we're going after rate to address that has one of the levers and we've talked about our claims capabilities and certainly our expense reductions as other ones. So in the third quarter, we took 12 price increases that went effective in the third quarter and other 8 in the fourth quarter so far with more to come. So this is broad and we'll be doing it just about everywhere. And I think the key from a competitive position is that we made a lot progress. So our starting point, we made significant progress over the last year with the expenses we've taken out, and therefore the competitive position we were in improved significantly. Our close rates improved significantly, leading to some of the greater new business that you saw. And so as we take rates and other due. It's our goal certainly keep that competitive position gain that we've made. But the primary goal is to get our margins back to where they need to be. And that's why we're going after rate, we're doing it pretty proactively.\nGreg Peters: Great. Thanks for the color on that. I wanted to pivot to Slide 8, which is, I think another really important slide in your presentation. And just to step back and recognize the long-term objective that you've introduced is pretty striking. I feel like when we get to 2024, if you've achieved that objective, that will put you clearly among the leaders in terms of a lowest adjusted expense ratio in the marketplace. I'm sure a lot of thought went into this. Can you give us some more color on where the improvement, where you're going to get the most leverage in terms of the expense ratio improvements, where it's going to come from. And then maybe also include some comments on the advertising expense because that's not included in this.\nTom Wilson: Mario, do you want to start with the components of the cost reduction and now come back to advertisement?\nMario Rizzo: Sure. So Greg, thanks for the question and the acknowledgement of the progress we've made. I guess, why it start is maybe to just kind of go up a level and reiterate again what our objective in reducing costs really is, which is to enhance customer value by improving our competitive price position. And we're going to do that by continuing to drive down the expense component of our combined ratio, which is inclusive of both underwriting and claim expenses and to your point, we've made really good progress over the past several years. And in addition to the progress we've made, we've created plans and have line of sight to the additional 3-point objective that we've got by 2024, by focusing on things like digitizing processes to improve efficiency by continuing -- as we do that, create opportunity to retire legacy technology to capture the synergies associated with the National General acquisition, to continue to drive down distribution costs as we've talked about creating a more productive but lower-cost distribution model. So we've got opportunity in both the -- from an operating cost perspective and both the underwriting and the claim side. And we've got a plan on how to get there, and that's why we established a goal and we think once we can get the additional 3 points out of our cost structure, it's really going to position us well relative to our competitors, to have a more competitive price point, to deliver higher customer value and really position ourselves to accelerate growth.\nTom Wilson: So let me go to advertising then. Let me start with we didn't do transformative growth because of the pandemic, but boy, I am sure glad we got started on transformative growth when we did because we were able to reposition the brand. We invested over $250 million in repositioning the brand, do advertising, testing out new, more sophisticated ways to do it. And we did it when frequency was low, so we were able to use some of that reduction in frequency, the margin it's created, to invest in long-term growth by repositioning the brand. When you look at transfer on breast for a simple right, you get a more competitive price, you have more places to buy it. You let people know about that the increase in advertising, that or restocking that. What we do in the future will be depending how much we want to grow. So as we move forward, I think our advertising will be flat or come down some, because we want to make sure we've got the pricing right. The point that came up earlier about the longevity of the how long will severity keep come up. You want to make sure you've got that pricing right before you go out and get that flywheel going by doing more advertising. That said, we're always going to do a lot of advertising because as you know, it is a marketing war really out there between some of the large players. But the other part that's not as well known is it's getting every bit as sophisticated as auto insurance in home prices. You really got to be good with your math and whether it's upper funnel, lower funnel, getting the right price to the right customer, at the right time, in the right space is complicated. And so the other thing we've been working on is building out the sophistication, so that every dollar of advertising investment we spend is well done. The reason we took it out of the expense ratio guidance was because it is more volatile and it has penned down on what kind of growth we're looking to achieve in that quarter. And this is a measure of really how effectively running the business, like how are you keeping your costs down for your customers see can't hit at competitive price.\nGreg Peters: Thank you for your answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of a Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nElyse Greenspan: All right, thanks. Good morning. My first question was on the growth in new business that you guys saw in direct in the quarter. I know from commentary, you guys started to take price during the quarter and then more is on the [Indiscernible], but I was a little bit surprised with the level of growth you saw there, given the increase, the loss trend that you're mentioning. Can you expand upon that? And would you expect a new business growth on the direct side to slow as you push for additional ways through this system?\nTom Wilson: Elyse, let me give that to Glenn and just -- but Glenn and his team have done a fabulous job in getting us better at direct. Some of the growth that you see is because of the advertisement we talked about, some of the growth you see is we're just getting a lot better at it. And so once we put the Allstate brand on in Glenn study to combine capabilities. We've just -- we're getting much more effective at what we've closed on, and what we've closed in the cost. Glenn when you want to talk about the prospects for address?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yeah. I agree there any Tom just said I think we've got really nice prospect because I would say we're making up ground in dog years because we have what we're 20 years newer at doing directed the Allstate brands and some of our competitors. But we're making up chunks of that capability as we move a year-and-a-half into the launching with Allstate brand in direct. The effectiveness of our sales, whether it be our call centers, or on the web, etc., our marketing sophistication, our partners with marketing, all of those things getting better and that helps move it up. The other thing is, actually in this price environment that's going to be disrupted, we're really likely to see some tailwind in new business, but some headwind in retention. Because if we were in a situation where we're the only ones taking rate, you might expect the opposite. But with a whole bunch of people having to take rate that will create a lot of shoppers, we'll create shoppers of our own too, because it disrupts our own customers. And when people shop, they often find a better price for situation. Even in a rising environment like this. So there will be a lot of customers shopping, ours, and other companies. And so, it's an opportunity as Tom said, to leverage what we did and say we're really happy we did transformative growth when we did because we have more ways for customers to buy when that disruptive market happens.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question on, just in terms of rate, I believe the majority of your auto policies is six months, so correct me if I'm wrong there, but as we think about the rate going to this system, what you've done in the third quarter, the fourth quarter, and expectations for next year. How long would you -- do you think it will take to get back to your target margins, is it kind of a 6 month to 12 months situation? I know you don't have a specific target margins for Property-liability. We've gone to an overall awry, but we think about putting your margins at an acceptable level that we think that that would come over the next 6 to 12 months or can you give us the time range there?\nTom Wilson: I don't think you can do a time range on it, because I don't think we can predict what's going to happen in the future on the inflationary pressures. What we can do is say, we're going to go at this aggressively as soon as we can get there. That will be -- we're going to hustle as Glenn to get it. Well, as he said, his priority is auto insurance margins on that part of the business. We got lots of other priorities to look at. But when you look at inflation, I'm not in the camp that the inflationary, like used car prices are suddenly going to go back down. I think you buy a car for $14,000 and use a cost of $10,000, Like, you're not thinking it's worth $10,000 no matter what the Fed and everybody else thinks about it being transitory. I think the same thing is true with when you look at parts prices. Parts prices, it's not like the oil market where prices are -- the system is built to go up and down everyday, it gets embedded in there. The dealers buy inventories, people, distributors buy inventory, they price that. So we don't really see that being transitory and coming down. How long it will take to work all the way through the system, what opportunities the OEs will take to push prices farther up Is really unknown at this part. So it's hard to determine when they will cross, what you do know is at least in it's half-life, just going to keep going up. As long as we see movement in the bottom line. And it will keep going up until the bottom-line plans out, that being the bottom line is being lost cost. And that top-line then will keep going past their point in time until we get back to the margins. But when we get back to the same underwriting margin on a dollar basis, or a percentage basis on auto insurance. You can't really predict until you can have a better handle on where frequency [Indiscernible]. Glenn, anything you would add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: I know that the only thing I would add would be that the tactical answer on the rates, because completely agree. We don't know what the bottom line will do exactly, so we'll have to keep moving those and adjust. But the tactical answer on the rates, you're correct, Elyse, its 6 months in almost all of our states and all of our policy. So it's about 6 months from the effective date to get all customers paying that. And then another 6 months from the point they start paying it to where the full premium has been earnings for one policy period. So you really start to see the effect of the rates starting at the beginning of the year, but more impactfully in the second and third quarters of next year.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks, good morning, everybody. I think Glenn answered this question, but just want to be sure. I'm going to ask First Quarter, Second Quarter you were taking some targeted rate costs and now you're not. And I think Glenn said rate increases that are going to continue are going to be I think you said just about everywhere. I Just want to confirm that because I guess the question would be, how much of an overlap would there be in states where you took previous rate cuts -- pretty recent rate cuts, and now moving upward in those same states, is there overlap there in those states? I'm asking because of what that means to consumer impact on maybe retentions, seeing gyrations down and back up again. And then also if there is overlap there, what it means for, just something that Tom said, make sure we have pricing rates to confidence around our current rates.\nTom Wilson: Glenn do you want to take that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Sure. So the short answer to your question would be yes, there will be increases in places where there were modest decreases. I do think we waited a little while to really see what was happening with the frequency and ensure that it was long-standing and has remained a long-standing benefit before taking them. And we were modest and we've done some pretty significant givebacks into shelter in place, get it back, which were one-time and not sort of durable discount. Actually changing rates and moving them down, we were more subtle with and more modest with. I don't think people will see a wild swing down and backup, but they will see it in same-state. And the simple fact is, as you saw on the chart, I believe just on page -- bottom page 7, that used car prices spiked dramatically in the second quarter. And those spike, and then people start having claims. And then those claims start to be paid, working their way into the loss costs, and you have this hyper inflationary environment on auto physical damage lines. So it's just the appropriate response at the appropriate time for it. And we'll do everything we can to maintain our retention. It's one of the wonderful things -- one of the many wonderful things about our agency force. Our agency force do a really good job of building relationships and talking customers through changes in their policies, and helping us through things like this.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Thank you very much for that. The second question, a different one on Arity. I guess I'm curious how you think about Arity. Do you think of it as either a more of a use it for our own pricing and telematics business, or that plus [Indiscernible] it off to others and having more of a income-generating machine? It's still not giving you a lot of lift on that second piece, but do you think of it more that way longer-term? And we've seen more and more Companies go the route. You are about the only one that isn't. the go the route of farming that business off, Hartford just announced that recently were they farmed it off, and more and more companies are doing that. So how do you think about Arity? Is it more just for your own pricing or do you want to have it be more of a, again, an income generating machine as well?\nTom Wilson: Michael, thank you for asking about something other than auto insurance margins, because we have a lot of good things going on, one of which is Arity, which a significant value has been created with Arity, both in the insurance business and outside the insurance business. And I don't think that's been reviewed by any analysts as if it was a separate Company. I mean, we have 600 billion miles of data. We risk scoring the operation. We help people do marketing, more effectively and efficiently. And so we're really building quite a platform that will do a number of things. One is it does exactly what you've talked about, which is -- and the way we started, it was telematics as a service for us. We needed somebody to collect the data. We needed to get a mobile app up. We needed to put it in files and be able to do something with it. And so rather than do that inside the insurance Company, we decided to do it outside the insurance Company because we said this is -- at the point, we said this is Basically a service at other insurance companies will need and we can provide to them and we do. So. Arity provides that service to some other insurance companies, and we're working to try to expand that effort for them. But it moved beyond what I would just call telematics as a service, help me pull data in to figure out all my customers are doing too. We started collecting more data from ourselves and built a rating service organization so that we can help other insurance companies use telematics to price the insurance. We believe that they're going to get their capability anyway. So we think that we might as well do it through Arity, and capture addition -- additional margin, rather than just assumed that we can take over a 100% of the insurance industry. But being a leader in telematics, which we are, but we don't think we can get the entire market share. So we created a rating services organization around that. It's then been expanded to include really lead generation. As we started collecting more data. So we have data from the Allstate customers, we have data because we have our SDK embedded in other people's thoughts. We have had data and I think it's over 25 million cars were pulling every day, really high fidelity data that's in the same format. We also buy data that we're able to combine with that 25 million on an over another 75 million current. So we're pulling data on a 100 million cars per day right now. And so we're building this rating services organization for all state and other insurers so that we can not only do telematics to the servers. We can do that. We think we can actually work to help people pre -qualify buyers and it's called the Arity IQ. So significant value has been created. I don't think that shows up in shareholder value today because I don't really see any of the analysts really looking hard and saying what's it worth, but we think it's substantial value and we expect to continue to grow their business and expand its total addressable market.\nMichael Phillips: Okay Tom. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on, I think it was Slide 7, where you show the around a 7% rate increase that you are asking for. I guess that feels high to me, especially considering that the loss ratio, if I take out the reserve charge, was only about 1.5 points higher than the third quarter of 2019. And then also, considering the expense initiatives that you guys have taken to-date, I guess my thought was -- I thought that the expense plan would maybe help reduce the amount of rate that you guys would need to take. I guess -- is that the right way of thinking about it or is it too uncertain at this time and you guys just want to get in front of what might be coming down the road in terms of future loss cost increases?\nTom Wilson: Well, it's an accurate call-out, David, that the future expense reductions will certainly help us manage profitability. But we're increasing the price is now because we do want to grow profitably. But being unclear as to where this inflation will sort out, we're being what we think is fair and appropriate, as opposed to overlay aggressive in increasing prices now. As to the extent in the future, we don't need that as much in our expenses come down. Then we can improve our competitive position, which we've been -- we've improved our competitive position pretty significantly in 2021. and we don't want to give that up. And we'd like to continue to improve it as so we get that flywheel of growth going. But in this case, we're using the expense reductions for future competitive price improvement as opposed to saying, we don't need to raise prices because loss costs are [Indiscernible] Glenn or Mario anything you would add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: The only thing I'd add is, it is -- it is pretty easy to get negative rates in approved and in market very quickly. And as we talked about in one of the prior answers, it takes time for them to earn in. So we're projecting future loss costs out over the course of the next year and years and taking rate that we think best reflects our best estimates of what we're going to need to deliver the right returns. So it would be a good situation to get into to where we were we slightly overshot and could dial it back. But as Tom said, there's a lot of questions still on where this severity will -- Inflation for severity will end.\nTom Wilson: At some point, Glenn. Look, we need to make money in auto insurance, David, and we're going to do that. I think we're out of time, so let me just say as we move forward, you should expect us, as you've heard throughout this call, to focus on improving returns in auto insurance. At the same time, we're not letting up on any of the components of increasing our market share and personal property-liability, or expanding circle of protection. All of which we've had really good progress and success on this year and in this quarter, so you should expect us to continue to focus on a broad-based approach to increasing shareholder value. So thank you for your engagement with us again, and we will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation at today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Glenn Shapiro",
            "content": "Sure. So a few comments on homeowners leading into it, but we got a really strong home care business and so we want to grow it, and we want to handle it as Tom said. So, over the course of the past year, we've deepened bundling discounts. So we've made it more attractive for customers across 30 states. We've shifted our agency competition over the last couple of years to where it's more attractive for them to bundle. And the same is true in direct, as Tom said, we're looking to crack the code right board there. Were writing some, We want to write more, and so some of the incentives for our direct team around cross quoting and bundling. To the point around that footprint, We're in good shape. Like, if you look at our ability to write business, we can write it pretty broadly. We can write in some CAT-prone areas, but we tend to offset it and create the diversity of our book by writing in other areas. I mean, right now, we're on a 12-month view right now, we're at 93.8 combined ratio made about $400 million underwriting profit in the last 12 months, in spite of having some really big CAT quarters. Though it's a good business that we're able to consistently make money in, and so we're looking to grow it. But as Tom said, we have -- we have pretty stringent guidelines, that where we write, how we write so that we don't overgrown in CAT prone areas. But we're able to grow without that and Tom mentioned something that I want to come back to. In terms of the breadth of our distribution and growing and that would be into our IA channel. You know, the IA channel is a huge opportunity. Independent agents where a lot of homeowners and our National General and Allstate's Company, as it will be branded, is adding our middle market products, both auto and home. And we have sort of a whole new Greenfield there to run in. And that would be a broad geographic spread, not just the cat prone areas. Yes. Absolutely. So thanks, Greg. And you hit a couple of important points that you're right about that everyone or close to everyone is going to have to take rate. When you talk about competitive position. So we think about that as part of process. But this is broad and this is going to be around for a while, like everything you look at in terms of what the root causes of severity, which is in its simplest terms, is the price of used cars. I would like to talk about collision coverage as it's a coverage that doesn't really have a policy limit that's dated other than the value of the vehicle itself. So in real turn, our policy limit on that coverage went up by 40% plus with no change in premium. And that experience happened to everybody across the industry. So it's a rarity where you have something is Clean and clean as that that is a root cause to your severity changes. So we think it will be around for a bit and we're going after rate to address that has one of the levers and we've talked about our claims capabilities and certainly our expense reductions as other ones. So in the third quarter, we took 12 price increases that went effective in the third quarter and other 8 in the fourth quarter so far with more to come. So this is broad and we'll be doing it just about everywhere. And I think the key from a competitive position is that we made a lot progress. So our starting point, we made significant progress over the last year with the expenses we've taken out, and therefore the competitive position we were in improved significantly. Our close rates improved significantly, leading to some of the greater new business that you saw. And so as we take rates and other due. It's our goal certainly keep that competitive position gain that we've made. But the primary goal is to get our margins back to where they need to be. And that's why we're going after rate, we're doing it pretty proactively. Yeah. I agree there any Tom just said I think we've got really nice prospect because I would say we're making up ground in dog years because we have what we're 20 years newer at doing directed the Allstate brands and some of our competitors. But we're making up chunks of that capability as we move a year-and-a-half into the launching with Allstate brand in direct. The effectiveness of our sales, whether it be our call centers, or on the web, etc., our marketing sophistication, our partners with marketing, all of those things getting better and that helps move it up. The other thing is, actually in this price environment that's going to be disrupted, we're really likely to see some tailwind in new business, but some headwind in retention. Because if we were in a situation where we're the only ones taking rate, you might expect the opposite. But with a whole bunch of people having to take rate that will create a lot of shoppers, we'll create shoppers of our own too, because it disrupts our own customers. And when people shop, they often find a better price for situation. Even in a rising environment like this. So there will be a lot of customers shopping, ours, and other companies. And so, it's an opportunity as Tom said, to leverage what we did and say we're really happy we did transformative growth when we did because we have more ways for customers to buy when that disruptive market happens. I know that the only thing I would add would be that the tactical answer on the rates, because completely agree. We don't know what the bottom line will do exactly, so we'll have to keep moving those and adjust. But the tactical answer on the rates, you're correct, Elyse, its 6 months in almost all of our states and all of our policy. So it's about 6 months from the effective date to get all customers paying that. And then another 6 months from the point they start paying it to where the full premium has been earnings for one policy period. So you really start to see the effect of the rates starting at the beginning of the year, but more impactfully in the second and third quarters of next year. Sure. So the short answer to your question would be yes, there will be increases in places where there were modest decreases. I do think we waited a little while to really see what was happening with the frequency and ensure that it was long-standing and has remained a long-standing benefit before taking them. And we were modest and we've done some pretty significant givebacks into shelter in place, get it back, which were one-time and not sort of durable discount. Actually changing rates and moving them down, we were more subtle with and more modest with. I don't think people will see a wild swing down and backup, but they will see it in same-state. And the simple fact is, as you saw on the chart, I believe just on page -- bottom page 7, that used car prices spiked dramatically in the second quarter. And those spike, and then people start having claims. And then those claims start to be paid, working their way into the loss costs, and you have this hyper inflationary environment on auto physical damage lines. So it's just the appropriate response at the appropriate time for it. And we'll do everything we can to maintain our retention. It's one of the wonderful things -- one of the many wonderful things about our agency force. Our agency force do a really good job of building relationships and talking customers through changes in their policies, and helping us through things like this. The only thing I'd add is, it is -- it is pretty easy to get negative rates in approved and in market very quickly. And as we talked about in one of the prior answers, it takes time for them to earn in. So we're projecting future loss costs out over the course of the next year and years and taking rate that we think best reflects our best estimates of what we're going to need to deliver the right returns. So it would be a good situation to get into to where we were we slightly overshot and could dial it back. But as Tom said, there's a lot of questions still on where this severity will -- Inflation for severity will end."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Well, good morning and thank you for investing your time with us today. Let's start on Slide 2. This is Allstate strategy on the left-hand side, which we've talked about before. We have two components; increased personal profit liability market share, and expanded protection solutions. And those are the two ovals you see on the left with the intersection between. The key third quarter results are highlighted on the right-hand panel. Property-liability policies and force increased by 12.5%. Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by both broadening its product offering and expanding the network of retail providers. As a result, we now have almost a 192 million policies force across the [Indiscernible]. Financially, the results were more mixed. Revenues were up substantially, but net income and adjusted net income declined from the prior year quarter. Underwriting income declined primarily due to higher loss costs of settling auto insurance claims. We've implemented price increases to proactively respond to the sharp rise in loss costs and transformative growth continues to position us for long-term success, both of which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes. This was partially offset by the benefits from our long-term risk and return program that includes significant reinsurance recoverable, they were primarily related to Hurricane Ida, and a substantial increase in performance-based investment income. Capital deployment results were excellent with a billion-and-a-half dollars in cash return to shareholders in the quarter. We also completed the divestitures of our two largest life and annuity businesses, one in October and then one just earlier this week. So let's go to Slide 3. Revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 16.9% compared to the prior-year quarter. And that reflects both the higher earned premiums in National General acquisition. Allstate brand homeowners premium growth, and higher net investment income, property liability premiums, and policies and force increased 13.5%, and 12.5% respectively. Net investment income was $764 million, and that's up almost [Indiscernible] by $300 million compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting strong results from the performance-based portfolio. Net Income was $508 million in the quarter. And that's compared to a billion 1 in the prior quarter as lower underwriting income was partially offset by the higher investment income. Adjusted net income was $217 million or $0.73 per diluted share and decreased $683 million compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting the lower underwriting income due to the higher auto and homeowners insurance loss costs. Net income for the first 9 months of 2021 was below the prior year, and it's largely due to the loss on the sale of the life annuity business which we recorded earlier in the year. Adjusted net income was $10.70 per share for the first nine months. That was above the prior year as higher investment income and lower expenses, more than offset higher loss costs. Let's turn to slide 4. How I would do is put the pandemic in the longitudinal perspective because this created volatility for our results. And it obviously requires us to adapt quickly, which we do. But before we go through the impact on the third quarter results of the supply chain disruptions, let's talk about the initial and subsequent impact of the pandemic. So in 2020, the economic lockdown resulted in fewer miles being driven and promoted -- and prompted an aggressive economic support response from really governments around the world. The impact on auto insurance was a dramatic drop in the number of accidents. And of course, due to this unprecedented driving frequency, we've proactively provided our customers with some money back which increased customer retention. Since then, and since there was less road congestion and fewer accidents that occurred during commuting hours, the average speed in severity of auto claims increased, offsetting some of the frequency benefits. Nevertheless, underwriting margins improved dramatically, so we introduced a temporary shelter in place payback rather than take a permanent rate reduction, and took some modest overall reductions in rate level. This year, as you can see from the right-hand column, the story has been just the opposite as it relates to frequency, with large percentage increases. And while the overall level of accident frequency for the Allstate brand is still below pre -pandemic levels, the national and general non-standard business is back to the levels before the pandemic. Auto severity this year, however, has been dramatically impacted by the supply chain disruption and price increases on used cars and original equipment parts in Mario will take you through that in a couple of slides. From a pricing perspective, this results in moving from modest rate reductions to significant increases on auto insurance prices. From a growth standpoint at the off set of the pandemic, we begin to see material increase in the consumer acceptance to telematics. And we've really leaned into that with our Milewise product, which is really the only national product out there to pay for the mile. And that's led to substantial increase in debt telematics products. Now, the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the investment portfolio and this is a tale of the beginning of the end as well. So early in the crisis, equity valuations were down and it had a negative impact on investment results. Then of course, we have a broad-based long-term spread out over a decade, really investing in these kinds of funds. And so we do it on a long-term basis, whether that's 3, 5, or 10 years. But so what's happened this year, of course, is we've had the opposite happen, which is with the economic stimulus, we've had equity evaluations going after and our returns have come back strongly. In the market-based portfolio, lower interest rates at the onset of this pandemic did lead to an increase in the unrealized gains in the portfolio. But of course, what that does is reduce future interest rate income, which you see slight decline in this quarter. And many of our other businesses that have been impacted, some positively, some negatively. But it's our ability to adapt and seize the opportunities that are presented that create shareholder result So Mario will now go through the third quarter results in more detail and how transformative growth positions Allstate for continued success. Good morning, Josh is Tom, I'll start and then Glenn can jump in first as you know, we've long been focused on bundling auto and homeowners because those are good, stable, long-term customers. You do get a discount for putting those two together. So there's an advantage to the customer from buying it and putting it all in one place besides just having 1 point of contact. And we've been good at that. If you look at our growth in Homeowners this year. It's higher than our growth in auto insurance. And data appears to be because we are doing more bundling of individual customers, it a little hard to get the exact attribution, but we feel good about what our agents are doing to drive that. As it relates to the Gross event. We've been we've repositioned as business over multiple years back in the middle -- late 2 thousand decade of 2,000, we've made of course a bunch of money since over the last eight or nine years, I think almost $9 billion of underwriting income on homeowners which you need to do because we don't believe that a 4 point margin is attractive for homeowners for a couple of reasons. One is you don't get much investment income. Secondly, you got to put up more capital because the results are more volatile and you have the big tail losses. So as we seek to grow it, we bring all of that math to bear. On individual states is where we grow. And so if there's a state where even if there's a fair amount of catastrophe exposure but we think we can get a good return, that's got a margin on it that compensates us for the capital we have to put up and the reinsurance we have to buy, then we'll do that. And we're highly sophisticated in the way we run it. So the geographic focus is really -- we have a much highly sophisticated model into it. On the direct business, you don't sell as much direct homeowners right now, we still need to crack the code on that. Before I -- Glenn will have some view on how we can continue to run the table in homeowners as we have so far. But the -- an upcoming thing that Glenn might want to touch on, is what we're doing in the independent agent channel because of the National General platform gives us, with our products, our expertise, our pricing, our claims management. And our reinsurance programs gives us the ability to really serve a lot of customers. [Indiscernible] Yeah. Glenn, mind if you take both of those? Hey [Indiscernible] let me just ask that because I think I understand why you're trying to triangulate between what's going on in the industry. First, we don't have a catastrophe exposure problem. We don't have a profitability problem. We believe in homeowners. We only made about -- we lost about $16 million bucks and $7.3 billion so far this year. So we'd like to make more money, but as Glenn pointed out, when you look over a longer period of time, we've had a fair amount of ups and downs, but we still make underwriting profit sense of 12-month basis. So we don't have a catastrophe problem. So we don't have to restrict stuff and end up with -- what you're poking at is retention issues. We have been there and done that though And it was called the repositioning we did in the latter part of the decade I mentioned. And when you call a customer and say, I used to have -- you used to be insured with us and now I am not going to insure your thoughts and we were one of the biggest brokers have homeowners insurance products. I think in the country and maybe Vegas. And through our advantage in even when you say to people, here's another Company. It has some impact on your auto business. So because people are like, Well, I'll take my business someplace else or competitors decide they want to, they want to bundle and they'll go get those customers as well. We had some issues with auto growth when we were downsizing. We went down by 2 million policies in the homeowner's business over a 4, 5 year-period. It does hurt. It's manageable. I can't speak for what our competitors are going to do. What I do know is what Glenn said, which is we got a good business, we know how to run it. We have growth opportunities, and we're looking forward to serving more customers and make more money for our shareholders along the way. Let me -- maybe -- let me start and then, Glenn, why don't you jump in on what you are doing individually. I think you are right about that. There seems to be this -- a threat going through the markets today. And this is kind of a once and done. And we don't necessarily see it that way. I mean, I think there's never bold enough to decide in claim, we're ahead or of anybody else. Because firstly, I'd assumes everybody is in the same place. Secondly, assumes the same trends are going to happen and third is that those trends are going to end and the answer is we don't know when they will do. What we do know is what we can do differently. And we do know that some of our competitors had frequency increases sooner than we did so that you would expect them to raise prices sooner than we did. We do think that we have a good plan in place and Glenn can take you through that, which is to make sure we get attractive returns in auto insurance, which is a key component of what we do in terms of delivering value for shareholders. We are all over that and we will go -- where -- how that will move forward in terms of competitive position. And that's also hard to tell, what I do know is that I'm really glad we started transformative growth 2 years ago. And the cost reductions we already have in place certainly have benefited us. It's positioned us to be able to grow through many different venues, so we can dial growth up if we choose to do that. I'm really glad we are where we are and we're positioned to take share in the future, which of course, our strategy. But we want to do that profitably. Glenn, do you want to talk about your plans getting the auto insurance returns back to where they have been historically? Mario, do you want to start with the components of the cost reduction and now come back to advertisement? So let me go to advertising then. Let me start with we didn't do transformative growth because of the pandemic, but boy, I am sure glad we got started on transformative growth when we did because we were able to reposition the brand. We invested over $250 million in repositioning the brand, do advertising, testing out new, more sophisticated ways to do it. And we did it when frequency was low, so we were able to use some of that reduction in frequency, the margin it's created, to invest in long-term growth by repositioning the brand. When you look at transfer on breast for a simple right, you get a more competitive price, you have more places to buy it. You let people know about that the increase in advertising, that or restocking that. What we do in the future will be depending how much we want to grow. So as we move forward, I think our advertising will be flat or come down some, because we want to make sure we've got the pricing right. The point that came up earlier about the longevity of the how long will severity keep come up. You want to make sure you've got that pricing right before you go out and get that flywheel going by doing more advertising. That said, we're always going to do a lot of advertising because as you know, it is a marketing war really out there between some of the large players. But the other part that's not as well known is it's getting every bit as sophisticated as auto insurance in home prices. You really got to be good with your math and whether it's upper funnel, lower funnel, getting the right price to the right customer, at the right time, in the right space is complicated. And so the other thing we've been working on is building out the sophistication, so that every dollar of advertising investment we spend is well done. The reason we took it out of the expense ratio guidance was because it is more volatile and it has penned down on what kind of growth we're looking to achieve in that quarter. And this is a measure of really how effectively running the business, like how are you keeping your costs down for your customers see can't hit at competitive price. Elyse, let me give that to Glenn and just -- but Glenn and his team have done a fabulous job in getting us better at direct. Some of the growth that you see is because of the advertisement we talked about, some of the growth you see is we're just getting a lot better at it. And so once we put the Allstate brand on in Glenn study to combine capabilities. We've just -- we're getting much more effective at what we've closed on, and what we've closed in the cost. Glenn when you want to talk about the prospects for address? I don't think you can do a time range on it, because I don't think we can predict what's going to happen in the future on the inflationary pressures. What we can do is say, we're going to go at this aggressively as soon as we can get there. That will be -- we're going to hustle as Glenn to get it. Well, as he said, his priority is auto insurance margins on that part of the business. We got lots of other priorities to look at. But when you look at inflation, I'm not in the camp that the inflationary, like used car prices are suddenly going to go back down. I think you buy a car for $14,000 and use a cost of $10,000, Like, you're not thinking it's worth $10,000 no matter what the Fed and everybody else thinks about it being transitory. I think the same thing is true with when you look at parts prices. Parts prices, it's not like the oil market where prices are -- the system is built to go up and down everyday, it gets embedded in there. The dealers buy inventories, people, distributors buy inventory, they price that. So we don't really see that being transitory and coming down. How long it will take to work all the way through the system, what opportunities the OEs will take to push prices farther up Is really unknown at this part. So it's hard to determine when they will cross, what you do know is at least in it's half-life, just going to keep going up. As long as we see movement in the bottom line. And it will keep going up until the bottom-line plans out, that being the bottom line is being lost cost. And that top-line then will keep going past their point in time until we get back to the margins. But when we get back to the same underwriting margin on a dollar basis, or a percentage basis on auto insurance. You can't really predict until you can have a better handle on where frequency [Indiscernible]. Glenn, anything you would add to that? Glenn do you want to take that? Michael, thank you for asking about something other than auto insurance margins, because we have a lot of good things going on, one of which is Arity, which a significant value has been created with Arity, both in the insurance business and outside the insurance business. And I don't think that's been reviewed by any analysts as if it was a separate Company. I mean, we have 600 billion miles of data. We risk scoring the operation. We help people do marketing, more effectively and efficiently. And so we're really building quite a platform that will do a number of things. One is it does exactly what you've talked about, which is -- and the way we started, it was telematics as a service for us. We needed somebody to collect the data. We needed to get a mobile app up. We needed to put it in files and be able to do something with it. And so rather than do that inside the insurance Company, we decided to do it outside the insurance Company because we said this is -- at the point, we said this is Basically a service at other insurance companies will need and we can provide to them and we do. So. Arity provides that service to some other insurance companies, and we're working to try to expand that effort for them. But it moved beyond what I would just call telematics as a service, help me pull data in to figure out all my customers are doing too. We started collecting more data from ourselves and built a rating service organization so that we can help other insurance companies use telematics to price the insurance. We believe that they're going to get their capability anyway. So we think that we might as well do it through Arity, and capture addition -- additional margin, rather than just assumed that we can take over a 100% of the insurance industry. But being a leader in telematics, which we are, but we don't think we can get the entire market share. So we created a rating services organization around that. It's then been expanded to include really lead generation. As we started collecting more data. So we have data from the Allstate customers, we have data because we have our SDK embedded in other people's thoughts. We have had data and I think it's over 25 million cars were pulling every day, really high fidelity data that's in the same format. We also buy data that we're able to combine with that 25 million on an over another 75 million current. So we're pulling data on a 100 million cars per day right now. And so we're building this rating services organization for all state and other insurers so that we can not only do telematics to the servers. We can do that. We think we can actually work to help people pre -qualify buyers and it's called the Arity IQ. So significant value has been created. I don't think that shows up in shareholder value today because I don't really see any of the analysts really looking hard and saying what's it worth, but we think it's substantial value and we expect to continue to grow their business and expand its total addressable market. Well, it's an accurate call-out, David, that the future expense reductions will certainly help us manage profitability. But we're increasing the price is now because we do want to grow profitably. But being unclear as to where this inflation will sort out, we're being what we think is fair and appropriate, as opposed to overlay aggressive in increasing prices now. As to the extent in the future, we don't need that as much in our expenses come down. Then we can improve our competitive position, which we've been -- we've improved our competitive position pretty significantly in 2021. and we don't want to give that up. And we'd like to continue to improve it as so we get that flywheel of growth going. But in this case, we're using the expense reductions for future competitive price improvement as opposed to saying, we don't need to raise prices because loss costs are [Indiscernible] Glenn or Mario anything you would add to that? At some point, Glenn. Look, we need to make money in auto insurance, David, and we're going to do that. I think we're out of time, so let me just say as we move forward, you should expect us, as you've heard throughout this call, to focus on improving returns in auto insurance. At the same time, we're not letting up on any of the components of increasing our market share and personal property-liability, or expanding circle of protection. All of which we've had really good progress and success on this year and in this quarter, so you should expect us to continue to focus on a broad-based approach to increasing shareholder value. So thank you for your engagement with us again, and we will talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's move to Slide 5 to review property-liability margin results in the third quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses, as well as higher catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates. The chart at the bottom of the slide quantifies the impact of each component in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. As you can see, the personal auto underlying loss ratio drove most of the increase, due to higher auto accident frequency and the inflationary impacts on auto severity. Higher catastrophe losses shown in the middle of the chart, had a negative 1.4 impact on the combined ratio, as favorable reserve re-estimates recorded in 2020 from wildfires subrogation settlements, positively impacted the prior year quarter. Gross catastrophe losses were higher, but were reduced by nearly $1 billion of net reinsurance recoveries following Hurricane Ida, demonstrated the benefits of our long-term approach to risk and return management of the homeowners insurance business and our comprehensive reinsurance program. Non-catastrophe prior-year reserve strengthening of a $162 million in the quarter drove an adverse impact of 0.8 points, primarily from increases in auto and commercial lines. This also included $111 million of strengthening in the quarter related to asbestos, environmental, and other reserves in the runoff property-liability segment, following our annual comprehensive reserve review. This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio when excluding the impact of amortization of purchased intangibles, primarily due to lower restructuring and related charges compared to the prior-year quarter. Moving to Slide 6, let's go a bit deeper on auto insurance profitability. Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio finished at 97.5 for the quarter and 89.7 over the first 9 months of 2021. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects higher loss -- loss costs due to higher accident frequency, increased severity, and competitive pricing enhancements implemented in late 2020 and earlier this year. While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, we continue to experience favorable trends relative to pre -pandemic levels. Allstate brand auto property damage frequency increased 16.6% compared to 2020, but decreased 16.8% relative to 2019. The chart on the lower left compares the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2019 to this quarter, to remove some of the short-term pandemic volatility. The underlying combined ratio was 93.1 in 2019, which generates an attractive return on capital. Favorable auto frequency in the third quarter of 2021, lowered the combined ratio by 6.4 points compared to 2019. Increased auto claim severity, however, increased the combined ratio by 12 points versus 2 years ago, as you can see from the red bar. The cost reductions implemented as part of transformative growth, reduced expenses by 1.3 points, which favorably impacted 2021 results. As Tom mentioned, early in the pandemic, the severity increases were driven by higher average losses due to a reduction in low severity claims. This year, the increase reflects the impact of supply chain disruptions in the auto markets, which has increased used car prices and enabled original equipment manufacturers to significantly increased part prices. The chart on the lower right, shows used car values began increasing above the CPI in late 2020, which accelerated in 2021, resulting in an increase of 44% since the beginning of 2019. Similarly, OEM parts have also increased in 2021, roughly twice as much as core CPI. This has resulted in higher severities for both total loss vehicles and repairable vehicles. Since these increases were accelerating throughout the second and third quarters of the year, we Increased expected loss costs for the first 2 quarters of 2021. And this prior quarter strengthening shows up in the combined ratio for the third quarter. Increases in report year severities for auto insurance claims during the first two quarters of 2021, increased the third quarter combined ratio by 2.6 points, as you can see by the green bar on the lower left. So let's flip to Slide 7, which lays out the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability. As you can see from the chart on the top, Allstate has maintained industry-leading auto insurance margins over a long period of time with a combined ratio operating range in the mid-90s, exhibiting strong execution and operational expertise. To maintain industry-leading results, we are increasing rates, improving claims effectiveness, and continuing to lower costs. After lowering prices in early 2021 to reflect in part Allstate 's lower expense ratio, we have proactively been responding with increases in the third quarter with actions continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2022. The chart on the right provides selected rate increases already implemented in the third and Fourth Quarter, as well as publicly filed rates that have yet to be implemented in the Fourth Quarter. Those states denoted with a carrot, our top ten states in terms of written premium as of year-end 2020 in the third quarter we received rate approvals for increases in 12 states, primarily in September. We adapted quickly to higher severities in the Fourth Quarter with plans to file rates in an additional 20 states. We have already implemented rate increases in 8 states during the Fourth Quarter with an average increase of 6.7% 7% as of November first, looking ahead, we expect to pursue price increases in an additional 12 locations by year-end. We are working closely with state regulators to provide detailed support and decrease the lag time between filing, implementation, and premium generation. As we move into next year, it is likely auto insurance prices will continue to be increased to reflect higher severities. We also continue to leverage advanced claims capabilities and process efficiencies. Cost reductions as part of transformative growth will also continue to be implemented. Let's turn to slide 8 and discuss our expectations and commitment to further improve our cost structure through transformative growth. As you can see by the chart on the bottom of the slide, we've defined a new non-GAAP measure this quarter, referred to as the adjusted expense ratio. This starts with our underwriting expense ratio excluding restructuring, coronavirus related expenses, amortization, and impairment of purchased intangibles, and investments in advertising. It then also adds in our claim expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims, which tend to be more variable. We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-liability business. Through innovation and strong execution, we achieved 2.6 points of improvement when comparing 2020 to 2018 with further improvement occurring through the first 9 months of 2021. Over time, we expect to drive an additional three points of improvement from current levels achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024. This represents about a 6 point reduction relative to 2018 or an average of 1 point per year over 6 years, enabling an improved price position relative to our competitors. While maintaining attractive returns. Future cost reductions center around continued digital enhancements to automate processes enabling the retirement of legacy technology. Operating efficiency gains from combining organization, combining organizations and transforming the distribute -- the distribution model to higher growth and lower cost. Transitioning to slide 9, let's go up a level to show how transformative growth positions us for long-term success and how the components of transformative growth work together to create a flywheel of profitable growth. As you know, transformative growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal property - liability market share, by building a low cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, and deploying a new technology ecosystem. We've made significant progress to date, across each component. Starting at the top of the flywheel visual, our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. Enhancing and expanding distribution puts us in a position to take advantage of more affordable pricing. Increasing the analytical sophistication of new customer acquisitions let's cus -- let's consumers know about this better value proposition. New technology platforms' lower costs, has enable us to further broaden the solutions offered to property-liability customers. This flywheel will enable us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value. Turning to Slide 10, let's look at the changes to the distribution system, which are also underway. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, Property-liability policies in force grew by 12.5% compared to the prior-year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies and Allstate brand property liability policies increased by 231,000, driven by growth across personal lines. Allstate brand auto policies enforce increased slightly compared to the prior-year quarter. And sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, including growth of 142,000 policies compared to prior year-end. As you can see by the table on the lower left. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to the prior year. The middle section of the right chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 5% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. A 38% increase in the direct channel more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would have normally been generated by newly appointed agents. As you know, we significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020, since we are developing a new agent model to drive higher growth at lower-cost. The addition of National General also added 502 thousand new auto applications in the quarter. Let me now turn it over to Mark to cover the remainder of the slides before we move to Q&A. Sure. So Greg, thanks for the question and the acknowledgement of the progress we've made. I guess, why it start is maybe to just kind of go up a level and reiterate again what our objective in reducing costs really is, which is to enhance customer value by improving our competitive price position. And we're going to do that by continuing to drive down the expense component of our combined ratio, which is inclusive of both underwriting and claim expenses and to your point, we've made really good progress over the past several years. And in addition to the progress we've made, we've created plans and have line of sight to the additional 3-point objective that we've got by 2024, by focusing on things like digitizing processes to improve efficiency by continuing -- as we do that, create opportunity to retire legacy technology to capture the synergies associated with the National General acquisition, to continue to drive down distribution costs as we've talked about creating a more productive but lower-cost distribution model. So we've got opportunity in both the -- from an operating cost perspective and both the underwriting and the claim side. And we've got a plan on how to get there, and that's why we established a goal and we think once we can get the additional 3 points out of our cost structure, it's really going to position us well relative to our competitors, to have a more competitive price point, to deliver higher customer value and really position ourselves to accelerate growth."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Allstate's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related materials on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2020 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's start on Slide 2. Today, we're going to link operating results to strategy in order to show how we expect to continue to generate shareholder value. So Allstate\u2019s strategy has two components; increased personal property-liability market share and expand protection solutions, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. The transformative growth plan to increase market share and personal property-liability has four components. This strategy would drive market valuation by executing, innovating, and focusing on long-term value creation. So in the first half of the year, we executed well for customers, we executed well financially and for shareholders as you can see on the right hand panel. Property-liability market share increased by approximately one percentage point through the acquisition of National General. Allstate Protection Plans continued to grow rapidly by broadening the product offering to include appliances and furniture and expanding availability through Home Depot stores. Strong execution generated excellent financial results with revenues increasing 23.8% compared to the prior year, adjusted net income of $3 billion, and a return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months. Shareholders benefited from a 50% increase in the quarterly common dividend and a reduction in outstanding shares by 2.4% just this year, under the current $3 billion share repurchase program. Yesterday, the Board approved a new $5 billion common share repurchase program, which represents approximately 13% of current market capitalization, and we expect to complete that by the end of March of 2023. Let's continue on Slide 3. In addition to operating execution, we're innovating to create long-term value. The transformative growth plan to create a digital insurance company is making good progress. Today, we're going to spend time talking about the distribution component of that plan. Allstate is amongst the leaders in telematics capabilities with Drivewise in the industry's largest pay-per-mile product Milewise, which offers customers unique value. Arity, our telematics service platform company recently launched Arity IQ, which when combined with LeadCloud and Transparent.ly platforms will integrate telematics information into pricing at the time of quote, rather than at the time after the sale. We enhanced our competitive position in independent agent channel by using National General to consolidate and improve our IA business model. We executed agreements to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company New York, to redeploy capital out of lower growth and return businesses and reduce exposure to interest rates. Increasing market share, while maintaining attractive returns and expanding protection solutions through transformation, targeted acquisitions, and divestitures will create shareholder value. Slide 4 lays out the Allstate's strong second quarter performance. Revenues of 12.6 billion in the quarter increased 21.6% compared to the prior year, largely reflects the National General acquisition and higher net investment income. Property-liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 12.9% and 12.1% respectively. Net investment income of $974 million increased by over $0.75 billion compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting $649 million of income from the performance-based portfolio. Net income of 1.6 billion was reported in the second quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $3.79 per diluted share as you can see from the table on the bottom, that's a 40% increase from the prior year quarter. Allstate's excellent execution and strong operating results in the quarter contributed to that return on equity, which I just mentioned of 23.8% over the last 12 months. Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our progress on building transformative growth business models. So, transformative growth is a multiyear initiative and what we're working to do is build a low cost digital insurer with broad distribution, and that's going to be accomplished through four areas; expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, and deploying new technology ecosystems. And in transformative growth - you wouldn't do it all in one day of course, it's got five phases, and substantial progress has been made in phases two and three. Phase two successes include improving the competitive price position of auto insurance, protecting margins by reducing costs, new advertising was launched with increased investment. We also are off to an excellent start with National General. And of course the phases overlap, so progress has also been made in Phase three. So we're transforming the distribution platform, including supporting transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost models, which we'll discuss on the next slide. Improving customer acquisition sophistication will lower costs relative to lifetime value. We continue to focus on lowering underwriting and claims expenses to deliver lower cost protection to customers, and we\u2019ve designed the new technology architecture. We've coded much of the new applications. The next step for us is to launch an integrated system with one product in one state. Turning to Slide 6, let's review how we're transforming the Allstate agent, Allstate direct sales, and independent agent distribution platforms to grow market share. The illustrative on the right side of the slide provides a view into our growth expectations by channel over time. Starting with Allstate exclusive agents, we're making progress transitioning to a higher growth and lower cost model. This year, we changed agent compensation by increasing their business compensation opportunity and reducing a bonus paid on policy renewals. We expect to continue this shift from renewal compensation to new sale because it aligns with what consumers want. Consumers want assistance with purchasing insurance more than they want routine policy service. To lower cost for agents, we're digitizing processes, redesigning products to increase self-service, and expanding centralized service support. We're also working to reduce agent operating expenses and real estate costs. These changes will improve the customer value proposition with lower cost and easier service. Now, of course, you're not going to do this in one day either, so a multiyear transformation - transition program is in place to support existing agents, we've initiated it and it has different levels of support based on agent performance. Given this transition, we reduced new agent appointments last year, which has had a negative impact on new business levels. But as Mario will discuss next, this has been offset by higher productivity from existing agents. At the same time, we have two new agent models in market, which have a personal touch, but a lower cost structure. All of these changes are supported by more competitive auto insurance pricing and increased marketing spending, which is designed to continue to grow. But as you can see on the right, the net impact of these changes for the Allstate agent channel is to be flat to a slight decline in sales in the short-term, but increased growth thereafter. The Allstate direct sales effort leverages the capabilities that we built for the insurance brand, and we've shifted our advertising focus away from insurance to be totally focused on the Allstate brand and utilizing the direct channel for Allstate brand sales as well. The pricing is lower than the Allstate agent model since it doesn't come with the help of an agent. And as this business grows, we're improving our operational and marketing effectiveness. Direct sales now represent 29% of new auto business sales. And we expect that to continue to grow rapidly as you can see on the right. Independent agent distribution also represents an attractive growth opportunity. The acquisition National General enhanced our capabilities in this channel and they added 4 million policies in force. Additional growth is expected by broadening the product portfolio from high risk drivers to middle market auto and home insurance through the existing agent relationships. We also expect to increase the number of agents actively engaged in selling National General products. So when you combine this effective and efficient distribution, with more competitive auto insurance pricing, enhanced marketing, advanced pricing and telematics and the digital experience, that's the transformative growth plan that'll drive property-liability market share growth. So Mario will now discuss the second quarter results in more detail.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks Tom. Turning to Slide 7, let's dive deeper into near-term results on our multifaceted approach to grow property-liability market share. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, property-liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by National General and growth in Allstate brand new business. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies, and Allstate brand property-liability policies increased in the quarter driven by growth in homeowners and other personal lines. Allstate brand auto policies in force declined slightly compared to the prior year quarter, but increased sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, including growth of 111,000 policies compared to prior year and as you can see by the table on the lower left. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to prior year. We continue to make progress in building higher growth business models, as we look to achieve leading positions in all three primary distribution channels. The middle section of the chart on the right shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 6.7% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents excluding new appointments, and a 31% increase in the direct channel more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. The addition of National General also added 481,000 new auto applications in the quarter. Let's turn to Slide 8 to review property-liability margin results in the second quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 95.7 increased 5.9 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased losses relative to the historically low auto accident frequency experienced in the prior year quarter due to the pandemic. Increased losses were partially offset by lower pandemic related expenses, primarily shelter in place paybacks in 2020, as well as lower catastrophe losses. These are represented by the green bars in the combined ratio reconciliation chart on the lower left of the slide. Shifting to the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure. This enables improvement in the competitive price position of auto insurance, and investments in marketing and technology while maintaining strong returns. The total property-liability expense ratio of 24.7 in the second quarter decreased by 7.1 points compared to the prior year, again, driven by lower Coronavirus related expenses. This was partially offset by the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General, restructuring charges, and a 0.7 point increase from higher investment in advertising. Excluding these items as shown by the dark blue bars, the expense ratio decreased by 0.4 points in the second quarter, compared to the prior year period, decreased 1.7 points below year end 2019 and 2.5 points below year end 2018 reflecting continued progress and improving cost efficiencies. Claims expenses have also been reduced through innovations such as QuickFoto Claim, Virtual Assist and aerial imagery, which also improves the customer experience. These claim improvements are not reflected in the expense ratio, but are in the loss ratio and also helped maintain margins. Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss how our auto insurance profitability which remains very strong, and is still favorable to pre-pandemic levels, despite pandemic driven volatility. Allstate protection auto underlying combined ratio finished at 91.8. As you can see from the chart, the level remains favorable to 2017 through 2019 historical second quarter and year end levels despite increasing by 9.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects a comparison to a period with historically low auto accident frequencies. The improvement relative to historical levels is driven by auto accident frequency remaining below pre-pandemic levels, partly offset by auto severity increases and competitive pricing enhancements. To illustrate the pandemic driven volatility, Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency increased 47.3% from the prior year quarter, but is 21% lower than the same period in 2019. Auto severity increases persisted relative to the prior year quarter and pre-pandemic periods across coverages largely driven by the shift in mix to more severe higher speed auto accidents and rising inflationary impacts in both used car values and replacement part costs. The incurred severity increases are running higher than general inflation, which are reflected in the reported combined ratio. To counteract rising severity we are leveraging advanced claim capabilities, predictive modeling, advanced photo and video utilization and deep expertise in repair process management to enable a scaled response to inflation and supply constraints. Targeted price increases will also be implemented as necessary to maintain attractive auto insurance returns. Now let's shift to Slide 10, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. Net investment income totaled $974 million in the quarter, which was $754 million above the prior year quarter driven by higher performance based income as shown in the chart on the left Performance-based income totaled $649 million in the second quarter, as shown in grey, reflecting both idiosyncratic and broad based valuation increases in private equity investments, and to a lesser extent gains from the sale of real estate equity. Market-based income shown in blue was $3 million above the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest bearing portfolio yield was mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. Our total portfolio return in the second quarter totaled 2.6% reflecting income as well as higher fixed income and equity valuations. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit of risk over appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value. We draw upon a deep and experienced team of roughly 350 professionals to leverage expertise and asset allocation, portfolio construction, fundamental research, field leadership, quantitative methods, manager selection and risk management. While the results for this quarter were exceptionally strong, particularly for the performance-based investments, we manage the portfolio with a longer term view on returns. At the right we have provided our annualized portfolio returns over a three, five and 10 year horizon. As disclosed in our investors supplement our performance based portfolio has delivered an attractive 12% IRR over the last 10 years, which compares favorably to relevant public and private market comparisons. Our performance-based strategy takes a longer term view, where we seek to deliver attractive, absolute and risk adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk. Moving to Slide 11, protection services continues to grow revenue and profit. Revenues excluding the impact of realized0 gains and losses increased 27.1% to $581 million in the second quarter. The increase was driven by continued rapid growth in Allstate protection plans, and expanding marketing services at Arity due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparent.ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition. Policies in force increased 15.5% to 147 million, also driven by Allstate protection plans, and supported by the successful launch with the Home Depot in the first quarter. Adjusted net income was $56 million in the second quarter, representing an increase of $18 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by profitable growth at Allstate protection plans and profits at Arity and Allstate identity protection. Allstate protection plans generated adjusted net income of $42 million in the second quarter and $155 million over the past 12 months. Now, let's move to Slide 12, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns in the second quarter, with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months, which was 5.8 points higher than the prior year. Excellent capital management and strong financial results have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of $562 million in share repurchases and $245 million in common stock dividends. We announced the acquisition of SafeAuto in June, leveraging National General's success in integrating companies to accelerate growth. The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed in the third quarter. And yesterday the Board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by March 31, 2023. This represents approximately 13% of our current market capitalization. This new authorization continues Allstate's strong track record of providing cash returns to shareholders and reflects in part, the deployable capital generated by the sale of our life and annuity businesses. Moving to Slide 13, it should be clear that Allstate is an attractive investment opportunity. When you invest in Allstate you get ownership of a company with advanced capabilities and a clear strategy, delivering superior financial results relative to peers and the broader market. The table below shows Allstate across key financial metrics over the past five years compared to the S&P 500 and property casualty insurance peers with a market cap of $4 billion or more. As you can see by the four measures on the top operating EPS, operating return on average equity, cash yield and total shareholder return, Allstate is consistently ranked in the top two or three amongst its peers. In the case of operating EPS and cash yield to common shareholders, Allstate is in the top 10% and top 15% respectively, compared to the S&P 500. Moving down one row, Allstate's top line revenue growth relative to peers and the S&P 500 is in the middle of the pack. We are committed to accelerating top line performance through transformative growth and innovating protection while continuing to deliver excellent financial results. Moving down to the price to earnings ratio, Allstate is well below average, eight out of 10 P&C peers and in the 10th percentile amongst the S&P 500. This is an attractive valuation, given our market leading capabilities, excellent returns, future growth prospects and commitment to accelerate growth. Now, let me turn it back over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Let's turn to Slide 14. Let's finish where we started with a more macro and longer term view of Allstate's execution, innovation and long-term value creation as this is a whole report card as his is what you get by investing in Allstate. Empowering customers with protection is a core part of our purpose. We provide a broad set of protection solutions with over 180 million protection policies in force. You see our name while you're watching TV, you're in Walmart, you're in Target, You're in Casco, you're in Home Depot, Allstate is ubiquitous out there protecting customers. We constantly achieve industry leading margins on auto and home insurance, and have attractive risk adjusted investment returns. As a result, the adjusted net income return on equities averaged 15.6% from 2016 to 2020, ranking number two in our peer group. This has led to a 14.9% annualized total shareholder return over the last five years. We have a history of innovation. Transformative growth is a multiyear personal property-liability strategy to build a digital platform that offers low cost affordable, simple and connected protection solutions. We're simultaneously innovating protection by expanding through telematics, product warranties and identity protection. In telematics we've taken a broad and aggressive approach, the insurance offerings and the creation of Arity leading telematics business. Allstate is also innovating new corporate citizenship, focusing on climate change, privacy and equity. For example, we used an underwriting syndicate for $1.2 billion bond offering last year that was exclusively minority women and veteran owned banking enterprises. Long-term value is also being created through proactive capital management, and strong governance. Over the past five and 10 years we've repurchased 25% and 50% respectively of outstanding shares. Among the S&P 500, Allstate is in the top 15% of cash provided to shareholders. At the same time, we've successfully invested over $6 billion in acquisitions, including Allstate protection plans, Allstate identity protection and National General. And of course, strong governance is key to delivering those results. Allstate has an experienced and first management team and Board with relevant expertise. This is acknowledged by the leading proxy advisory firm that has awarded Allstate the top score for governance. Execution, innovation and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. With that context, let's open the line for your questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James, your question please.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. So I'd like to go back to Slide 5 Tom, and where you lay out the transformative growth strategy, and in the phase two area, you report on substantial progress being made in terms of improved competitive price position in auto insurance. When I went to your supplement, I observed that the average gross premium in the auto brand continued to be lower relative to prior quarters. And I'm just curious how you think about pricing today given the increase in frequency and certainly the increase in severity in the context of your strategy to have an improved competitive price position.\nTom Wilson: Okay, let me start and then I'll get Glenn to jump in. First, in terms of transformative growth, we made a conscious strategic decision to improve the competitive position of auto insurance. When we looked at our cost structure and we looked at where other people were, we decided we needed to be more competitive on pricing. And so, we've been working on that. We've reduced our costs. We've reduced price. We know we're more competitive in the market. And actually you can't really look at the average prices Greg because everybody starts in a different place. So, if you're at 100 and I'm at 95 and you go down 2%, it doesn't make you - really it makes you more competitive [ph], but not competitive, so we look at close rates and we know - we looked at the - when people come to us, they quote what percentage do we close, and when the close rate goes up, you assume you're price competitive and you have a better value proposition. And in fact, that's been true this year, and it's one of the reasons why our new business is up. Now we do that, of course, with great surgical precision. So let me maybe provide an overview of auto insurance profitability because it was the focus of so many of the reports issued last night, and Glenn can jump into what he's got going forward. And I'll start with the analytical structure that I use to evaluate our performance in ways that hopefully will be helpful from an investment perspective. The headline would be to evaluate starting with the current absolute number, don't use one analytical method to assess the future and build on your margin for error. So, the current combined ratio for auto insurance this quarter generated an attractive return on capital. When you look at the number, it's a good return on capital. Looking forward of course is what I need to do and investors need to do, and the forecasting challenge is that the volatility of the components is so high that it's hard to do a quarterly forecast that\u2019s accurate enough to make an important decision. So for example, let's say the percentage is up and down, they're really hard to evaluate, the outcome of 50% decrease, and a 30% increase is a 65%. A 45%, decrease and a 35% increase, it sounds pretty similar, right, but it's the 74%. That small 5 point difference on each side creates a 9 point difference on margins. They're typically less than that. So given the volatility of the percentage changes, we build in margins for error. So as it relates to our projections and forecast so far this year has been pretty good. Severity was higher than expected. But given the volatility of those percentages in the environment, we made sure there was enough margin in pricing and reduced expenses. So as a result, our absolute level of profitability was good and better than many of our competitors' reported results. So the overall goal, of course, is profitable growth. And the best way to manage that total is then you focus on the components, whether that's state-by-state, line by line, or inside the actual cost structure, so Glenn has established goals for the rest of the year on price increases, severity control, and expense reductions. And we have the processes, the math, and state managers that enable us to achieve and adapt, which is we have a consistent track record of doing. So I think when I see people making percentage changes over each quarter and looking at the percentage change of us versus the percentage change of competitors, I'm like when you got the numbers moving around this fast, you really have to go back to the absolute and say, \u201cdid you make money? How did you make money? And how do you make sure you keep making money going forward?\u201d With that let me turn it over Glenn, who can talk a little bit about what he's going to get planned for the rest of the year.\nGlenn Shapiro: Great. Thanks Tom. And Greg, if I go to the first part of your question on price position, the best measure of price competitiveness are close rates, and our closed rates are up. So we've seen a good result on the fact that for a few years, as Mario covered earlier, we've taken expenses out of the system, we've taken those expenses, and essentially allowed customers to get better value from us. And that's improving our close rates, which has helped. The second part, when you talked about going forward with frequency and severity, as Tom said, we have a pretty good forecast on frequency, and it's continued to be lower when you go on a two-year basis. The one-year comparisons right now are interesting on just about everything, but on a two-year basis to pre-pandemic, they continue to be meaningfully lower. Some of that will be just the new different world that we're in with fewer people working in office buildings and travelling in rush hour. Some of that will revert back over time, but we've had really good forecasts on that. The frequency has been higher. Sorry, the severity has been higher with inflationary factors. And so, we're looking at that and where we have to take pricing we will. And I guess, when you put them together the key is in how we've been forecasting, and when we look at when the line will cross. And what I mean by that is, we knew that look, severity compounds over time. So once you're a couple years in which we are now when you're comparing to 2019, you've got a couple of years of severity increases. At some point, it's going to be greater than the benefit that is persisting on frequency and you cross that line. And so, we're pretty good at forecasting about the time we're crossing that line. We moved prices slightly down. In some places, we're still good with those and we still have opportunity to even be more competitive. In other places, we're going to have to take them up. But we don't have wild swings happening in terms of our pricing. We've been pretty careful and cautious to do things that we thought were sustainable, and we're going to continue to do things that we think are sustainable. So as we take expenses out, continuing to do for the remainder of the year, the loss cost management that the claims team is doing and our pricing actions, we think there's more ground we can make up from a competitive position standpoint.\nGreg Peters: That was a very thorough answer. And I was going to ask a question on expenses. But I got to just follow up on your point on severity, and crossing the line. As you know, there's so much oxygen going on around inflationary pressures in the marketplace. And some of its viewed maybe perhaps being transitory, some of it being structural and longer term in nature. And I guess what I'm looking for from you guys is what's your view on the severity trends and can you give us some perspective on that crossing the line analogy that you used Glenn?\nTom Wilson: Well Greg, we don't do forecasts of combined ratio, or the components of the combined ratio. But I think when you look at - it's interesting though, when you look at the supplement, you'll see the paid on property damages is down, that's not related to the way we're booking, they just happen to be paid and there's some timing. So when you look at severity has to be clear difference between what you pay, and what you think you're going to pay eventually. And so we think severity - we know severity is up this year, we booked it up both first quarter and second quarter, even a little more. But so Glenn's got factored into this pricing. Glenn, anything you want to say about the client, maybe talk a little bit about severity control.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yeah. And just to the point about what's transitory and what's in there. I think if you look at both frequency and severity in that way, like they're components of frequency, like we get really detailed into looking at the miles driven, it isn't just what was the total miles driven out there. It's, by state, it's urban versus rural, it's commuting time versus not, it's weekend versus week day and night day. So when we look at all of this, we have a view on what we believe is transitory and what is more sustainable on frequency as well as on severity. But the controls that we have, from a claims standpoint, we have a really strong claims team and they use first of all proprietary models that we have to escalate claims that either need to be expedited, moved faster or need to be prepared for defense in terms of injury claims. Tell us the likelihood of litigation, the likelihood of representation, things like that, we leverage our scale really well and that we have long-term pricing deals on a lot of the parts and labor that are out there for whether it's auto or home, so some of that acts as a hedge towards inflation. And it's not perfect, because we're in the same inflationary environment that others are in. But we do with our buying power have had good long-term deals that we've negotiated that help to hedge that to some degree and then really strong quality process that we manage across the system. So we feel good about our ability to manage within the environment, but also we have to price for it as it moves. And I guess I'll close by saying, if anything, our history is been proven, I would say, we do a really good job managing to our returns. And Mario and Tom talked about those in the opening quite a bit. We will manage to produce the right returns and when we need to take price to do that we do it.\nGreg Peters: Makes sense. Thank you for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler, your question, please.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. A little bit more of a key off of those last questions. But one of the questions I'm getting a lot is whether or not there'll be sort of regulatory issues with auto in particular if we need to get more rate and I'd love to hear your thoughts on how that gets managed at Allstate.\nTom Wilson: I'll maybe start with a little macro and then Glenn can talk about anything we're doing specifically. Paul, I think the first place I would start is the regulatory reaction tends to start with what consumers think. And consumers are in a pretty good place. Our customers are in pretty good place getting a billion dollars back last year. There's plenty - if you look at savings rates and cash and bank accounts and all kinds of stuff, consumers are not - have some pricing ability - there not a lot of pricing pressure coming from consumers each day, so again the count of percentage increases that we need or not so large, you're not talking about double digit price increases that cause everybody to call the insurance regulator and say I don't like this world. So we don't see a lot of consumer pushback. When you look at the regulators we have a good relationship with our regulators. I mean, we were 10 days in last year, I mean, Glenn, I think it was like 10 days into March, we were like we got to do something about this. So we went out proactively to regulators and said, we don't have a requirement to do this, we have no contractual requirement to do it. But we know you'll want us to do it. So we're going to do it in advance upfront and we led the industry in doing that. So we feel like we have good relationships with them, we've been balanced as to how we approach it. And we've been able to earn the economic rents in the marketplace and compete successfully. And Glenn anything, you want to talk about in terms of specifics.\nGlenn Shapiro: First, I think is a really good point with some of the credibility we earned last year, because it's not only the shift the return of the money, but the fact that we went out there and proactively had the idea to say, we're just going to waive the requirement that you have an endorsement to do deliveries, let's say with your car and turn your car into an economic vehicle for you, for people that were out of work. They appreciate the fact that we were thinking about the way people were having to live their lives and not having to go buy an endorsement to do it. And we just gave it away for free and filed that across 50 states and in a matter of days, and special payment plans, allowing people more time to pay. So I think we did build a lot of credibility with that. But I think the core of this is the regulators have actuaries. And we have actuaries, and they are math based. So this is - sometimes you get into some emotion with it, but it's really a fact based and math based situation. So when severities go up or loss ratios move their actuaries with our actuaries and we have great relationships working to that one.\nTom Wilson: Yeah, when rental cars go from 50 bucks a day to $100 a day or used car prices go up 40%, regulators know you got to make - you got to collect more money to take care of that.\nPaul Newsome: Makes sense and I'd like to ask homeowners question. I tend to think that people underestimate the durability and impact of the home business. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there from a pricing and competitive perspective? And whether or not the outlook is more favorable overtime? But it does seem to be - if anything, it seems like you're selling more of it and seems like it's a lead product for you at the moment?\nTom Wilson: Well, Paul, thank you for recognizing how successful we've been at home. Like there are days, when I feel like people think the only thing we sell is auto insurance. And like we make a lot of money in homeowners insurance, we're really good at it. It does require lower margins than auto insurance, because you got to put up a lot more capital because of the volatility. And you don't get a lot of investment income. So we've been very good at it. Glenn, do you want to talk about how we're doing this?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yeah, boy, do I. Yeah, I appreciate that Paul. We feel really good about where we are in homeowners. So I'll give you a quick number on the last five years, 89 combined ratio, that's recorded combined ratio not underlying, and we've made just over $4 billion in the past five years of underwriting profit. So we're good at this, I don't mind being bold enough to say that we - I think we have a sustained and systemic advantage in homeowners that we've proven over a long period of time. And it goes to the claims capabilities, the cap management capabilities, our reinsurance system that we have, our risk selection, our product capability and pricing. So it's a pretty deep skill that's been honed over a long period of time that we're able to leverage. And so when you look at there's no question that inflation is hitting the homeowner side hard and you got weather events. And you look at what it's doing to the industry more broadly than us. And there's going to be folks taking a lot of rate out there. And I think you've heard that from them. And our product is such that like, year-over-year, we're at 6% up on average premium, even though we took only three and a half points a rate because built into it, there's some inflationary factor. So we're really well positioned to continue to make money at it, protect a lot of people. And last point is it goes to what Tom talked about earlier about transformative growth. You look at the independent agent system. We bought National General primarily to really have a ticket into that system, where they have great systems, a lot of appointments, great relationships and they're good at some products. Well, we're really good at home. You get that home product into the IA channel. And I think it's going to sell well, we're going protect a lot of people we're going to help IAs grow.\nPaul Newsome: Thank you, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from wine of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI, your question, please.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. I had a question just on frequency. And I guess it's a question maybe you can clarify how that trended throughout the quarter by month? And maybe just talk about what you're seeing today. And should we be thinking about frequency being more flat with 2019, combined with 14% to 15% severity increase versus '19 that you guys called out in the 10-Q?\nTom Wilson: David, I'll get Glenn to answer the question on frequency. I'm not sure where that 14% to 15% came from, but and how you've factored. What period of time you're focused, is that two years and then one year? Because you can't take a two year trend and extrapolate it onto annual trends is, maybe that's what I heard. But Glenn do you want to talk just about frequency?\nGlenn Shapiro: Sure. Yeah. No, I would not - the short answer would be I would not say you should just expect a zero frequency trend relative to 2019. Well, we don't publish any forecasting on frequency. I think, broadly people in the industry have talked about the fact that safer cars have tended to have a little bit of a tailwind for frequency, even take away the pandemic for a moment that year-over-year we've had a long-term steady decline in frequency. And so you've got a couple of years of data as you compare to 2019. On top of that, we see and I alluded to this a little bit before, we see a really material change in the way people are driving. So even when you see the aggregate number of miles driven coming back still lower, but closer to 2019 levels. Who is driving, when they're driving and how they're driving is changing materially? So you see about a four or five point difference between the net change of urban driving being down more than rural driving. So you look at an Allstate book of business where we sell predominantly through exclusive agents or solicit agents or in more populated markets that tends to favor the way the frequency comes through. You look at the type of driving that's done, I mentioned before commuting is down significantly more than non-commuting. So quick stat for us, we look at a lot of these details. Weekend driving is actually higher right now than 2019 was. People just want to get out. Weekday driving is materially lower and particularly in rush hour. So when you see less congested roads in the time period, when the predominance of accidents happen in those morning and afternoon commutes that is helpful to particularly in our book of business, the way frequency comes through. So there are elements that will come back, it will come back differently and it is the only thing I'm confident in saying is that the world will look exactly the same after the pandemic than before. And that will mean that people drive and move differently. We see some non-transitory or temporary impacts to frequency.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it, okay, thanks and Tom, yes, yeah, I was referring to just Page 63 of the 10-Q, which is, yeah, that 14% to 15% is over two years. So you're right. It's about 7% on average per year. I guess, just a follow up just on the rate actions that you're thinking about taking? I just saw, I think it was like a 5% rate increase that you filed in Georgia recently. Maybe could you just talk about how widespread the rate increases are that you want to put in and maybe just talk a bit more about how you think that might impact the growth trajectory going forward?\nTom Wilson: Well, we don't - we've got - we got plans for the rest of the year is where we think we need to increase price. But we don't give those out for competitive reasons. And we also need to bring traders to agree. So I would just say that we think we will. You should rely on the fact David that we know how to make money and we're focused on making money. As to the competitive business I think it depends what other people do. So you heard yesterday if you listen to the Progressive call they're all in on raising prices, cutting advertising, changing underwriting stuff. So we think that gives us room to adapt and continue to grow, and make money and make sure that we can recover costs as they go up. Other competitors are in different places. But we feel good about where we're at, like trades for growth. Like if you start off and said, would you want to - have a pandemic and a huge drop in frequency for a year to do transformative growth? You probably would say, I don't know, like it's a lot of volatility to manage. On the other hand, I think in our particular case, it's worked well for us.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thank you. Is it your sense that the rest of the industry is going to start raising prices?\nTom Wilson: If you look at what they've done then we can really focus on and there have been more rate increases this year than I think probably people would have predicted if you asked them in the fourth quarter of last year. And that would include us, like if you just said, what do we think everybody was going to do this year? We wouldn't have thought they had to go up as much as they did. But we also didn't think severity was going to be as high as it is. So we're increasing ours, and they're increasing theirs. But we think our relative advantage, given our sophistication in pricing, given our reduction in expenses, given what we're doing on the long-term basis to get expenses down even farther, puts us in good place. So we don't see anything happening that tells us we can't still be on the path to grow market share. The specific roads we go down might be a little different. But we're still feeling like that goal is still there or the objective is still achievable.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Meyer Shields from KBW, your question, please.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I wanted to dig in a little bit to Allstate direct, I just want understand the thought on the pricing strategy. And what I mean by that is I think we've got demographic trends favoring direct distribution, but also to massive competitors and I wanted to know whether the competitive posture is that you have to be in line with where Progressive and GEICO are? Or can you benefit enough from these demographic trends to achieve your growth goals.\nTom Wilson: I'm trying to sort through Meyer - the first direct should be priced for what you get like you should get what you pay for. So when you buy Allstate direct, it's I think on average, about 7% lower than if you buy from an agent because it doesn't come with health, and so it's you get what you pay for. And there are people - there are some demographic shifts there. But some of it's not - there are some young people who want help and some older people who don't want help. And so where their focus is not as much on demographics of those channels, but it is the customer value. As it relates to our competitive position in each channel, we believe you should have a competitive price position in each channel, like-for-like, so if you're buying from GEICO or Progressive and you're buying direct and you're buying from Allstate, you're buying direct, you should - it should be the same kind of value. Now, it gets a little dicier when you figure out prices because what the limits are and all kinds of - it's complicated fast. But the conceptual approach would be, be competitive in channel based on the value you deliver to shareholders, or the customers. Glenn how would you - is there other things you'd add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yeah. Going to the point about what do we get out just the demographic shift versus being more competitive? Clearly, it's a growing channel. So if you are - if you're sitting in the boat and the current is taking you in a certain direction, so that there's something to, you really should be there, and that's why we're there. It's why transformative growth, why we wanted to be in all channels and where customers want to buy. So I think there's some benefit to that. But the bigger benefit is two other things. One would be being competitively priced, why we're going after expenses, why we did the pricing differential that Tom talked about. And then the third one, which frankly, maybe even the most important is just your execution in it and it's the fact that it we have used the capabilities of insurance, but we're still newer at being a large national player with the brand we've got of Allstate doing this is building the capabilities whether it's web, our sales processes, marketing sophistication, integration of marketing into it. So that we are winning our fair share there because you got to get the price to be competitive, but you also have to be great at the process itself.\nTom Wilson: So as we go back to that slide where we showed the three different channels, direct is up, as we said it's not 29% of sales, we expected to continue to go up as Glenn said, as we get better. There are some shifts to that channel if you just look globally, some of that's because more people feel comfortable buying over the web and not going through some of that. Some of it is just because direct is a whole bunch of advertising and it drives people to it. But we're, as Glenn pointed out in that boat and increasing our capabilities. But that doesn't mean we're waving the flag on people-to-people exchange. And so the key part of transformer growth is, there are people who want help. We just need to give it them at a lower cost. And that's what we're working on. So people were more than happy to pay a lot of money - not lot, but to be paid for help to buy the insurance, they just don't want to pay you 10% for ongoing service when they can do self-service, it is not much to be done or you can do at a lower cost centrally. So that's our shift and transformer. We're not waving the flag on person-to-person sales. In fact, we're leaning in and saying we have a great position here, we have a great brand, people know us, we just need to do it more effectively and create higher growth models. So that will take us some time to transition. As we talked about, like I don't expect the Allstate agent business to jump up the way you'll see the direct business increase over the next 12 months. But I do think it's got great long-term potential. And we're investing heavily in making sure those agents can deliver what people want if they want help buying products.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that was quite helpful. Thank you. A quick follow up if I can, has the - I guess recent severity issues in both auto and home, have those changed the timeline for rolling out the standard products on National General's platform?\nTom Wilson: Short answer would be no, we think we can be really competitive in that market. And we're excited to get into the independent agent channel and do it as quickly as we can. We'll have some of our middle market products this year on the NatGen platform branded as National General and Allstate Company. So we'll get the benefit of the endorsed brand. And then over the next two years, we'll be rolling that out as quickly as we can.\nMeyer Shields: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley, your question please.\nMichael Phillips: Hey, thanks. Good morning. In your introductory comments on severity, you talked about some other ways to counter it besides the target price increases, could you expand upon maybe how those will help severity issues, I didn't really get all the lists you were talking about maybe go through those little more detail and talk about how they can help you counter severity besides price?\nTom Wilson: Sure. Thanks, Michael. It really is about claims capabilities and paying what you owe, in being fair to folks. But making sure you don't pay more than you owe as things move. So we have inflationary factors, for example, say on materials for homeowners, having purchasing power, and having really good deals in place over the long-term on flooring, on roofing, and other products used in home repair, helps hedge that inflation. And with our size, with our buying power and with the capabilities of our claims team, we've been able to do that helps hedge it. Again, I'm not suggesting it eliminates the problem of inflation. But it does help mitigate it so that not all of that cost is passed through to your customers. Because in our view the job to our customers, obviously we got to put them back to where they were. We've got to charge people an appropriate price and give them the best value possible. And part of that is mitigating the cost of claims. So that was in the purchasing power. The proprietary models I mentioned before, is we've just invested a lot in our analytics and data capabilities over the years in order to flag claims that were at risk for accelerating costs so that we could get it into the right experts hands at the right time and it allows us to do a better quality job on those and also manage the costs.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thank you for that. One other quick one if I could then, you had a lot of talk on the direct to consumer channel for auto and clearly that's a growth area. What's your view on that channel longer term for the homeowners market?\nTom Wilson: We think it's good. I mean, I think people do want sometimes a little more help on their home because they care more about their home. But we think that those people who are comfortable using advanced technology, bots, chat on assets you can get online should be able to buy more homes direct.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, cool. Thank you.\nTom Wilson: Thank you for taking the time. Maybe just close on a few things first on investment results. I totally understand the view that one would not fully count the huge increase in performance spacing. But when I read some of the reports, I'm like I think it's fair to say it was an outsize quarter. But that doesn't mean that our long-term results should be ignored. We're good in investments we had good results. Our acquisitions are performing well, whether that be Allstate protection plans, which we didn't really get questions on today. I just want to remind you we bought that company four years ago at $1.4 billion. It's now over a billion dollars in revenue. It's growing at 27% a year. It made $155 million, which means we paid nine times earnings for business that is growing 27%. So we think it's worth a lot more than that. National General, we also think will be highly successful. But we're off to a really good start there. You can see that in the current numbers. And it's not just the 4 million policies we added. By the way, when you look at the net cash, we had the layout after a stretch to our capital. I do not believe we could have acquired 1% market share by putting a couple of billion dollars into advertising. So we think it was also just an economic growth opportunity straight up, forget the strategic potential for the growth. And then share repurchases we continue to really do well. This is the biggest share repurchase program we've ever announced both in dollars and percentage of market capitalization that's build up. So, thank you for participating today. We had great results this quarter. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Glenn Shapiro",
            "content": "Great. Thanks Tom. And Greg, if I go to the first part of your question on price position, the best measure of price competitiveness are close rates, and our closed rates are up. So we've seen a good result on the fact that for a few years, as Mario covered earlier, we've taken expenses out of the system, we've taken those expenses, and essentially allowed customers to get better value from us. And that's improving our close rates, which has helped. The second part, when you talked about going forward with frequency and severity, as Tom said, we have a pretty good forecast on frequency, and it's continued to be lower when you go on a two-year basis. The one-year comparisons right now are interesting on just about everything, but on a two-year basis to pre-pandemic, they continue to be meaningfully lower. Some of that will be just the new different world that we're in with fewer people working in office buildings and travelling in rush hour. Some of that will revert back over time, but we've had really good forecasts on that. The frequency has been higher. Sorry, the severity has been higher with inflationary factors. And so, we're looking at that and where we have to take pricing we will. And I guess, when you put them together the key is in how we've been forecasting, and when we look at when the line will cross. And what I mean by that is, we knew that look, severity compounds over time. So once you're a couple years in which we are now when you're comparing to 2019, you've got a couple of years of severity increases. At some point, it's going to be greater than the benefit that is persisting on frequency and you cross that line. And so, we're pretty good at forecasting about the time we're crossing that line. We moved prices slightly down. In some places, we're still good with those and we still have opportunity to even be more competitive. In other places, we're going to have to take them up. But we don't have wild swings happening in terms of our pricing. We've been pretty careful and cautious to do things that we thought were sustainable, and we're going to continue to do things that we think are sustainable. So as we take expenses out, continuing to do for the remainder of the year, the loss cost management that the claims team is doing and our pricing actions, we think there's more ground we can make up from a competitive position standpoint. Yeah. And just to the point about what's transitory and what's in there. I think if you look at both frequency and severity in that way, like they're components of frequency, like we get really detailed into looking at the miles driven, it isn't just what was the total miles driven out there. It's, by state, it's urban versus rural, it's commuting time versus not, it's weekend versus week day and night day. So when we look at all of this, we have a view on what we believe is transitory and what is more sustainable on frequency as well as on severity. But the controls that we have, from a claims standpoint, we have a really strong claims team and they use first of all proprietary models that we have to escalate claims that either need to be expedited, moved faster or need to be prepared for defense in terms of injury claims. Tell us the likelihood of litigation, the likelihood of representation, things like that, we leverage our scale really well and that we have long-term pricing deals on a lot of the parts and labor that are out there for whether it's auto or home, so some of that acts as a hedge towards inflation. And it's not perfect, because we're in the same inflationary environment that others are in. But we do with our buying power have had good long-term deals that we've negotiated that help to hedge that to some degree and then really strong quality process that we manage across the system. So we feel good about our ability to manage within the environment, but also we have to price for it as it moves. And I guess I'll close by saying, if anything, our history is been proven, I would say, we do a really good job managing to our returns. And Mario and Tom talked about those in the opening quite a bit. We will manage to produce the right returns and when we need to take price to do that we do it. First, I think is a really good point with some of the credibility we earned last year, because it's not only the shift the return of the money, but the fact that we went out there and proactively had the idea to say, we're just going to waive the requirement that you have an endorsement to do deliveries, let's say with your car and turn your car into an economic vehicle for you, for people that were out of work. They appreciate the fact that we were thinking about the way people were having to live their lives and not having to go buy an endorsement to do it. And we just gave it away for free and filed that across 50 states and in a matter of days, and special payment plans, allowing people more time to pay. So I think we did build a lot of credibility with that. But I think the core of this is the regulators have actuaries. And we have actuaries, and they are math based. So this is - sometimes you get into some emotion with it, but it's really a fact based and math based situation. So when severities go up or loss ratios move their actuaries with our actuaries and we have great relationships working to that one. Yeah, boy, do I. Yeah, I appreciate that Paul. We feel really good about where we are in homeowners. So I'll give you a quick number on the last five years, 89 combined ratio, that's recorded combined ratio not underlying, and we've made just over $4 billion in the past five years of underwriting profit. So we're good at this, I don't mind being bold enough to say that we - I think we have a sustained and systemic advantage in homeowners that we've proven over a long period of time. And it goes to the claims capabilities, the cap management capabilities, our reinsurance system that we have, our risk selection, our product capability and pricing. So it's a pretty deep skill that's been honed over a long period of time that we're able to leverage. And so when you look at there's no question that inflation is hitting the homeowner side hard and you got weather events. And you look at what it's doing to the industry more broadly than us. And there's going to be folks taking a lot of rate out there. And I think you've heard that from them. And our product is such that like, year-over-year, we're at 6% up on average premium, even though we took only three and a half points a rate because built into it, there's some inflationary factor. So we're really well positioned to continue to make money at it, protect a lot of people. And last point is it goes to what Tom talked about earlier about transformative growth. You look at the independent agent system. We bought National General primarily to really have a ticket into that system, where they have great systems, a lot of appointments, great relationships and they're good at some products. Well, we're really good at home. You get that home product into the IA channel. And I think it's going to sell well, we're going protect a lot of people we're going to help IAs grow. Sure. Yeah. No, I would not - the short answer would be I would not say you should just expect a zero frequency trend relative to 2019. Well, we don't publish any forecasting on frequency. I think, broadly people in the industry have talked about the fact that safer cars have tended to have a little bit of a tailwind for frequency, even take away the pandemic for a moment that year-over-year we've had a long-term steady decline in frequency. And so you've got a couple of years of data as you compare to 2019. On top of that, we see and I alluded to this a little bit before, we see a really material change in the way people are driving. So even when you see the aggregate number of miles driven coming back still lower, but closer to 2019 levels. Who is driving, when they're driving and how they're driving is changing materially? So you see about a four or five point difference between the net change of urban driving being down more than rural driving. So you look at an Allstate book of business where we sell predominantly through exclusive agents or solicit agents or in more populated markets that tends to favor the way the frequency comes through. You look at the type of driving that's done, I mentioned before commuting is down significantly more than non-commuting. So quick stat for us, we look at a lot of these details. Weekend driving is actually higher right now than 2019 was. People just want to get out. Weekday driving is materially lower and particularly in rush hour. So when you see less congested roads in the time period, when the predominance of accidents happen in those morning and afternoon commutes that is helpful to particularly in our book of business, the way frequency comes through. So there are elements that will come back, it will come back differently and it is the only thing I'm confident in saying is that the world will look exactly the same after the pandemic than before. And that will mean that people drive and move differently. We see some non-transitory or temporary impacts to frequency. Yeah. Going to the point about what do we get out just the demographic shift versus being more competitive? Clearly, it's a growing channel. So if you are - if you're sitting in the boat and the current is taking you in a certain direction, so that there's something to, you really should be there, and that's why we're there. It's why transformative growth, why we wanted to be in all channels and where customers want to buy. So I think there's some benefit to that. But the bigger benefit is two other things. One would be being competitively priced, why we're going after expenses, why we did the pricing differential that Tom talked about. And then the third one, which frankly, maybe even the most important is just your execution in it and it's the fact that it we have used the capabilities of insurance, but we're still newer at being a large national player with the brand we've got of Allstate doing this is building the capabilities whether it's web, our sales processes, marketing sophistication, integration of marketing into it. So that we are winning our fair share there because you got to get the price to be competitive, but you also have to be great at the process itself."

            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's start on Slide 2. Today, we're going to link operating results to strategy in order to show how we expect to continue to generate shareholder value. So Allstate's strategy has two components; increased personal property-liability market share and expand protection solutions, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. The transformative growth plan to increase market share and personal property-liability has four components. This strategy would drive market valuation by executing, innovating, and focusing on long-term value creation. So in the first half of the year, we executed well for customers, we executed well financially and for shareholders as you can see on the right hand panel. Property-liability market share increased by approximately one percentage point through the acquisition of National General. Allstate Protection Plans continued to grow rapidly by broadening the product offering to include appliances and furniture and expanding availability through Home Depot stores. Strong execution generated excellent financial results with revenues increasing 23.8% compared to the prior year, adjusted net income of $3 billion, and a return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months. Shareholders benefited from a 50% increase in the quarterly common dividend and a reduction in outstanding shares by 2.4% just this year, under the current $3 billion share repurchase program. Yesterday, the Board approved a new $5 billion common share repurchase program, which represents approximately 13% of current market capitalization, and we expect to complete that by the end of March of 2023. Let's continue on Slide 3. In addition to operating execution, we're innovating to create long-term value. The transformative growth plan to create a digital insurance company is making good progress. Today, we're going to spend time talking about the distribution component of that plan. Allstate is amongst the leaders in telematics capabilities with Drivewise in the industry's largest pay-per-mile product Milewise, which offers customers unique value. Arity, our telematics service platform company recently launched Arity IQ, which when combined with LeadCloud and Transparent.ly platforms will integrate telematics information into pricing at the time of quote, rather than at the time after the sale. We enhanced our competitive position in independent agent channel by using National General to consolidate and improve our IA business model. We executed agreements to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company New York, to redeploy capital out of lower growth and return businesses and reduce exposure to interest rates. Increasing market share, while maintaining attractive returns and expanding protection solutions through transformation, targeted acquisitions, and divestitures will create shareholder value. Slide 4 lays out the Allstate's strong second quarter performance. Revenues of 12.6 billion in the quarter increased 21.6% compared to the prior year, largely reflects the National General acquisition and higher net investment income. Property-liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 12.9% and 12.1% respectively. Net investment income of $974 million increased by over $0.75 billion compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting $649 million of income from the performance-based portfolio. Net income of 1.6 billion was reported in the second quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $3.79 per diluted share as you can see from the table on the bottom, that's a 40% increase from the prior year quarter. Allstate's excellent execution and strong operating results in the quarter contributed to that return on equity, which I just mentioned of 23.8% over the last 12 months. Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our progress on building transformative growth business models. So, transformative growth is a multiyear initiative and what we're working to do is build a low cost digital insurer with broad distribution, and that's going to be accomplished through four areas; expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, and deploying new technology ecosystems. And in transformative growth - you wouldn't do it all in one day of course, it's got five phases, and substantial progress has been made in phases two and three. Phase two successes include improving the competitive price position of auto insurance, protecting margins by reducing costs, new advertising was launched with increased investment. We also are off to an excellent start with National General. And of course the phases overlap, so progress has also been made in Phase three. So we're transforming the distribution platform, including supporting transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost models, which we'll discuss on the next slide. Improving customer acquisition sophistication will lower costs relative to lifetime value. We continue to focus on lowering underwriting and claims expenses to deliver lower cost protection to customers, and we've designed the new technology architecture. We've coded much of the new applications. The next step for us is to launch an integrated system with one product in one state. Turning to Slide 6, let's review how we're transforming the Allstate agent, Allstate direct sales, and independent agent distribution platforms to grow market share. The illustrative on the right side of the slide provides a view into our growth expectations by channel over time. Starting with Allstate exclusive agents, we're making progress transitioning to a higher growth and lower cost model. This year, we changed agent compensation by increasing their business compensation opportunity and reducing a bonus paid on policy renewals. We expect to continue this shift from renewal compensation to new sale because it aligns with what consumers want. Consumers want assistance with purchasing insurance more than they want routine policy service. To lower cost for agents, we're digitizing processes, redesigning products to increase self-service, and expanding centralized service support. We're also working to reduce agent operating expenses and real estate costs. These changes will improve the customer value proposition with lower cost and easier service. Now, of course, you're not going to do this in one day either, so a multiyear transformation - transition program is in place to support existing agents, we've initiated it and it has different levels of support based on agent performance. Given this transition, we reduced new agent appointments last year, which has had a negative impact on new business levels. But as Mario will discuss next, this has been offset by higher productivity from existing agents. At the same time, we have two new agent models in market, which have a personal touch, but a lower cost structure. All of these changes are supported by more competitive auto insurance pricing and increased marketing spending, which is designed to continue to grow. But as you can see on the right, the net impact of these changes for the Allstate agent channel is to be flat to a slight decline in sales in the short-term, but increased growth thereafter. The Allstate direct sales effort leverages the capabilities that we built for the insurance brand, and we've shifted our advertising focus away from insurance to be totally focused on the Allstate brand and utilizing the direct channel for Allstate brand sales as well. The pricing is lower than the Allstate agent model since it doesn't come with the help of an agent. And as this business grows, we're improving our operational and marketing effectiveness. Direct sales now represent 29% of new auto business sales. And we expect that to continue to grow rapidly as you can see on the right. Independent agent distribution also represents an attractive growth opportunity. The acquisition National General enhanced our capabilities in this channel and they added 4 million policies in force. Additional growth is expected by broadening the product portfolio from high risk drivers to middle market auto and home insurance through the existing agent relationships. We also expect to increase the number of agents actively engaged in selling National General products. So when you combine this effective and efficient distribution, with more competitive auto insurance pricing, enhanced marketing, advanced pricing and telematics and the digital experience, that's the transformative growth plan that'll drive property-liability market share growth. So Mario will now discuss the second quarter results in more detail. Let's turn to Slide 14. Let's finish where we started with a more macro and longer term view of Allstate's execution, innovation and long-term value creation as this is a whole report card as his is what you get by investing in Allstate. Empowering customers with protection is a core part of our purpose. We provide a broad set of protection solutions with over 180 million protection policies in force. You see our name while you're watching TV, you're in Walmart, you're in Target, You're in Casco, you're in Home Depot, Allstate is ubiquitous out there protecting customers. We constantly achieve industry leading margins on auto and home insurance, and have attractive risk adjusted investment returns. As a result, the adjusted net income return on equities averaged 15.6% from 2016 to 2020, ranking number two in our peer group. This has led to a 14.9% annualized total shareholder return over the last five years. We have a history of innovation. Transformative growth is a multiyear personal property-liability strategy to build a digital platform that offers low cost affordable, simple and connected protection solutions. We're simultaneously innovating protection by expanding through telematics, product warranties and identity protection. In telematics we've taken a broad and aggressive approach, the insurance offerings and the creation of Arity leading telematics business. Allstate is also innovating new corporate citizenship, focusing on climate change, privacy and equity. For example, we used an underwriting syndicate for $1.2 billion bond offering last year that was exclusively minority women and veteran owned banking enterprises. Long-term value is also being created through proactive capital management, and strong governance. Over the past five and 10 years we've repurchased 25% and 50% respectively of outstanding shares. Among the S&P 500, Allstate is in the top 15% of cash provided to shareholders. At the same time, we've successfully invested over $6 billion in acquisitions, including Allstate protection plans, Allstate identity protection and National General. And of course, strong governance is key to delivering those results. Allstate has an experienced and first management team and Board with relevant expertise. This is acknowledged by the leading proxy advisory firm that has awarded Allstate the top score for governance. Execution, innovation and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. With that context, let's open the line for your questions. Okay, let me start and then I'll get Glenn to jump in. First, in terms of transformative growth, we made a conscious strategic decision to improve the competitive position of auto insurance. When we looked at our cost structure and we looked at where other people were, we decided we needed to be more competitive on pricing. And so, we've been working on that. We've reduced our costs. We've reduced price. We know we're more competitive in the market. And actually you can't really look at the average prices Greg because everybody starts in a different place. So, if you're at 100 and I'm at 95 and you go down 2%, it doesn't make you - really it makes you more competitive [ph], but not competitive, so we look at close rates and we know - we looked at the - when people come to us, they quote what percentage do we close, and when the close rate goes up, you assume you're price competitive and you have a better value proposition. And in fact, that's been true this year, and it's one of the reasons why our new business is up. Now we do that, of course, with great surgical precision. So let me maybe provide an overview of auto insurance profitability because it was the focus of so many of the reports issued last night, and Glenn can jump into what he's got going forward. And I'll start with the analytical structure that I use to evaluate our performance in ways that hopefully will be helpful from an investment perspective. The headline would be to evaluate starting with the current absolute number, don't use one analytical method to assess the future and build on your margin for error. So, the current combined ratio for auto insurance this quarter generated an attractive return on capital. When you look at the number, it's a good return on capital. Looking forward of course is what I need to do and investors need to do, and the forecasting challenge is that the volatility of the components is so high that it's hard to do a quarterly forecast that's accurate enough to make an important decision. So for example, let's say the percentage is up and down, they're really hard to evaluate, the outcome of 50% decrease, and a 30% increase is a 65%. A 45%, decrease and a 35% increase, it sounds pretty similar, right, but it's the 74%. That small 5 point difference on each side creates a 9 point difference on margins. They're typically less than that. So given the volatility of the percentage changes, we build in margins for error. So as it relates to our projections and forecast so far this year has been pretty good. Severity was higher than expected. But given the volatility of those percentages in the environment, we made sure there was enough margin in pricing and reduced expenses. So as a result, our absolute level of profitability was good and better than many of our competitors' reported results. So the overall goal, of course, is profitable growth. And the best way to manage that total is then you focus on the components, whether that's state-by-state, line by line, or inside the actual cost structure, so Glenn has established goals for the rest of the year on price increases, severity control, and expense reductions. And we have the processes, the math, and state managers that enable us to achieve and adapt, which is we have a consistent track record of doing. So I think when I see people making percentage changes over each quarter and looking at the percentage change of us versus the percentage change of competitors, I'm like when you got the numbers moving around this fast, you really have to go back to the absolute and say, \u201cdid you make money? How did you make money? And how do you make sure you keep making money going forward?\u201d With that let me turn it over Glenn, who can talk a little bit about what he's going to get planned for the rest of the year. Well Greg, we don't do forecasts of combined ratio, or the components of the combined ratio. But I think when you look at - it's interesting though, when you look at the supplement, you'll see the paid on property damages is down, that's not related to the way we're booking, they just happen to be paid and there's some timing. So when you look at severity has to be clear difference between what you pay, and what you think you're going to pay eventually. And so we think severity - we know severity is up this year, we booked it up both first quarter and second quarter, even a little more. But so Glenn's got factored into this pricing. Glenn, anything you want to say about the client, maybe talk a little bit about severity control. I'll maybe start with a little macro and then Glenn can talk about anything we're doing specifically. Paul, I think the first place I would start is the regulatory reaction tends to start with what consumers think. And consumers are in a pretty good place. Our customers are in pretty good place getting a billion dollars back last year. There's plenty - if you look at savings rates and cash and bank accounts and all kinds of stuff, consumers are not - have some pricing ability - there not a lot of pricing pressure coming from consumers each day, so again the count of percentage increases that we need or not so large, you're not talking about double digit price increases that cause everybody to call the insurance regulator and say I don't like this world. So we don't see a lot of consumer pushback. When you look at the regulators we have a good relationship with our regulators. I mean, we were 10 days in last year, I mean, Glenn, I think it was like 10 days into March, we were like we got to do something about this. So we went out proactively to regulators and said, we don't have a requirement to do this, we have no contractual requirement to do it. But we know you'll want us to do it. So we're going to do it in advance upfront and we led the industry in doing that. So we feel like we have good relationships with them, we've been balanced as to how we approach it. And we've been able to earn the economic rents in the marketplace and compete successfully. And Glenn anything, you want to talk about in terms of specifics. Yeah, when rental cars go from 50 bucks a day to $100 a day or used car prices go up 40%, regulators know you got to make - you got to collect more money to take care of that. Well, Paul, thank you for recognizing how successful we've been at home. Like there are days, when I feel like people think the only thing we sell is auto insurance. And like we make a lot of money in homeowners insurance, we're really good at it. It does require lower margins than auto insurance, because you got to put up a lot more capital because of the volatility. And you don't get a lot of investment income. So we've been very good at it. Glenn, do you want to talk about how we're doing this? David, I'll get Glenn to answer the question on frequency. I'm not sure where that 14% to 15% came from, but and how you've factored. What period of time you're focused, is that two years and then one year? Because you can't take a two year trend and extrapolate it onto annual trends is, maybe that's what I heard. But Glenn do you want to talk just about frequency? Well, we don't - we've got - we got plans for the rest of the year is where we think we need to increase price. But we don't give those out for competitive reasons. And we also need to bring traders to agree. So I would just say that we think we will. You should rely on the fact David that we know how to make money and we're focused on making money. As to the competitive business I think it depends what other people do. So you heard yesterday if you listen to the Progressive call they're all in on raising prices, cutting advertising, changing underwriting stuff. So we think that gives us room to adapt and continue to grow, and make money and make sure that we can recover costs as they go up. Other competitors are in different places. But we feel good about where we're at, like trades for growth. Like if you start off and said, would you want to - have a pandemic and a huge drop in frequency for a year to do transformative growth? You probably would say, I don't know, like it's a lot of volatility to manage. On the other hand, I think in our particular case, it's worked well for us. If you look at what they've done then we can really focus on and there have been more rate increases this year than I think probably people would have predicted if you asked them in the fourth quarter of last year. And that would include us, like if you just said, what do we think everybody was going to do this year? We wouldn't have thought they had to go up as much as they did. But we also didn't think severity was going to be as high as it is. So we're increasing ours, and they're increasing theirs. But we think our relative advantage, given our sophistication in pricing, given our reduction in expenses, given what we're doing on the long-term basis to get expenses down even farther, puts us in good place. So we don't see anything happening that tells us we can't still be on the path to grow market share. The specific roads we go down might be a little different. But we're still feeling like that goal is still there or the objective is still achievable. I'm trying to sort through Meyer - the first direct should be priced for what you get like you should get what you pay for. So when you buy Allstate direct, it's I think on average, about 7% lower than if you buy from an agent because it doesn't come with health, and so it's you get what you pay for. And there are people - there are some demographic shifts there. But some of it's not - there are some young people who want help and some older people who don't want help. And so where their focus is not as much on demographics of those channels, but it is the customer value. As it relates to our competitive position in each channel, we believe you should have a competitive price position in each channel, like-for-like, so if you're buying from GEICO or Progressive and you're buying direct and you're buying from Allstate, you're buying direct, you should - it should be the same kind of value. Now, it gets a little dicier when you figure out prices because what the limits are and all kinds of - it's complicated fast. But the conceptual approach would be, be competitive in channel based on the value you deliver to shareholders, or the customers. Glenn how would you - is there other things you'd add to that? So as we go back to that slide where we showed the three different channels, direct is up, as we said it's not 29% of sales, we expected to continue to go up as Glenn said, as we get better. There are some shifts to that channel if you just look globally, some of that's because more people feel comfortable buying over the web and not going through some of that. Some of it is just because direct is a whole bunch of advertising and it drives people to it. But we're, as Glenn pointed out in that boat and increasing our capabilities. But that doesn't mean we're waving the flag on people-to-people exchange. And so the key part of transformer growth is, there are people who want help. We just need to give it them at a lower cost. And that's what we're working on. So people were more than happy to pay a lot of money - not lot, but to be paid for help to buy the insurance, they just don't want to pay you 10% for ongoing service when they can do self-service, it is not much to be done or you can do at a lower cost centrally. So that's our shift and transformer. We're not waving the flag on person-to-person sales. In fact, we're leaning in and saying we have a great position here, we have a great brand, people know us, we just need to do it more effectively and create higher growth models. So that will take us some time to transition. As we talked about, like I don't expect the Allstate agent business to jump up the way you'll see the direct business increase over the next 12 months. But I do think it's got great long-term potential. And we're investing heavily in making sure those agents can deliver what people want if they want help buying products. Short answer would be no, we think we can be really competitive in that market. And we're excited to get into the independent agent channel and do it as quickly as we can. We'll have some of our middle market products this year on the NatGen platform branded as National General and Allstate Company. So we'll get the benefit of the endorsed brand. And then over the next two years, we'll be rolling that out as quickly as we can. Sure. Thanks, Michael. It really is about claims capabilities and paying what you owe, in being fair to folks. But making sure you don't pay more than you owe as things move. So we have inflationary factors, for example, say on materials for homeowners, having purchasing power, and having really good deals in place over the long-term on flooring, on roofing, and other products used in home repair, helps hedge that inflation. And with our size, with our buying power and with the capabilities of our claims team, we've been able to do that helps hedge it. Again, I'm not suggesting it eliminates the problem of inflation. But it does help mitigate it so that not all of that cost is passed through to your customers. Because in our view the job to our customers, obviously we got to put them back to where they were. We've got to charge people an appropriate price and give them the best value possible. And part of that is mitigating the cost of claims. So that was in the purchasing power. The proprietary models I mentioned before, is we've just invested a lot in our analytics and data capabilities over the years in order to flag claims that were at risk for accelerating costs so that we could get it into the right experts hands at the right time and it allows us to do a better quality job on those and also manage the costs. We think it's good. I mean, I think people do want sometimes a little more help on their home because they care more about their home. But we think that those people who are comfortable using advanced technology, bots, chat on assets you can get online should be able to buy more homes direct. Thank you for taking the time. Maybe just close on a few things first on investment results. I totally understand the view that one would not fully count the huge increase in performance spacing. But when I read some of the reports, I'm like I think it's fair to say it was an outsize quarter. But that doesn't mean that our long-term results should be ignored. We're good in investments we had good results. Our acquisitions are performing well, whether that be Allstate protection plans, which we didn't really get questions on today. I just want to remind you we bought that company four years ago at $1.4 billion. It's now over a billion dollars in revenue. It's growing at 27% a year. It made $155 million, which means we paid nine times earnings for business that is growing 27%. So we think it's worth a lot more than that. National General, we also think will be highly successful. But we're off to a really good start there. You can see that in the current numbers. And it's not just the 4 million policies we added. By the way, when you look at the net cash, we had the layout after a stretch to our capital. I do not believe we could have acquired 1% market share by putting a couple of billion dollars into advertising. So we think it was also just an economic growth opportunity straight up, forget the strategic potential for the growth. And then share repurchases we continue to really do well. This is the biggest share repurchase program we've ever announced both in dollars and percentage of market capitalization that's build up. So, thank you for participating today. We had great results this quarter. We look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "content": "Thanks Tom. Turning to Slide 7, let's dive deeper into near-term results on our multifaceted approach to grow property-liability market share. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, property-liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by National General and growth in Allstate brand new business. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies, and Allstate brand property-liability policies increased in the quarter driven by growth in homeowners and other personal lines. Allstate brand auto policies in force declined slightly compared to the prior year quarter, but increased sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, including growth of 111,000 policies compared to prior year and as you can see by the table on the lower left. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to prior year. We continue to make progress in building higher growth business models, as we look to achieve leading positions in all three primary distribution channels. The middle section of the chart on the right shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 6.7% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents excluding new appointments, and a 31% increase in the direct channel more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. The addition of National General also added 481,000 new auto applications in the quarter. Let's turn to Slide 8 to review property-liability margin results in the second quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 95.7 increased 5.9 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased losses relative to the historically low auto accident frequency experienced in the prior year quarter due to the pandemic. Increased losses were partially offset by lower pandemic related expenses, primarily shelter in place paybacks in 2020, as well as lower catastrophe losses. These are represented by the green bars in the combined ratio reconciliation chart on the lower left of the slide. Shifting to the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure. This enables improvement in the competitive price position of auto insurance, and investments in marketing and technology while maintaining strong returns. The total property-liability expense ratio of 24.7 in the second quarter decreased by 7.1 points compared to the prior year, again, driven by lower Coronavirus related expenses. This was partially offset by the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General, restructuring charges, and a 0.7 point increase from higher investment in advertising. Excluding these items as shown by the dark blue bars, the expense ratio decreased by 0.4 points in the second quarter, compared to the prior year period, decreased 1.7 points below year end 2019 and 2.5 points below year end 2018 reflecting continued progress and improving cost efficiencies. Claims expenses have also been reduced through innovations such as QuickFoto Claim, Virtual Assist and aerial imagery, which also improves the customer experience. These claim improvements are not reflected in the expense ratio, but are in the loss ratio and also helped maintain margins. Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss how our auto insurance profitability which remains very strong, and is still favorable to pre-pandemic levels, despite pandemic driven volatility. Allstate protection auto underlying combined ratio finished at 91.8. As you can see from the chart, the level remains favorable to 2017 through 2019 historical second quarter and year end levels despite increasing by 9.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects a comparison to a period with historically low auto accident frequencies. The improvement relative to historical levels is driven by auto accident frequency remaining below pre-pandemic levels, partly offset by auto severity increases and competitive pricing enhancements. To illustrate the pandemic driven volatility, Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency increased 47.3% from the prior year quarter, but is 21% lower than the same period in 2019. Auto severity increases persisted relative to the prior year quarter and pre-pandemic periods across coverages largely driven by the shift in mix to more severe higher speed auto accidents and rising inflationary impacts in both used car values and replacement part costs. The incurred severity increases are running higher than general inflation, which are reflected in the reported combined ratio. To counteract rising severity we are leveraging advanced claim capabilities, predictive modeling, advanced photo and video utilization and deep expertise in repair process management to enable a scaled response to inflation and supply constraints. Targeted price increases will also be implemented as necessary to maintain attractive auto insurance returns. Now let's shift to Slide 10, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. Net investment income totaled $974 million in the quarter, which was $754 million above the prior year quarter driven by higher performance based income as shown in the chart on the left Performance-based income totaled $649 million in the second quarter, as shown in grey, reflecting both idiosyncratic and broad based valuation increases in private equity investments, and to a lesser extent gains from the sale of real estate equity. Market-based income shown in blue was $3 million above the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest bearing portfolio yield was mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. Our total portfolio return in the second quarter totaled 2.6% reflecting income as well as higher fixed income and equity valuations. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit of risk over appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value. We draw upon a deep and experienced team of roughly 350 professionals to leverage expertise and asset allocation, portfolio construction, fundamental research, field leadership, quantitative methods, manager selection and risk management. While the results for this quarter were exceptionally strong, particularly for the performance-based investments, we manage the portfolio with a longer term view on returns. At the right we have provided our annualized portfolio returns over a three, five and 10 year horizon. As disclosed in our investors supplement our performance based portfolio has delivered an attractive 12% IRR over the last 10 years, which compares favorably to relevant public and private market comparisons. Our performance-based strategy takes a longer term view, where we seek to deliver attractive, absolute and risk adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk. Moving to Slide 11, protection services continues to grow revenue and profit. Revenues excluding the impact of realized0 gains and losses increased 27.1% to $581 million in the second quarter. The increase was driven by continued rapid growth in Allstate protection plans, and expanding marketing services at Arity due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparent.ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition. Policies in force increased 15.5% to 147 million, also driven by Allstate protection plans, and supported by the successful launch with the Home Depot in the first quarter. Adjusted net income was $56 million in the second quarter, representing an increase of $18 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by profitable growth at Allstate protection plans and profits at Arity and Allstate identity protection. Allstate protection plans generated adjusted net income of $42 million in the second quarter and $155 million over the past 12 months. Now, let's move to Slide 12, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns in the second quarter, with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months, which was 5.8 points higher than the prior year. Excellent capital management and strong financial results have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of $562 million in share repurchases and $245 million in common stock dividends. We announced the acquisition of SafeAuto in June, leveraging National General's success in integrating companies to accelerate growth. The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed in the third quarter. And yesterday the Board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by March 31, 2023. This represents approximately 13% of our current market capitalization. This new authorization continues Allstate's strong track record of providing cash returns to shareholders and reflects in part, the deployable capital generated by the sale of our life and annuity businesses. Moving to Slide 13, it should be clear that Allstate is an attractive investment opportunity. When you invest in Allstate you get ownership of a company with advanced capabilities and a clear strategy, delivering superior financial results relative to peers and the broader market. The table below shows Allstate across key financial metrics over the past five years compared to the S&P 500 and property casualty insurance peers with a market cap of $4 billion or more. As you can see by the four measures on the top operating EPS, operating return on average equity, cash yield and total shareholder return, Allstate is consistently ranked in the top two or three amongst its peers. In the case of operating EPS and cash yield to common shareholders, Allstate is in the top 10% and top 15% respectively, compared to the S&P 500. Moving down one row, Allstate's top line revenue growth relative to peers and the S&P 500 is in the middle of the pack. We are committed to accelerating top line performance through transformative growth and innovating protection while continuing to deliver excellent financial results. Moving down to the price to earnings ratio, Allstate is well below average, eight out of 10 P&C peers and in the 10th percentile amongst the S&P 500. This is an attractive valuation, given our market leading capabilities, excellent returns, future growth prospects and commitment to accelerate growth. Now, let me turn it back over to Tom."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release, investor supplement and posted related materials on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2020 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Thanks, Mark. Good morning everybody. We appreciate you making the time to follow-up on Allstate to see how we're doing. Let's start on Slide 2. On the left our strategy has two components, which is to increase personal property liability market share, and then secondly, to expand protection services, which are shown in those two logos. And we made substantial progress in executing that this quarter. Many of those things that we'll talk about on the right-hand side, were really a year plus in the making, but you see it all coming together this quarter. So, we closed on the acquisition National General in January enhancing our competitive position in the independent agent distribution. We executed agreement to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company at New York, two separate deals there and that will redeploy capital out of the lower growth and return businesses and reduces our exposure to interest rate risk. We also can make continued progress on getting higher growth in our personal property liability business, moving into Phase 3 of Transformative Growth. Total revenues increased by 26.2% at quarter, which is an outstanding number. Policies in force increased by 20.6%. And of course, that's driven in large part by the National General acquisition. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in the call. A long-term approach to creating shareholder value in both investing and using reinsurance also benefited results this quarter. We hit substantial increase in performance-based income and reinsurance recoveries. Allstate Protection Plans continues its rapid growth. We launched Home Depot earlier this quarter. We had strong operating results with adjusted net income of $1.9 billion or $6.11 a share and it generated a return on equity over the last 12 months of 23.2%. And then shareholders also benefited with a $765 million of dividends in share repurchases. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3 and go through the first quarter financial results. Our revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 26.2% to the prior year quarter. And that reflects both the National General acquisition, higher investment income and realized capital gains. Property-liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 11.4% and 12.1% respectively. Our performance-based income was $378 million versus a loss in the first quarter of 2020. We did have a net loss of $1.4 billion that was recorded in a quarter, which there was a $4 billion loss on the dispositions on those announced sales of the two life insurance companies. And that was not fully offset by the strong operating performance. The strong operating performance charter did create that adjusted net income of about $1.9 billion, as you can see from the table on the bottom. And that's 55.7% higher than the prior year quarter as reduced auto claim frequency and higher net investment income, more than offset increased catastrophe losses. Let's go to Slide 4 digging a little on National General, which is an excellent growth platform for us. We acquired the business for $4 billion in January and that's to grow market share within the independent agent channel. And National General has appointments with over 42,000 independent agents. That expands our product portfolio as well includes non-standard auto insurance, where we had a very small presence, lender-placed homeowners insurance, accident and health insurance and two digital marketing platforms. National General\u2019s agency-facing technology is effective, efficient and scalable. So we're a better owner for National General, since it improves the independent agent business, it lowers costs and it will generate incremental growth from here. It will become a top five independent agent carrier.  And then the combination of Allstate's standard auto and homeowners insurance expertise with National General's expertise in non-standard auto insurance, will give us a really broad portfolio of products to provide to independent agents. Significant expense reductions are expected by consolidating Allstate\u2019s to independent agent businesses onto National General's technology and operating platform. And the cost to acquire these in force policies, which is about one point of our market share at the net acquisition price is comparable to doing this organically. Now we have three measures of success through these acquisitions. You can see in the bottom of the table, accretion to earnings, achieve expense synergies and grow IA channel policies in force. We\u2019re only a quarter into it, but we had a really strong start on these goals. We put Glenn and the team, [indiscernible] have been working on this really since the six months we started the deal in July six months before we bought it. So we came into this first quarter with a head of steam. And the Allstate protection segment added $1.3 billion in net written premiums, $138 million in underwriting income this quarter. Allstate Health and Benefits increase adjusted net income by $35 million. We are integrating Encompass onto the National General platform and are on pace to achieve our expense synergies. We also expect to grow policies enforced by broadening that product portfolio in IA channel. And of course, that represents about a third of the total person lines market. The IA channel policies in force are approximately six times larger after this transaction, as we add standard auto and homeowners insurance products to National General\u2019s offering later this year that will drive even more growth. Let me now turn it over to Mario to go through the first quarter results in more detail.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. And good morning everybody. Let's go to Slide five and delve a little deeper into Property Liability growth. Property Liability policies in force grew by 12.1%, compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 3.9 million policies. The Allstate brand grew policies by 0.5% due to growth in homeowners and other personal lines as you can see by the table on the left. Allstate brand auto insurance was flat to the prior year, as increased new business was offset by lower retention. The chart on the lower right shows a breakdown of personal auto, new issued applications compared to the prior year, which increased 64% in total, primarily due to the incremental 526,000 applications generated by National General. The middle section of the chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 5.4% increase in new business growth, compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents and a large increase in direct channel sales, more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents, as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. As a result, property liability net written premium grew 13.7% in the first quarter compared to prior year, driven by a 12.9% increase in auto insurance and a 20.3% increase in homeowners insurance. The auto insurance net written premium increase was driven by a 14.1% increase in policies in force due to National General and increased new business \u2013 new issued applications across all brands. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average auto insurance premiums from approved rate decreases and lower retention, partially driven by the impact of special payment plans that were implemented during the pandemic. If you flip to Slide 6, you see property-liability margins remain strong. The recorded combined ratio of 83.3, improved 1.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily from a lower underlying loss ratio driven by reduced auto frequency and continued cost savings. The auto insurance recorded combined ratio of 80.5, was 8.8 points below the prior year, primarily due to lower accident frequency in the quarter. Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency remained below prior year levels in 47 of 51 geographies, which includes the District of Columbia. The chart on the lower left shows the impact of the pandemic on Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency. As you can see the onset of the pandemic and efforts to slow the spread of the virus had a large impact on frequency beginning at the end of the first quarter of last year, and then extending into the second quarter when auto frequency was at its lows. This timeframe coincided with Allstate's shelter in place payback. Following the second quarter of 2020 property damage frequency has trended below pre-pandemic levels by approximately 28%, as you can see by the third and fourth quarter variances to 2019. And first quarter of 2021 frequency showed a comparable decline relative to 2019. As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure, enabling us to improve the competitive position of auto insurance, while maintaining strong returns. The property liability expense ratio improved 2.5 points in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the prior year due to the absence of coronavirus-related expenses incurred in 2020, such as the shelter in place payback as well as continued cost reductions. This was partially offset by a significant increase in advertising investment. The expense ratio, excluding coronavirus-related expenses, restructuring charges, and the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General was 22.8, an improvement of 0.5 points compared to the prior year quarter. In connection with the anticipated benefits associated with the future work environment, we expect to incur approximately $110 million in restructuring costs during 2021 with $33 million recognized in the first quarter, primarily related to real estate exit costs. These restructuring costs and their future benefits are incremental to the $290 million of aggregate restructuring costs related to transformative growth, which we announced in the third quarter of 2020 and of which we've recognized $256 million to date including $17 million this quarter. Let's move to Slide 7 to discuss our progress on building transformative growth business models. So transformative growth is a multi-year initiative to build a low cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing marketing sophistication and investment and building new technology ecosystems. A longitudinal plan segments transformative growth into five phases, starting with the conceptual design and ending with the retirement of the old business model. We've completed Phase 1 and much of Phase 2. In Phase 2, the auto insurance competitive position has been improved leading to higher close rates. This was supported by cost reductions. Direct capabilities have been expanded and sales volumes are increasing. New branding has been launched and marketing investment has been increased. This combined with industry-leading telematics capabilities will increase growth. We believe Allstate is among the leaders in telematics and is the largest pay-per-mile provider through Milewise, which offers lower costs for customers who drive less. We've also expanded independent agent distribution through the National General acquisition. Looking forward, we are now into Phase 3 in building the new operating model. We will support the transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost models. New agent models are also being tested to serve customers who want a local agent. Improving customer acquisition costs relative to lifetime value will lower costs. Expense reductions will support increased investment in growth and technology. The new customer experience and product management technology ecosystems also get deployed in this phase. Now let's go to Slide 8, which highlights investment performance for the first quarter. Net investment income totaled $708 million in the quarter, which was $462 million above the prior year quarter driven by a higher performance based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $378 million in the first quarter as shown in gray, reflecting broad based valuation increases in private equity investments and sales of underlying real estate investments. Market-based income shown in blue was $6 million below the prior year quarter with lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest bearing portfolio yield reducing income. Our first quarter GAAP total portfolio return was minus 0.2% as you can see on the bottom of the left chart, reflecting lower fixed income valuations. Over the last 12 months, the total return was 8.8%. As discussed previously, our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon with higher, but more volatile return expectations. This volatility can be seen by the chart on the lower right. It highlights the one, five and 10-year performance-based internal rates of return. The one year trends has been volatile throughout the pandemic with the two most recent quarters, significantly higher than the returns experienced during the middle of 2020. Conversely, the five and 10-year trends are stable and closer to our expected returns. Moving to Slide 9. Allstate Protection Plans continues to grow revenue and profit. As you recall, we purchased Allstate Protection Plans for $1.4 billion in 2017 to broaden the protection solutions offered to customers. It provides low cost protection with excellent service. Products are primarily sold for U.S. retailers and leverage the Allstate brand. Since acquisition, Allstate Protection Plans has experienced rapid top-line growth and improved profitability. Revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 48% over the last three years, as you can see on the bottom left. And we're more than $1 billion over the latest 12 months. Adjusted net income went from a loss of $22 million in 2017 to income of $148 million over the last 12 months. Additional growth will be achieved by further expanding appliance furniture and mobile phone protection, expanding the geographic footprint outside the U.S. and creating new innovative services such as two-day appliance repair. This acquisition has been an incredible success for us. Now let's move to Slide 10, which highlights Allstate attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.2% for the last 12 months, which was 5.7 points higher than the prior year. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth. We provided significant cash returns to shareholders in the first quarter through a combination of $601 million in share repurchases and $164 million in common stock dividends. The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Given our growth strategy and sustainable earnings potential, we announced a 50% increase in the quarterly common shareholder dividend to $0.81 paid to shareholders on April 1. The total cash return provided to shareholders was 7.8% of average market capitalization over the last 12 months. With that context, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. So it looks like there's very good success in the allstate.com direct model. Can we talk a little about whether we shuttered the purchasing through Esurance and the sort of flows we're seeing on the new policy apps on the allstate.com site?\nTom Wilson: Glenn, do you want to take that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Sure. Yes. So we have not completely shuttered Esurance. What we've done is we've redirected our marketing dollars from the Esurance brand to the Allstate brand. And in addition to that, we've invested more in the Allstate brand as well. So \u2013 but part of that was being able to move that marketing. So while Esurance has trailed down, we're still taking advantage of the goodwill that we've paid for over years of that brand. And the fact that people recognize it, still find the Esurance out there and they have good products for a portion of our market. So we're still selling some there, but the growth is absolutely being driven by the Allstate brand. As you saw in the supplement that or the Q, we've got 33% increase in direct sold business. So it's really taking off and we've got more capacity going into that system, because a direct system is \u2013 I won't say only limited, but a main limiter would be your capacity, your sales capacity in there. So we're growing the contact center, improving web flows and really growing the Allstate branded direct sold business. [Indiscernible] as you know, is part of transformative growth, we're also building a new technology ecosystem, a product management system and a customer experience system. As that gets rolled out, we will shutdown the Esurance system and then we will stop selling products under the Esurance thing. But we have some time to do that.\nJosh Shanker: And the 278,000 new policy apps at Allstate direct, are those apples-to-apples with the 200 or so that you sold one year ago, or was that part of a joint direct captive sort of relationship where we're directly the lead generator or are they complete apples-to-apples those two types of new applications?\nTom Wilson: Glenn, do you want to take?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. Sure. Yes, it would be an apples-to-apples. It's basically just think about customers that come to us by either clicking or calling directly into an 800 number as opposed to the customers that come to us through an agent. So it would be an apples-to-apples comparison.\nJosh Shanker: And can we talk about National General, Encompass and Allstate brand through independent agents, is Encompass going to be called National General, even though the National General and Encompass products are kind of a different target customer and what would be wrong with calling the product Allstate?\nTom Wilson: Well, let me take the branding question then Glenn can fill in how we're doing the transition, because it's different for Encompass than it is for the Allstate independent agent. So first from a branding standpoint, we've decided that the Allstate brand and personal property liability will be on business that we control both the sales and the service on it. So that's both the Allstate agents and then direct whether that's a web or call center. For the independent agent business, we've rebranded National General. So it's National General and Allstate company and we launch it, I think beginning of January. So that you get the relationship with Allstate, but that everybody understands that it's separate than that, which you would get from an Allstate agent. We do not do that with the Allstate brand in the circle of protection. So for example, we sell under the Allstate name at Walmart, sell under the Allstate name at Home Depot, at target, which gives us both increased exposure to customers, enables us to further leverage that capability. And quite honestly, it's helped us dramatically expand Allstate protection products because of the power of their brand. So slightly different strategy from a branding standpoint, inside the personal property liability markets and outside, but we try to leverage it everywhere we can, but provide, make sure that that brand stands for certain things in different areas. Glenn, do you want to talk about your plans to both integrate Encompass and Allstate independent agents into National General and then Josh\u2019s question on branding at the same time.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So thanks Josh, because I think it's an interesting question because I think if you take from a legacy standpoint, National General and what it was best that known for in Encompass and what is best that known for, it would be different as we suggested. But as Tom just pointed out National General and Allstate company, that's going to be a different story. We're launching middle market products. So think about basically the Allstate product capability in the middle market auto and home and other personal lines. On the National General platform and branded as National General and Allstate company starting in the second half of this year and then really fast expansion. So it would be to all 50 States within 18 months of the start of that. So before the end of next year. So really National General and Allstate company is going to be a company that is serving from nonstandard up through a mass affluent, and everything in between. It really is another national player in the independent agent space. And we've gotten a phenomenal reaction from independent agents and they are genuinely excited to have another significant player and with the capabilities of Allstate, National General combined in that market. And so we're positioned really well to grow with a lot of greenfield ahead of us in the independent agent space.\nJosh Shanker: The Encompass name will disappear?\nTom Wilson: It will be at part of National General and Allstate company, correct. Whether we grow the policies to a new policy or leave the policy outstanding under the Encompass name and basically put National General stuff on top of it, it would just depend on the cost of it. And Encompass, it goes first and the Allstate independent agent, which is Allstate brand products sold through independent agents in rural spaces where it was not economic to have a captive agent, mostly there's a few places where it didn't work that way, but mostly that will transition over time as well.\nJosh Shanker: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first I guess for Glenn or Mario, but the question on just auto \u2013the auto business. How do you see the interplay between the frequency and pricing? And it seems like everybody's had very good margins in personal auto over the last several quarters. At what point do you see sort of pricing catch up to that? And in that environment, do you think if the market stays competitive; are you still in a position to grow your discount?\nTom Wilson: Let me provide an overview and then Glenn if you want to jump onto this one. So first I'm going to go up a little bit. First, it's about how do we think about increasing market share and we'll use two words together profitable growth. We put them together because that's what we want. We do not believe that growth with no profit is good for shareholders. So the objective of course is maximize shareholder value. Our expected outcomes for our team are that they will balance between growth and profitability. Our strategy of course is as Mario talked about in the first phase, second phase of transforming growth is getting more competitive auto insurance product. And we supported that, of course in worse being successful by reducing our costs. So the first thing would be we can control our costs and we can make sure that if we reduce prices to get more competitive, we still maintain our margins. Obviously, we want to be smarter whether that be how we price or how we acquire business and our marketing and we're also using telematics. And then as we go forward with transformative growth, it'll be by being faster with better technology and having new products affordable, simple and connected that are sold through that broad range of distribution that Glenn was just talking about from direct to Allstate agents. So Glenn, do you want to jump in on the specifics?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So first I'll talk about frequency a little bit and then go to competitive position. So from frequency standpoint, what we're \u2013 everybody has benefited from some lower frequency. But we've also looked at a deeper level at it, but then just sort of miles driven and the number of accidents coming out, because there are differences by books and you see differences in competitors as to how much tailwind that's providing. So, we look at the fact that commuter driven or take it from rush hour losses are down about three points more than overall losses. And we look at rural driving is down about four or five points less than urban driving. And so we look at these that are pretty deep level, and we we're fortunate to work with Arity and have a lot of data on this with 10 years plus of telematics that we get pretty granular into how we're looking at it and understanding the frequency picture. So we've got a tailwind with that, which takes me into competitive position because we've been moving our competitive position pretty aggressively. Like you see a minus 1.5 on average premium, and that might feel or seem slight, but there's a lot underneath that. We've moved new business pricing. We've moved telematic pricing. We've reduced the cost of our Milewise program. That's grown really nicely and all of that is inside of there. So our competitive position on the price changes we've made and that are still going into market have really improved. And our close rates are up. We're starting to see those really positive signs of momentum across multiple states.  And then you put on top of that, the fact that some of our competitors have already taken price increases, some of those out there. We've heard others say that they're going to start taking bites at the apple in terms of price increases. And you look at our position and obviously we're in a position right now. We continue to invest in growth. We can still put money into marketing. We could still put money into competitive price position because of where we're positioned, which really puts us in a great spot to grow going forward.\nJimmy Bhullar: And then just any comments on your views on if growth to the extent you're able to quantify or give a range on how I'm assuming it should trend higher later this year and into next year as you're implementing some of these initiatives in direct and independent agency, but to whatever extent you can quantify or give us an idea do you expect it to be?\nTom Wilson: Well, we're not \u2013 we don't give forecast on if growth or frequency or case tasks, these things you can't predict. Let me talk about growth a little bit, because it is really an important question that many analysts have. And of course it drives huge value in the market today. And so we were starting to have first actuals matter and we had a great quarter. I mean, over 25% revenue growth, our fifth growth was in the low teens. And we're headed towards increasing our market share pretty significantly in personal lines this year, which is consistent with our strategy. I guess what we set out to do? Now, you'd have some naysayers and say, well, you bought it with the acquisition of National General. And that's of course true. But you always have to investigate market share. In this case, it is real growth. And we look at it and said, if we had taken the net price that we paid for National General and thrown it into marketing or higher commissions or some kind of spiff. It likely would have given us less growth than we got. And certainly not the kind of profitability we're getting from it. The same thing, but we did buy it. But we did the same thing with Allstate protection plans, right? We bought SquareTrade. We repositioned it with our brands and that acquired growth and turned into an organic growth platform. We expect the same thing to happen with National General. The difference is we paid a slightly higher premium for SquareTrade than we did for National General. As it relates to the Allstate brand, we have multiple ways to grow, right. We got the Allstate agents and we're making \u2013 helping them transition to a new model. We have the direct business, which we've launched in is so by the way, at a different price than through an agent, because we believe customers should pay for what they get. And if you get an agent and get that help, you should be willing to pay for that. And so overall we feel like the Allstate brand is positioned for long-term growth as well. And so we feel like we've got an overall plan to move forward, has got transformative growth in it. It's got real growth this quarter and it's got \u2013 we're building platforms and we'll continue that growth going forward.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. My first question will be on reinsurance. Tom, I was hoping you could just give us an overview of how reinsurance helps the company this quarter. And then I know you did file your reinsurance update piece and maybe talk about what's changing going forward. I did note that the costs in the first quarter about 14% higher versus a year ago is that the type of cost or increase we should expect for the full year.\nTom Wilson: Greg, let me start with this strategic perspective on it, and then either Maria or Glenn, if you want to talk about the first quarter. So I'm going to go back a long way. But in 2004 and 2005 we had huge catastrophe losses. We weren't earning any money on the homeowner's business. We'd make some money one year and we would lose money the next year. When you looked at over time, I think this is not a really good business. So we looked at getting out and we said what \u2013 if we were out, we'd want to be in, because it does, our customers do want it. So maybe it's just this catastrophe risk they don't want. So we created a very comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program to basically divest certain portions of the risk we took on. And that's evolved over time. We have a very sophisticated multi-year program. It's got \u2013 it's by stated got different by event. It's got the aggregate in it. And we bear that cost each and every quarter, obviously that comes through. And then sometimes it pays off. And what you saw this quarter was the aggregate kicked in. And so from losses, some of the losses, which were last year showed up as reducing our catastrophe losses this quarter, which were upgraded significantly. And that helps smooth it out. And we've looked at that from what kind of return on capital do we give up to the reinsurers and we're quite comfortable giving up the return that they get to avoid the volatility that comes from it. And so it's helped us reposition the homeowners business, so that now it's a very consistent source of profitability for us. As I was saying to the prior question, we don't believe in growth with like running homeowners above a 100 is not a good plan and you're destroying value at that point with growth. And we don't believe in that. So we've used reinsurance to help reposition the business. We did a whole bunch of other stuff including changing the product and changing the way we price and how we underwrite it, where \u2013 how we do our segmentation by down to specific risks codes. So how we pay for roofs, there's a whole bunch of stuff we've changed underneath that over the last decade. But it's a really good business. In reinsurance, using that reinsurers helped us get there. So what you saw this quarter was a benefit, which is more than was earned in this quarter, but it was paid for in the prior quarter. So if you \u2013 some people want to exclude it from this year's quarter, totally get that. Unlike that's fine. But then you should not be counting all the costs from the other time. Mario, Glenn, do you want to talk about the cost of reinsurance and the program going forward? \nMario Rizzo: Sure. I can jump in on that Tom. And just to give you a little color, Greg, on the benefits in the quarter. We recovered about $955 million in the quarter on a net basis. Part of that was from our per occurrence nationwide program where we retain the first $500 million of an event. And then we have coverage up \u2013 in our current program up to $5 billion. And then as Tom mentioned, we also have an aggregate cover, which is about $1 billion, which spans a 12-month period. We also had recoveries under that. So combined, it was about $955 million. That's net of reinstatement premiums in the quarter, and it was principally on the freeze event in Texas. So the freeze event on a net basis cost us $586 million in the quarter. Once you start peeling back the prior year component of that reinsurance recovery, which was about $150 million. You get to a gross loss in Texas north of $1.3 billion. So we've benefited pretty significantly in the quarter from our reinsurance program. As you mentioned, we posted on our website \u2013 we placed most of the nationwide program this quarter and we still have a component of the nationwide program to do. And then remember we have a separate Florida program. The costs year-over-year, because we've included National General in this year's program. It\u2019s going to be slightly higher than it was a year ago when you add up what we were spending on reinsurance and what National General was spending on reinsurance. But in terms of what you saw in the first quarter, you got to remember, that's still last year's program that was placed May 1. And what we saw last year was the increase we experienced was mainly in the Florida program. And you're seeing that kind of cycle through in the first quarter. We will start incurring the cost of this year's program when it incepts which is on June 1.\nGreg Peters: That was a thorough answer. I appreciate it. I'd like to pivot to the expense ratio on Page 6 of the presentation slide deck you are continuing every quarter to show improvement in almost every quarter and show improvement in your expense ratio. And I guess when we think about the sustainability or more importantly, is this a trend that we should continue to expect forever? Obviously, I don't think your expense ratio is going to zero, but the improvement is noteworthy. And then just as in the slide, I did notice that the expense ratio was up in the Allstate protection home business. So, I'm curious if there was something unusual on that?\nTom Wilson: So, overall, Greg you are right our strategy to get a more competitive in auto insurance pricing, which was Phase 2 [indiscernible] transformed to growth, included taking down costs. And as you know, we did a large reduction in force last year, did about 3,800 people starting to see that come through this year. At the same time, our advertising was way up. And so, we try to balance between those two. I don't think you could expect it to come down half a point every quarter from now till an infinite item. You should know that our strategy is to both keep reducing cost every place we can so that we can have a more affordable product for our customers and therefore a better price. So, we get more of them. But not invest in growth, because if the kind of a return on capital we're getting in these businesses, we should definitely be seeking more growth. Mario, do you want to talk more about what you \u2013 this current quarter and what the ins and outs were?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Thanks Craig. So, I guess, it's not mentioned. We're going to continue to focus on reducing our cost structure. And like we said, really all along, our focus on reducing our cost structure is not a margin expansion focus, it's a growth focus. And it's a growth focus because reducing our costs enables us to invest more in growth. And you saw it this quarter where we invested more in marketing and the component of our underwriting expense ratio related to marketing actually increased by nine tenths of a point. Yet it was more than offset by the operating cost reductions that Tom referenced from last year. So, real ins and outs were more investment in advertising, more than offset by cost reductions and net-net a half a point improvement in kind of the underlying expense ratio in the quarter. And we're going to continue to focus on moving that number down. The other thing I'd mentioned on expenses, and it's not obvious in our numbers is, part of our focus on cost reduction has been on getting more efficient in claim handling. And we've improved the efficiency in our loss adjustment expense, which comes through the loss ratio. But again, we consider it as a core part of our cost reduction efforts to improve the combine \u2013 improve the cost structure, creates a path we need to invest and be able to grow more and continue to deliver excellent return. So, I think what you saw in the quarter was really kind of proof of, of how that strategy is playing out. In terms of the homeowner expense ratio specifically, Greg, I'd have to go back and take a look at what components of it \u2013 whether it came through distribution costs, or underwriting costs, whether it was like inspections, and so on. So let me take that one offline and I'll get back to you on that one.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thank you for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a lot of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your question, please.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call. Congratulations on the quarter. I was hoping you could expand a little bit more about what it means to transition the existing through agents to a different model. We get emails from agents all the time. Usually, they are worried about this or that. Is this a transition that's really towards more of an independent agent type structure with equations, or are we talking to something that's completely out of book? Or if it's sort of to be determined?\nTom Wilson: Let me provide a little view and then Glenn can tell you some of the specifics of what we're doing. But Paul first thing I would say is now we're not going to do the nationwide deal and turn them all into independent agents. We don't think that makes sense from a customer standpoint. Customers come to us because they love the Allstate brand. We have a really strong brand, long relationships, so we're not planning on turning them into something else. And obviously the fast pace of change has all of this on it, whether you're a retailer or anybody what's going on in the world. And the good news for our agents is that still a majority of consumers want an insurance professional help them buy insurance. And our agents are really good at it. That said, people are more comfortable with self-service, simple items and the technology enables a computer to do some of the work that used to be handled in by people and stellar in some cases handle the local offices. So we have to transition their model and go where the customer is going. And so that includes maybe we don't have to use as much real estate as we use today. We certainly do not need to do as much service work in agent offices. So, we have a little over 10,000 Allstate agents. There's probably 26,000 to 27,000 people working in those agencies. Some of those people are doing service work. And we think we can do that either centrally at a lower cost and be more effective for our customers, or just get the computer to do it. Nobody does it at all. So, we have to figure out how do we transition those people in those offices to doing service work, to doing sales work. Or if they can't transition those licensed sales professionals, have the agents build up staff, they can move into that. So last year, one of the things that Glenn and team did was they raised new business commissions to incent, to give people the opportunity to invest more, and sell more things to more people and get more people selling for them. To offset that and continue to make sure we're meeting our customers\u2019 cost needs, we slightly reduced renewal commissions to reflect that. So, if you're an agent and you're focused on new sales, that's a good thing. You're excited about it, you are off and ready to go. If you've been focused more on service and not on growth, then you are not going to be as excited about that change because it changes your business model. So, we have to help them transition from where they are to the place where the customers want us to go, which is they want help, but they want to do it in technologically efficient, low-cost way. And we think that there's a good way to do it. Glenn can give you some examples of what we're doing with our existing agents. We've already talked about what we're doing direct to serve our customers. And then we're also trying some new models that Glenn can talk about, that do the same thing, which is use people to help people buy insurance in a local space, but at a lower cost. Glenn, do you want to give them some more specifics on that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes, absolutely. And Paul, Tom hit a lot of the really important points here. But a couple bear repeating, so no harm being repetitive, but it's really important. So, it's a hard no on the IAP. So, I'll just reiterate, as Tom said, we are dedicated to our exclusive agent model completely. And we believe that there is a not only a meaningful place, but a huge place for our exclusive agents to grow in the market because as Tom said, most consumers still want to work with an agent. So, in the presentation materials that talked about higher growth, lower cost models, so, I'll just hit a couple of things. Lower cost, we've been really reticent in the past to allow agents to consolidate locations or to even go in some cases without real estate or reduce their real estate footprint. We've been very focused on a model that is how many signs do you have up across the countryside. And we're going to really lean in to allowing agents to reduce costs in the way they run their business. And Tom talked a bit about the service. We started that in 2019 and we built it up a bit and everything, but we really have to get to a centralized, and more efficient and effective way of serving customers than separately across 10,000 different locations. And we can take a lot of cost out of the system and reduce the cost for the agents so that they can focus on growth. From a higher growth standpoint, it's about leaning in, on the marketing that they do, that we can help them do more effectively and efficiently as a large enterprise, the lead management that they do, compensating them more for new business, as Tom mentioned also. That's the existing agents and how we want to transition that to higher growth, lower costs. The new models, for example, and we have several hundred of these already in place actually where we are learning from our Canadian operation. Actually, in Canada we have Allstate agents who operate sort of independently from one another. It's not an agent with multiple staff, they are independent workers and producers. And they work on sort of a balance between being in communities, and driving leads themselves and getting leads from the company. And it's been very successful. We're growing very fast in Canada. So, we're leveraging that model and looking at models with no real estate in local markets that are part of the community and are able to take leads and also generate their own leads in that community and grow. So, it's early in the process, but in the second half of the year, we're looking to ramp those up significantly.\nPaul Newsome: I guess, relatedly, could you talk a little bit about any early looks on the pilot programs for new agent recruitment? And if there's some different things that will be happening there in the near future?\nTom Wilson: Glenn, do I take that? Hey Glenn, do you want to take that or maybe you are on mute.\nGlenn Shapiro: My apologies, I did go on mute there. Yes, so we're focused on those new models. I just mentioned in terms of our recruitment right now. And so we have been, I think, \u2013 we have several hundred already and we have a lot more in the pipeline. So, we're looking to grow with those new models. What we're really focused on with the existing agent group, well we\u2019re recruiting sung into the compensation programs that we have as opposed to what we called enhanced compensation program, which was a higher cost model before we're recruiting some into that as more of what you had refer to as a traditional exclusive agent. But the heavier emphasis on our recruiting is on those new models, where with our existing agents, we are really focused on investing to get more of those agents growing and wanting to grow. The good news is they are growing right now. We have increased new business production with our existing established agents. So, when you see the total that somebody referenced earlier, it's slightly down on the overall agency force that is driven by sort of a lack of new appointments, the existing agents, new businesses up year-over-year\nTom Wilson: And Glenn, let me just add last point which is when you see that little red bar on our graph, that was an intentional choice on our part, not a flaw in the system. So, it's not like we decided that, you know what, we were hiring these new agents, we required them to have their own office, we require that they have support staff. To make that work when you have no customers, we're paying 30% upfront commissions which then stayed high for it, not at 30%, but stayed higher than customers should have to pay for them for about five years. And we said what, but this is not the model of the future. We could have kept that going while we develop these new models. And the system would look like it would have been generating more growth than it is today. But we say, economically, that's just not the smart thing to do. Like we're not using shareholders money, right. And that's where we get into which the conversation we\u2019re talking about before is profitable growth. If you're going to [indiscernible] profitable long-term growth, and so you have some bumps, but that's not about a flaw in the system. That's about an intentional choice.\nPaul Newsome: Appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore. Your question, please.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. I guess I wanted to just touch on retention. I was surprised it fell a little bit here again also, especially, given some of the rate actions that you guys have taken. I guess, could you maybe just talk about how much of an impact the lapsing of any billing leniency may have had on the retention, and what your expectations are for retention going forward, like, should we see a snapback here in the second quarter? Yes, I guess that's just my question on retention.\nTom Wilson: David let me provide an overview and Glenn, you can take the impact of the pandemic billing stuff. First, I would say retention is really hard to do attribution on. People leave for all different reasons. And sometimes it's for price, sometimes it's because they move, sometimes it's they bought a new car. And so, it's difficult to get it down to precision to, in a point.  What you do know is if your net promoter score is good and you are doing a better job for customers, they should stay around longer. And if you are competitive in price and you are changing your price not only for new business, which we've done, but also for your existing customers, which we've done, so they have a better price and that should also keep them. But there's lots of different variations. So it's kind of really hard to predict it. Glenn, do you want to talk about how you're feeling about retention this quarter? And again, we have a hard time, nobody really knows how to predict retention.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes, absolutely. So, retention is a lagging metric, first of all I\u2019ll start there. Wherever or whenever a customer decides to cancel, move, shift we record it and report it at the point of what would have been the renewal. So, there's a bit of a lag to that. So, while we stopped the special payment plans during last year, there's still some of that trick going in. So as Tom said, attribution is difficult on this. But there's a portion of it that's related to that. No question. Secondly though it is a highly competitive market right now, shopping is up, advertising is up and there is some impact from that. It's interesting. When you look at National General, as an example, if you saw in some of our disclosures, like National General\u2019s, new business, it's really eye-popping, because National General writes a lot more new business to grow because they have a shorter cycle time. As our business shifts and we look at overall protection business and we're writing in more markets, and we're writing direct and not just through our exclusive agents, that number will move around a little bit on retention, but our focus is to create a lot of new business. We're going to do that. That's what transformative growth is about. We're going to create a lot of new business so that the undulations of retention don't mute our overall growth.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the new business side, obviously great growth, especially on the direct side in new apps. I guess I'm wondering maybe if you could just \u2013 you had kind of mentioned it in your script, but want to just a bit more details on the Milewise offering and how that did this quarter? How big that is as a percentage of the entire book? And was that really the driver behind the direct growth that we saw in the quarter?\nMario Rizzo: Glenn, you can take where we are with Milewise, and number of states and how [indiscernible] you got the done pricing. I would say though, when you just step all the way back, we're about building a digital insurer. And sometimes that gets lost into how big and how successful we are given the size and scale of our company. [Indiscernible] sometimes people look at people who only do that and assume that, they are about to take over the market. We're happy to compete. We feel like we're really doing well in here. We\u2019re early in telematics. We think we're a leader in telematics. And this is an example of a product where we were out early, we're aggressively advertising it and it's resonating. Glenn, do you want to talk about, what you've done to help it grow?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes, absolutely. And to the question of, is it driving the direct growth, I would say, no. Direct growth a majority of that is not Milewise. It's an interesting thing to look at, as Tom said, when you look at it inside a company like Allstate, Milewise will look relatively small. It's up, this year it's something close to in autos. Policies, I think, are foreign change times, autos are six in change times what they were a year prior. So significant growth. If this was a standalone startup sitting outside of a large insurance company like Allstate, it is the largest in the industry pay by mile program. And it would look really big, and really fast growing and really attractive. Inside of Allstate, it is helping our growth, but it is not driving our growth, is the way I'd say that. We're looking to expand over time on Milewise. Right now, it's available to about 50% of consumers across the country. And we have more states lined up for that. It does require the OBD port, which, I think, everybody knows there are chip shortages out there. We have not run into a problem where we have to slow down our \u2013 Milewise at this point. But we are actively managing our supply chain on it because it is a popular product. And we're managing our state expansion and looking at that so that we don't run into a supply chain issues.\nTom Wilson: Thank you for the questions, I think, we're out of time here, it\u2019s top of the hour, and we try to be respectful of your time. Obviously, we appreciate you coming to spend time with us in here about us. We had an excellent quarter the work and you saw from that first slide, the amount of expertise and effort that went into delivering all that for the quarter. It wasn't just this quarter, it's what we do over time, but we feel good about where we're at. So, we've had great operating results as well. So, thank you for your participation. And we'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Glenn Shapiro",
            "content": "Sure. Yes. So we have not completely shuttered Esurance. What we've done is we've redirected our marketing dollars from the Esurance brand to the Allstate brand. And in addition to that, we've invested more in the Allstate brand as well. So \u2013 but part of that was being able to move that marketing. So while Esurance has trailed down, we're still taking advantage of the goodwill that we've paid for over years of that brand. And the fact that people recognize it, still find the Esurance out there and they have good products for a portion of our market. So we're still selling some there, but the growth is absolutely being driven by the Allstate brand. As you saw in the supplement that or the Q, we've got 33% increase in direct sold business. So it's really taking off and we've got more capacity going into that system, because a direct system is \u2013 I won't say only limited, but a main limiter would be your capacity, your sales capacity in there. So we're growing the contact center, improving web flows and really growing the Allstate branded direct sold business. [Indiscernible] as you know, is part of transformative growth, we're also building a new technology ecosystem, a product management system and a customer experience system. As that gets rolled out, we will shutdown the Esurance system and then we will stop selling products under the Esurance thing. But we have some time to do that. Yes. Sure. Yes, it would be an apples-to-apples. It's basically just think about customers that come to us by either clicking or calling directly into an 800 number as opposed to the customers that come to us through an agent. So it would be an apples-to-apples comparison. Yes. So thanks Josh, because I think it's an interesting question because I think if you take from a legacy standpoint, National General and what it was best that known for in Encompass and what is best that known for, it would be different as we suggested. But as Tom just pointed out National General and Allstate company, that's going to be a different story. We're launching middle market products. So think about basically the Allstate product capability in the middle market auto and home and other personal lines. On the National General platform and branded as National General and Allstate company starting in the second half of this year and then really fast expansion. So it would be to all 50 States within 18 months of the start of that. So before the end of next year. So really National General and Allstate company is going to be a company that is serving from nonstandard up through a mass affluent, and everything in between. It really is another national player in the independent agent space. And we've gotten a phenomenal reaction from independent agents and they are genuinely excited to have another significant player and with the capabilities of Allstate, National General combined in that market. And so we're positioned really well to grow with a lot of greenfield ahead of us in the independent agent space. Yes. So first I'll talk about frequency a little bit and then go to competitive position. So from frequency standpoint, what we're \u2013 everybody has benefited from some lower frequency. But we've also looked at a deeper level at it, but then just sort of miles driven and the number of accidents coming out, because there are differences by books and you see differences in competitors as to how much tailwind that's providing. So, we look at the fact that commuter driven or take it from rush hour losses are down about three points more than overall losses. And we look at rural driving is down about four or five points less than urban driving. And so we look at these that are pretty deep level, and we we're fortunate to work with Arity and have a lot of data on this with 10 years plus of telematics that we get pretty granular into how we're looking at it and understanding the frequency picture. So we've got a tailwind with that, which takes me into competitive position because we've been moving our competitive position pretty aggressively. Like you see a minus 1.5 on average premium, and that might feel or seem slight, but there's a lot underneath that. We've moved new business pricing. We've moved telematic pricing. We've reduced the cost of our Milewise program. That's grown really nicely and all of that is inside of there. So our competitive position on the price changes we've made and that are still going into market have really improved. And our close rates are up. We're starting to see those really positive signs of momentum across multiple states.  And then you put on top of that, the fact that some of our competitors have already taken price increases, some of those out there. We've heard others say that they're going to start taking bites at the apple in terms of price increases. And you look at our position and obviously we're in a position right now. We continue to invest in growth. We can still put money into marketing. We could still put money into competitive price position because of where we're positioned, which really puts us in a great spot to grow going forward. Yes, absolutely. And Paul, Tom hit a lot of the really important points here. But a couple bear repeating, so no harm being repetitive, but it's really important. So, it's a hard no on the IAP. So, I'll just reiterate, as Tom said, we are dedicated to our exclusive agent model completely. And we believe that there is a not only a meaningful place, but a huge place for our exclusive agents to grow in the market because as Tom said, most consumers still want to work with an agent. So, in the presentation materials that talked about higher growth, lower cost models, so, I'll just hit a couple of things. Lower cost, we've been really reticent in the past to allow agents to consolidate locations or to even go in some cases without real estate or reduce their real estate footprint. We've been very focused on a model that is how many signs do you have up across the countryside. And we're going to really lean in to allowing agents to reduce costs in the way they run their business. And Tom talked a bit about the service. We started that in 2019 and we built it up a bit and everything, but we really have to get to a centralized, and more efficient and effective way of serving customers than separately across 10,000 different locations. And we can take a lot of cost out of the system and reduce the cost for the agents so that they can focus on growth. From a higher growth standpoint, it's about leaning in, on the marketing that they do, that we can help them do more effectively and efficiently as a large enterprise, the lead management that they do, compensating them more for new business, as Tom mentioned also. That's the existing agents and how we want to transition that to higher growth, lower costs. The new models, for example, and we have several hundred of these already in place actually where we are learning from our Canadian operation. Actually, in Canada we have Allstate agents who operate sort of independently from one another. It's not an agent with multiple staff, they are independent workers and producers. And they work on sort of a balance between being in communities, and driving leads themselves and getting leads from the company. And it's been very successful. We're growing very fast in Canada. So, we're leveraging that model and looking at models with no real estate in local markets that are part of the community and are able to take leads and also generate their own leads in that community and grow. So, it's early in the process, but in the second half of the year, we're looking to ramp those up significantly. My apologies, I did go on mute there. Yes, so we're focused on those new models. I just mentioned in terms of our recruitment right now. And so we have been, I think, \u2013 we have several hundred already and we have a lot more in the pipeline. So, we're looking to grow with those new models. What we're really focused on with the existing agent group, well we're recruiting sung into the compensation programs that we have as opposed to what we called enhanced compensation program, which was a higher cost model before we're recruiting some into that as more of what you had refer to as a traditional exclusive agent. But the heavier emphasis on our recruiting is on those new models, where with our existing agents, we are really focused on investing to get more of those agents growing and wanting to grow. The good news is they are growing right now. We have increased new business production with our existing established agents. So, when you see the total that somebody referenced earlier, it's slightly down on the overall agency force that is driven by sort of a lack of new appointments, the existing agents, new businesses up year-over-year Yes, absolutely. So, retention is a lagging metric, first of all I'll start there. Wherever or whenever a customer decides to cancel, move, shift we record it and report it at the point of what would have been the renewal. So, there's a bit of a lag to that. So, while we stopped the special payment plans during last year, there's still some of that trick going in. So as Tom said, attribution is difficult on this. But there's a portion of it that's related to that. No question. Secondly though it is a highly competitive market right now, shopping is up, advertising is up and there is some impact from that. It's interesting. When you look at National General, as an example, if you saw in some of our disclosures, like National General's, new business, it's really eye-popping, because National General writes a lot more new business to grow because they have a shorter cycle time. As our business shifts and we look at overall protection business and we're writing in more markets, and we're writing direct and not just through our exclusive agents, that number will move around a little bit on retention, but our focus is to create a lot of new business. We're going to do that. That's what transformative growth is about. We're going to create a lot of new business so that the undulations of retention don't mute our overall growth. Yes, absolutely. And to the question of, is it driving the direct growth, I would say, no. Direct growth a majority of that is not Milewise. It's an interesting thing to look at, as Tom said, when you look at it inside a company like Allstate, Milewise will look relatively small. It's up, this year it's something close to in autos. Policies, I think, are foreign change times, autos are six in change times what they were a year prior. So significant growth. If this was a standalone startup sitting outside of a large insurance company like Allstate, it is the largest in the industry pay by mile program. And it would look really big, and really fast growing and really attractive. Inside of Allstate, it is helping our growth, but it is not driving our growth, is the way I'd say that. We're looking to expand over time on Milewise. Right now, it's available to about 50% of consumers across the country. And we have more states lined up for that. It does require the OBD port, which, I think, everybody knows there are chip shortages out there. We have not run into a problem where we have to slow down our \u2013 Milewise at this point. But we are actively managing our supply chain on it because it is a popular product. And we're managing our state expansion and looking at that so that we don't run into a supply chain issues."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Good morning everybody. We appreciate you making the time to follow-up on Allstate to see how we're doing. Let's start on Slide 2. On the left our strategy has two components, which is to increase personal property liability market share, and then secondly, to expand protection services, which are shown in those two logos. And we made substantial progress in executing that this quarter. Many of those things that we'll talk about on the right-hand side, were really a year plus in the making, but you see it all coming together this quarter. So, we closed on the acquisition National General in January enhancing our competitive position in the independent agent distribution. We executed agreement to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company at New York, two separate deals there and that will redeploy capital out of the lower growth and return businesses and reduces our exposure to interest rate risk. We also can make continued progress on getting higher growth in our personal property liability business, moving into Phase 3 of Transformative Growth. Total revenues increased by 26.2% at quarter, which is an outstanding number. Policies in force increased by 20.6%. And of course, that's driven in large part by the National General acquisition. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in the call. A long-term approach to creating shareholder value in both investing and using reinsurance also benefited results this quarter. We hit substantial increase in performance-based income and reinsurance recoveries. Allstate Protection Plans continues its rapid growth. We launched Home Depot earlier this quarter. We had strong operating results with adjusted net income of $1.9 billion or $6.11 a share and it generated a return on equity over the last 12 months of 23.2%. And then shareholders also benefited with a $765 million of dividends in share repurchases. Let's turn to Slide 3 and go through the first quarter financial results. Our revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 26.2% to the prior year quarter. And that reflects both the National General acquisition, higher investment income and realized capital gains. Property-liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 11.4% and 12.1% respectively. Our performance-based income was $378 million versus a loss in the first quarter of 2020. We did have a net loss of $1.4 billion that was recorded in a quarter, which there was a $4 billion loss on the dispositions on those announced sales of the two life insurance companies. And that was not fully offset by the strong operating performance. The strong operating performance charter did create that adjusted net income of about $1.9 billion, as you can see from the table on the bottom. And that's 55.7% higher than the prior year quarter as reduced auto claim frequency and higher net investment income, more than offset increased catastrophe losses. Let's go to Slide 4 digging a little on National General, which is an excellent growth platform for us. We acquired the business for $4 billion in January and that's to grow market share within the independent agent channel. And National General has appointments with over 42,000 independent agents. That expands our product portfolio as well includes non-standard auto insurance, where we had a very small presence, lender-placed homeowners insurance, accident and health insurance and two digital marketing platforms. National General's agency-facing technology is effective, efficient and scalable. So we're a better owner for National General, since it improves the independent agent business, it lowers costs and it will generate incremental growth from here. It will become a top five independent agent carrier.  And then the combination of Allstate's standard auto and homeowners insurance expertise with National General's expertise in non-standard auto insurance, will give us a really broad portfolio of products to provide to independent agents. Significant expense reductions are expected by consolidating Allstate's to independent agent businesses onto National General's technology and operating platform. And the cost to acquire these in force policies, which is about one point of our market share at the net acquisition price is comparable to doing this organically. Now we have three measures of success through these acquisitions. You can see in the bottom of the table, accretion to earnings, achieve expense synergies and grow IA channel policies in force. We're only a quarter into it, but we had a really strong start on these goals. We put Glenn and the team, [indiscernible] have been working on this really since the six months we started the deal in July six months before we bought it. So we came into this first quarter with a head of steam. And the Allstate protection segment added $1.3 billion in net written premiums, $138 million in underwriting income this quarter. Allstate Health and Benefits increase adjusted net income by $35 million. We are integrating Encompass onto the National General platform and are on pace to achieve our expense synergies. We also expect to grow policies enforced by broadening that product portfolio in IA channel. And of course, that represents about a third of the total person lines market. The IA channel policies in force are approximately six times larger after this transaction, as we add standard auto and homeowners insurance products to National General's offering later this year that will drive even more growth. Let me now turn it over to Mario to go through the first quarter results in more detail. Glenn, do you want to take that? Glenn, do you want to take? Well, let me take the branding question then Glenn can fill in how we're doing the transition, because it's different for Encompass than it is for the Allstate independent agent. So first from a branding standpoint, we've decided that the Allstate brand and personal property liability will be on business that we control both the sales and the service on it. So that's both the Allstate agents and then direct whether that's a web or call center. For the independent agent business, we've rebranded National General. So it's National General and Allstate company and we launch it, I think beginning of January. So that you get the relationship with Allstate, but that everybody understands that it's separate than that, which you would get from an Allstate agent. We do not do that with the Allstate brand in the circle of protection. So for example, we sell under the Allstate name at Walmart, sell under the Allstate name at Home Depot, at target, which gives us both increased exposure to customers, enables us to further leverage that capability. And quite honestly, it's helped us dramatically expand Allstate protection products because of the power of their brand. So slightly different strategy from a branding standpoint, inside the personal property liability markets and outside, but we try to leverage it everywhere we can, but provide, make sure that that brand stands for certain things in different areas. Glenn, do you want to talk about your plans to both integrate Encompass and Allstate independent agents into National General and then Josh's question on branding at the same time. It will be at part of National General and Allstate company, correct. Whether we grow the policies to a new policy or leave the policy outstanding under the Encompass name and basically put National General stuff on top of it, it would just depend on the cost of it. And Encompass, it goes first and the Allstate independent agent, which is Allstate brand products sold through independent agents in rural spaces where it was not economic to have a captive agent, mostly there's a few places where it didn't work that way, but mostly that will transition over time as well. Let me provide an overview and then Glenn if you want to jump onto this one. So first I'm going to go up a little bit. First, it's about how do we think about increasing market share and we'll use two words together profitable growth. We put them together because that's what we want. We do not believe that growth with no profit is good for shareholders. So the objective of course is maximize shareholder value. Our expected outcomes for our team are that they will balance between growth and profitability. Our strategy of course is as Mario talked about in the first phase, second phase of transforming growth is getting more competitive auto insurance product. And we supported that, of course in worse being successful by reducing our costs. So the first thing would be we can control our costs and we can make sure that if we reduce prices to get more competitive, we still maintain our margins. Obviously, we want to be smarter whether that be how we price or how we acquire business and our marketing and we're also using telematics. And then as we go forward with transformative growth, it'll be by being faster with better technology and having new products affordable, simple and connected that are sold through that broad range of distribution that Glenn was just talking about from direct to Allstate agents. So Glenn, do you want to jump in on the specifics? Well, we're not \u2013 we don't give forecast on if growth or frequency or case tasks, these things you can't predict. Let me talk about growth a little bit, because it is really an important question that many analysts have. And of course it drives huge value in the market today. And so we were starting to have first actuals matter and we had a great quarter. I mean, over 25% revenue growth, our fifth growth was in the low teens. And we're headed towards increasing our market share pretty significantly in personal lines this year, which is consistent with our strategy. I guess what we set out to do? Now, you'd have some naysayers and say, well, you bought it with the acquisition of National General. And that's of course true. But you always have to investigate market share. In this case, it is real growth. And we look at it and said, if we had taken the net price that we paid for National General and thrown it into marketing or higher commissions or some kind of spiff. It likely would have given us less growth than we got. And certainly not the kind of profitability we're getting from it. The same thing, but we did buy it. But we did the same thing with Allstate protection plans, right? We bought SquareTrade. We repositioned it with our brands and that acquired growth and turned into an organic growth platform. We expect the same thing to happen with National General. The difference is we paid a slightly higher premium for SquareTrade than we did for National General. As it relates to the Allstate brand, we have multiple ways to grow, right. We got the Allstate agents and we're making \u2013 helping them transition to a new model. We have the direct business, which we've launched in is so by the way, at a different price than through an agent, because we believe customers should pay for what they get. And if you get an agent and get that help, you should be willing to pay for that. And so overall we feel like the Allstate brand is positioned for long-term growth as well. And so we feel like we've got an overall plan to move forward, has got transformative growth in it. It's got real growth this quarter and it's got \u2013 we're building platforms and we'll continue that growth going forward. Greg, let me start with this strategic perspective on it, and then either Maria or Glenn, if you want to talk about the first quarter. So I'm going to go back a long way. But in 2004 and 2005 we had huge catastrophe losses. We weren't earning any money on the homeowner's business. We'd make some money one year and we would lose money the next year. When you looked at over time, I think this is not a really good business. So we looked at getting out and we said what \u2013 if we were out, we'd want to be in, because it does, our customers do want it. So maybe it's just this catastrophe risk they don't want. So we created a very comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program to basically divest certain portions of the risk we took on. And that's evolved over time. We have a very sophisticated multi-year program. It's got \u2013 it's by stated got different by event. It's got the aggregate in it. And we bear that cost each and every quarter, obviously that comes through. And then sometimes it pays off. And what you saw this quarter was the aggregate kicked in. And so from losses, some of the losses, which were last year showed up as reducing our catastrophe losses this quarter, which were upgraded significantly. And that helps smooth it out. And we've looked at that from what kind of return on capital do we give up to the reinsurers and we're quite comfortable giving up the return that they get to avoid the volatility that comes from it. And so it's helped us reposition the homeowners business, so that now it's a very consistent source of profitability for us. As I was saying to the prior question, we don't believe in growth with like running homeowners above a 100 is not a good plan and you're destroying value at that point with growth. And we don't believe in that. So we've used reinsurance to help reposition the business. We did a whole bunch of other stuff including changing the product and changing the way we price and how we underwrite it, where \u2013 how we do our segmentation by down to specific risks codes. So how we pay for roofs, there's a whole bunch of stuff we've changed underneath that over the last decade. But it's a really good business. In reinsurance, using that reinsurers helped us get there. So what you saw this quarter was a benefit, which is more than was earned in this quarter, but it was paid for in the prior quarter. So if you \u2013 some people want to exclude it from this year's quarter, totally get that. Unlike that's fine. But then you should not be counting all the costs from the other time. Mario, Glenn, do you want to talk about the cost of reinsurance and the program going forward? So, overall, Greg you are right our strategy to get a more competitive in auto insurance pricing, which was Phase 2 [indiscernible] transformed to growth, included taking down costs. And as you know, we did a large reduction in force last year, did about 3,800 people starting to see that come through this year. At the same time, our advertising was way up. And so, we try to balance between those two. I don't think you could expect it to come down half a point every quarter from now till an infinite item. You should know that our strategy is to both keep reducing cost every place we can so that we can have a more affordable product for our customers and therefore a better price. So, we get more of them. But not invest in growth, because if the kind of a return on capital we're getting in these businesses, we should definitely be seeking more growth. Mario, do you want to talk more about what you \u2013 this current quarter and what the ins and outs were? Let me provide a little view and then Glenn can tell you some of the specifics of what we're doing. But Paul first thing I would say is now we're not going to do the nationwide deal and turn them all into independent agents. We don't think that makes sense from a customer standpoint. Customers come to us because they love the Allstate brand. We have a really strong brand, long relationships, so we're not planning on turning them into something else. And obviously the fast pace of change has all of this on it, whether you're a retailer or anybody what's going on in the world. And the good news for our agents is that still a majority of consumers want an insurance professional help them buy insurance. And our agents are really good at it. That said, people are more comfortable with self-service, simple items and the technology enables a computer to do some of the work that used to be handled in by people and stellar in some cases handle the local offices. So we have to transition their model and go where the customer is going. And so that includes maybe we don't have to use as much real estate as we use today. We certainly do not need to do as much service work in agent offices. So, we have a little over 10,000 Allstate agents. There's probably 26,000 to 27,000 people working in those agencies. Some of those people are doing service work. And we think we can do that either centrally at a lower cost and be more effective for our customers, or just get the computer to do it. Nobody does it at all. So, we have to figure out how do we transition those people in those offices to doing service work, to doing sales work. Or if they can't transition those licensed sales professionals, have the agents build up staff, they can move into that. So last year, one of the things that Glenn and team did was they raised new business commissions to incent, to give people the opportunity to invest more, and sell more things to more people and get more people selling for them. To offset that and continue to make sure we're meeting our customers' cost needs, we slightly reduced renewal commissions to reflect that. So, if you're an agent and you're focused on new sales, that's a good thing. You're excited about it, you are off and ready to go. If you've been focused more on service and not on growth, then you are not going to be as excited about that change because it changes your business model. So, we have to help them transition from where they are to the place where the customers want us to go, which is they want help, but they want to do it in technologically efficient, low-cost way. And we think that there's a good way to do it. Glenn can give you some examples of what we're doing with our existing agents. We've already talked about what we're doing direct to serve our customers. And then we're also trying some new models that Glenn can talk about, that do the same thing, which is use people to help people buy insurance in a local space, but at a lower cost. Glenn, do you want to give them some more specifics on that? Glenn, do I take that? Hey Glenn, do you want to take that or maybe you are on mute. And Glenn, let me just add last point which is when you see that little red bar on our graph, that was an intentional choice on our part, not a flaw in the system. So, it's not like we decided that, you know what, we were hiring these new agents, we required them to have their own office, we require that they have support staff. To make that work when you have no customers, we're paying 30% upfront commissions which then stayed high for it, not at 30%, but stayed higher than customers should have to pay for them for about five years. And we said what, but this is not the model of the future. We could have kept that going while we develop these new models. And the system would look like it would have been generating more growth than it is today. But we say, economically, that's just not the smart thing to do. Like we're not using shareholders money, right. And that's where we get into which the conversation we're talking about before is profitable growth. If you're going to [indiscernible] profitable long-term growth, and so you have some bumps, but that's not about a flaw in the system. That's about an intentional choice. David let me provide an overview and Glenn, you can take the impact of the pandemic billing stuff. First, I would say retention is really hard to do attribution on. People leave for all different reasons. And sometimes it's for price, sometimes it's because they move, sometimes it's they bought a new car. And so, it's difficult to get it down to precision to, in a point.  What you do know is if your net promoter score is good and you are doing a better job for customers, they should stay around longer. And if you are competitive in price and you are changing your price not only for new business, which we've done, but also for your existing customers, which we've done, so they have a better price and that should also keep them. But there's lots of different variations. So it's kind of really hard to predict it. Glenn, do you want to talk about how you're feeling about retention this quarter? And again, we have a hard time, nobody really knows how to predict retention. Thank you for the questions, I think, we're out of time here, it's top of the hour, and we try to be respectful of your time. Obviously, we appreciate you coming to spend time with us in here about us. We had an excellent quarter the work and you saw from that first slide, the amount of expertise and effort that went into delivering all that for the quarter. It wasn't just this quarter, it's what we do over time, but we feel good about where we're at. So, we've had great operating results as well. So, thank you for your participation. And we'll see you next quarter."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. And good morning everybody. Let's go to Slide five and delve a little deeper into Property Liability growth. Property Liability policies in force grew by 12.1%, compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 3.9 million policies. The Allstate brand grew policies by 0.5% due to growth in homeowners and other personal lines as you can see by the table on the left. Allstate brand auto insurance was flat to the prior year, as increased new business was offset by lower retention. The chart on the lower right shows a breakdown of personal auto, new issued applications compared to the prior year, which increased 64% in total, primarily due to the incremental 526,000 applications generated by National General. The middle section of the chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 5.4% increase in new business growth, compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents and a large increase in direct channel sales, more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents, as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. As a result, property liability net written premium grew 13.7% in the first quarter compared to prior year, driven by a 12.9% increase in auto insurance and a 20.3% increase in homeowners insurance. The auto insurance net written premium increase was driven by a 14.1% increase in policies in force due to National General and increased new business \u2013 new issued applications across all brands. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average auto insurance premiums from approved rate decreases and lower retention, partially driven by the impact of special payment plans that were implemented during the pandemic. If you flip to Slide 6, you see property-liability margins remain strong. The recorded combined ratio of 83.3, improved 1.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily from a lower underlying loss ratio driven by reduced auto frequency and continued cost savings. The auto insurance recorded combined ratio of 80.5, was 8.8 points below the prior year, primarily due to lower accident frequency in the quarter. Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency remained below prior year levels in 47 of 51 geographies, which includes the District of Columbia. The chart on the lower left shows the impact of the pandemic on Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency. As you can see the onset of the pandemic and efforts to slow the spread of the virus had a large impact on frequency beginning at the end of the first quarter of last year, and then extending into the second quarter when auto frequency was at its lows. This timeframe coincided with Allstate's shelter in place payback. Following the second quarter of 2020 property damage frequency has trended below pre-pandemic levels by approximately 28%, as you can see by the third and fourth quarter variances to 2019. And first quarter of 2021 frequency showed a comparable decline relative to 2019. As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure, enabling us to improve the competitive position of auto insurance, while maintaining strong returns. The property liability expense ratio improved 2.5 points in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the prior year due to the absence of coronavirus-related expenses incurred in 2020, such as the shelter in place payback as well as continued cost reductions. This was partially offset by a significant increase in advertising investment. The expense ratio, excluding coronavirus-related expenses, restructuring charges, and the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General was 22.8, an improvement of 0.5 points compared to the prior year quarter. In connection with the anticipated benefits associated with the future work environment, we expect to incur approximately $110 million in restructuring costs during 2021 with $33 million recognized in the first quarter, primarily related to real estate exit costs. These restructuring costs and their future benefits are incremental to the $290 million of aggregate restructuring costs related to transformative growth, which we announced in the third quarter of 2020 and of which we've recognized $256 million to date including $17 million this quarter. Let's move to Slide 7 to discuss our progress on building transformative growth business models. So transformative growth is a multi-year initiative to build a low cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing marketing sophistication and investment and building new technology ecosystems. A longitudinal plan segments transformative growth into five phases, starting with the conceptual design and ending with the retirement of the old business model. We've completed Phase 1 and much of Phase 2. In Phase 2, the auto insurance competitive position has been improved leading to higher close rates. This was supported by cost reductions. Direct capabilities have been expanded and sales volumes are increasing. New branding has been launched and marketing investment has been increased. This combined with industry-leading telematics capabilities will increase growth. We believe Allstate is among the leaders in telematics and is the largest pay-per-mile provider through Milewise, which offers lower costs for customers who drive less. We've also expanded independent agent distribution through the National General acquisition. Looking forward, we are now into Phase 3 in building the new operating model. We will support the transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost models. New agent models are also being tested to serve customers who want a local agent. Improving customer acquisition costs relative to lifetime value will lower costs. Expense reductions will support increased investment in growth and technology. The new customer experience and product management technology ecosystems also get deployed in this phase. Now let's go to Slide 8, which highlights investment performance for the first quarter. Net investment income totaled $708 million in the quarter, which was $462 million above the prior year quarter driven by a higher performance based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $378 million in the first quarter as shown in gray, reflecting broad based valuation increases in private equity investments and sales of underlying real estate investments. Market-based income shown in blue was $6 million below the prior year quarter with lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest bearing portfolio yield reducing income. Our first quarter GAAP total portfolio return was minus 0.2% as you can see on the bottom of the left chart, reflecting lower fixed income valuations. Over the last 12 months, the total return was 8.8%. As discussed previously, our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon with higher, but more volatile return expectations. This volatility can be seen by the chart on the lower right. It highlights the one, five and 10-year performance-based internal rates of return. The one year trends has been volatile throughout the pandemic with the two most recent quarters, significantly higher than the returns experienced during the middle of 2020. Conversely, the five and 10-year trends are stable and closer to our expected returns. Moving to Slide 9. Allstate Protection Plans continues to grow revenue and profit. As you recall, we purchased Allstate Protection Plans for $1.4 billion in 2017 to broaden the protection solutions offered to customers. It provides low cost protection with excellent service. Products are primarily sold for U.S. retailers and leverage the Allstate brand. Since acquisition, Allstate Protection Plans has experienced rapid top-line growth and improved profitability. Revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 48% over the last three years, as you can see on the bottom left. And we're more than $1 billion over the latest 12 months. Adjusted net income went from a loss of $22 million in 2017 to income of $148 million over the last 12 months. Additional growth will be achieved by further expanding appliance furniture and mobile phone protection, expanding the geographic footprint outside the U.S. and creating new innovative services such as two-day appliance repair. This acquisition has been an incredible success for us. Now let's move to Slide 10, which highlights Allstate attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.2% for the last 12 months, which was 5.7 points higher than the prior year. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth. We provided significant cash returns to shareholders in the first quarter through a combination of $601 million in share repurchases and $164 million in common stock dividends. The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Given our growth strategy and sustainable earnings potential, we announced a 50% increase in the quarterly common shareholder dividend to $0.81 paid to shareholders on April 1. The total cash return provided to shareholders was 7.8% of average market capitalization over the last 12 months. With that context, let's open up the line for questions. Sure. I can jump in on that Tom. And just to give you a little color, Greg, on the benefits in the quarter. We recovered about $955 million in the quarter on a net basis. Part of that was from our per occurrence nationwide program where we retain the first $500 million of an event. And then we have coverage up \u2013 in our current program up to $5 billion. And then as Tom mentioned, we also have an aggregate cover, which is about $1 billion, which spans a 12-month period. We also had recoveries under that. So combined, it was about $955 million. That's net of reinstatement premiums in the quarter, and it was principally on the freeze event in Texas. So the freeze event on a net basis cost us $586 million in the quarter. Once you start peeling back the prior year component of that reinsurance recovery, which was about $150 million. You get to a gross loss in Texas north of $1.3 billion. So we've benefited pretty significantly in the quarter from our reinsurance program. As you mentioned, we posted on our website \u2013 we placed most of the nationwide program this quarter and we still have a component of the nationwide program to do. And then remember we have a separate Florida program. The costs year-over-year, because we've included National General in this year's program. It's going to be slightly higher than it was a year ago when you add up what we were spending on reinsurance and what National General was spending on reinsurance. But in terms of what you saw in the first quarter, you got to remember, that's still last year's program that was placed May 1. And what we saw last year was the increase we experienced was mainly in the Florida program. And you're seeing that kind of cycle through in the first quarter. We will start incurring the cost of this year's program when it incepts which is on June 1. Yes. Thanks Craig. So, I guess, it's not mentioned. We're going to continue to focus on reducing our cost structure. And like we said, really all along, our focus on reducing our cost structure is not a margin expansion focus, it's a growth focus. And it's a growth focus because reducing our costs enables us to invest more in growth. And you saw it this quarter where we invested more in marketing and the component of our underwriting expense ratio related to marketing actually increased by nine tenths of a point. Yet it was more than offset by the operating cost reductions that Tom referenced from last year. So, real ins and outs were more investment in advertising, more than offset by cost reductions and net-net a half a point improvement in kind of the underlying expense ratio in the quarter. And we're going to continue to focus on moving that number down. The other thing I'd mentioned on expenses, and it's not obvious in our numbers is, part of our focus on cost reduction has been on getting more efficient in claim handling. And we've improved the efficiency in our loss adjustment expense, which comes through the loss ratio. But again, we consider it as a core part of our cost reduction efforts to improve the combine \u2013 improve the cost structure, creates a path we need to invest and be able to grow more and continue to deliver excellent return. So, I think what you saw in the quarter was really kind of proof of, of how that strategy is playing out. In terms of the homeowner expense ratio specifically, Greg, I'd have to go back and take a look at what components of it \u2013 whether it came through distribution costs, or underwriting costs, whether it was like inspections, and so on. So let me take that one offline and I'll get back to you on that one. Glenn, you can take where we are with Milewise, and number of states and how [indiscernible] you got the done pricing. I would say though, when you just step all the way back, we're about building a digital insurer. And sometimes that gets lost into how big and how successful we are given the size and scale of our company. [Indiscernible] sometimes people look at people who only do that and assume that, they are about to take over the market. We're happy to compete. We feel like we're really doing well in here. We're early in telematics. We think we're a leader in telematics. And this is an example of a product where we were out early, we're aggressively advertising it and it's resonating. Glenn, do you want to talk about, what you've done to help it grow?"

After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, please be aware that this call is being recorded. And now I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2021 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time in Allstate today. I\u2019ll start by setting context and then Mario and Jess would provide additional perspective on operating results and the actions being taken to improve auto profitability and increase shareholder value. So let\u2019s begin on Slide 2. So as you know, Allstate strategy has two components: increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand Protection Services, which is shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right hand side, you can see our results for the year. Earnings were disappointing with a net loss of $1.4 billion, largely reflecting an underwriting loss on auto insurance and mark-to-market losses on the equity portfolio. Strong results from homeowners insurance, protection services and fixed income investments were not enough to offset the losses on auto and commercial insurance. The most important driver of near-term shareholder value will be successfully executing our comprehensive plan to improve auto profitability. That includes broadly raising auto insurance rates, reducing expenses including temporary moves such as less advertising and permanent reductions including digitizing and outsourcing work and lowering distribution costs. Underwriting restrictions have been implemented to reduce new business volume until profitability is acceptable. Claims operating processes are also being modified to manage our loss costs. This plan is being implemented, but earned premiums from auto insurance rates have not increased enough to offset higher loss costs. And while the number one priority is to improve auto insurance margins, implementation of the transformative growth strategies make great progress in 2022, and we validated that this will drive personal Property-Liability market share growth. Proactive investment risk and return management mitigated approximately $2 billion of loss this year. And while the total return on the portfolio was a negative 4%, that compares very favorably to the performance of the S&P 500 and intermediate bond indices. We also had another great year at Allstate Protection Plans. Moving to Slide 3, let\u2019s discuss financial results. Starting at the top, revenues of $13.6 billion in the fourth quarter were 4.9% higher than the prior year quarter, increasing the full year total to $51.4 billion. Property-Liability premiums earned increased by 9.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 8.5% for the full year due to higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance. Moving down the table, an adjusted net loss of $359 million was incurred in the fourth quarter reflecting an auto insurance underwriting loss, which is impacted by reserve increases for the current and prior years. Now let me turn it over to Mario to discuss our Property-Liability results and then Jess will cover the other components of earnings.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s start by reviewing underwriting profitability for the Property-Liability business in total on Slide 4. The overall message is that the underwriting loss was a result of auto insurance operating at a combined ratio above our targets, but homeowners insurance continued to be a strong source of profit. On the left chart, the recorded combined ratio of 109.1 in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by higher auto loss costs, unfavorable reserve development and higher catastrophes. This led to a full year recorded combined ratio of 106.6, which was 10.7 points higher than the prior year. The table on the right shows the combined ratio and underwriting income by line of business for the quarter and the year. Auto insurance had a combined ratio of 112.6 in the quarter and 110.1 for the year, substantially worse than our targets given rapidly increasing loss costs throughout the year. This result was an underwriting loss of $974 million in the quarter and over $3 billion for the year. Hence, you can see why Tom has said executing our auto profit improvement plan is the number one priority going forward. Homeowners insurance, on the other hand, had excellent results with the combined \u2013 with combined ratios in the low 90s, which generated $681 million of underwriting income for the year. This reflects industry-leading underwriting and risk management in this line of business. Commercial insurance was negatively impacted by the same auto insurance cost pressures, along with inadequate pricing for the coverage provided to the large transportation network companies. The result was an underwriting loss for the year of $464 million. This led to the decision discussed last quarter to not provide insurance to transportation network companies unless telematics-based pricing is implemented and to exit five states in the Allstate traditional commercial business. These actions are expected to reduce commercial business premiums by over 50% in 2023. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 5 and discuss auto margin in more detail. As you can see from the chart on the left, which shows the auto insurance combined ratio and underlying combined ratio from 2017 through the current year, we have a long history of sustained profitability in auto insurance due to pricing sophistication, underwriting and claims expertise and expense management. In 2020, the combined ratio dropped to 86 even though we provided customers with over $1 billion of shelter-in-place payments. This was due to historically low accident frequency in the early stages of the pandemic. In 2021, frequency increased as mileage driven increased, but it did not reach pre-pandemic levels. Claims severity, however, increased above historical levels because of more severe increasing costs to settle claims with third parties, who are injured in accidents with our customers. In addition, used car prices were increasing at unprecedented levels, eventually peaking in December, reflecting an approximate 50% increase over the prior year. We had a reported combined ratio of 95 for the year despite all these pressures. This year, the combined ratio increased 14.7 points to 110.1, the drivers of which are shown in the right-hand chart. The red bars reflect the impact of increasing loss costs, including a 3.6 point impact from prior year reserve additions and a 16.7 point impact from current year underlying losses, excluding catastrophes, which include increases in both frequency and more significantly, severity compared to last year. As we discussed, the core component of the profit improvement plan is to raise auto insurance rates and substantial progress was made on this front starting in the fourth quarter of 2021 and throughout last year. In 2022, the impact of higher average earned premium drove a benefit of 3.6 points, which is shown in green. As I will cover in a minute, there is much more benefit to be realized in earned premiums based on what was implemented in 2022. Another part of the profit improvement plan is to reduce expenses and this contributed a favorable 2 point benefit this year. Moving to Slide 6. Let\u2019s discuss prior year reserve re-estimates before we look forward. Our loss estimates and reserve liabilities use consistent practices, multiple analytical methods and two external actuarial reviews to ensure reserve adequacy. These processes led us to increase the reserve liability for prior years throughout 2022 by amounts that are larger than recent years. Property-Liability prior year reserve strengthening, excluding catastrophes totaled $1.7 billion or 3.9 points on the combined ratio for the full year 2022. The pie chart on the left breaks down the impact by line and coverage with $1.1 billion driven by Allstate Brand personal auto largely related to bodily injury claims. In addition $295 million was related to Allstate Brand commercial insurance, also mostly related to auto. The table on the right breaks down the Allstate Brand auto prior year reserve strengthening of $1.1 billion in 2022 by report year. Let me orient you to the table. Reserve increases are shown by coverage in total and then for the report here to which they apply. The reserve liability for physical damage coverages was increased by $211 million, which was entirely attributable to 2021. This primarily related to adverse development and elongated repair time frames, which were primarily addressed in the first and second quarter. Injury reserves were the largest component at $676 million, which was spread across many report years. Incurred but not reported was increased by $226 million as late reported claim counts have exceeded prior estimates. This reserve balance was increased in each of the first three quarters of 2022, but a larger amount was recorded in the fourth quarter. In total for all coverages about 63% of the increases were for 2021 and 2020. At the bottom of the table, the reported combined ratio for the calendar year is shown and compared to the reserve changes. For example in 2021, the reported combined ratios for Allstate Brand auto insurance was 95. The reserve additions indicate that costs were 2.1 points above this reported number. Estimating reserve liability utilizes multiple reserving techniques, but is always subject to strengthening or releasing reserves over time. This variability increases with changes in the underlying data, such as claim counts, settlement times, or cost increases and as has been the case over the past three years. While reserves could change going forward, based on the 2022 claim statistics and data, reserves are appropriately established at year-end 2022. Moving to Slide 7. Let\u2019s provide some clarity on what the auto insurance combined ratio trend was by quarter in 2022. As you can see on the left-hand chart, the recorded combined ratio peaked in the third quarter at 117.4, largely reflecting prior year reserve changes and catastrophe losses shown in light blue. The dark blue bars are the underlying combined ratio, as reported, which increased each quarter. Included in this dark blue bar is the impact of increasing claim severities within the year. We update the forecast on claim severities as the year progresses. As 2022 developed, loss cost trends resulted in increases to current report year ultimate severity expectations. As shown in the call out on the left chart, 2022 incurred severities for collision, property damage and bodily injury was 17%, 21% and 14%, respectively, above the full report year 2021 level. This estimate, however, increased throughout the year. The impact of increasing current report year on incurred severities as the year progressed influences the quarter underlying combined ratio trend. This impact from increasing full year severities from claims occurring in prior quarters is reflected in the financial results of the period where severities were increased. For example, the fourth quarter of 2022 reflects the impact of higher severity expectations in the auto physical damage coverage, not just for claims reported in Q4 but also for claims that were reported throughout the prior three quarters as well. The chart on the right adjusts the quarterly underlying combined ratio to reflect full year average severity levels, which removes the influence of intra-year severity changes. As you can see, after adjusting for the timing of severity increases in the current year, the quarterly underlying combined ratio trend was essentially flat throughout 2022 and close to the full year level of 103.6. Slide 8 outlines our comprehensive approach to restore auto margins. There are four areas of focus: raising rates; a continued focus on reducing expenses; implementing stricter underwriting requirements; and modifying claim practices to manage loss costs. Starting with rates, since the beginning of this year, we\u2019ve implemented rate increases of 16.9% in the Allstate Brand, including 6.1% in the fourth quarter, which significantly increased written premium. We expect to continue to pursue significant rate increases into 2023 to improve auto insurance margins to target levels. We are also reducing operating expenses as part of transformative growth and have temporarily reduced advertising spend to manage new business volume. We are implementing more restrictive underwriting actions on new business in locations or risk segments where we cannot achieve adequate prices for the risk. Increased restrictions have been implemented in 37 states including California, New York and New Jersey, which account for a large portion of underwriting losses. Claim practices have been modified to deal with the higher loss cost environment. For example, we have strategic partnerships with part suppliers and repair facilities to mitigate the cost of repair and use predictive modeling to optimize repair versus total loss decisions and likelihood of injury and attorney representation. Moving to Slide 9, let\u2019s discuss a key component of our multifaceted plan raising auto insurance prices. Growth in average premium per policy is accelerating due to implemented rate increases, but the impact to average earned premium per policy is on a lag due to the six-month policy term. The chart on the left depicts the year-over-year growth in auto average gross written premium in orange, reaching 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The auto average earned premium growth of 9.7% in the fourth quarter, represented in blue, continues to increase, but on a lag due to the six-month policy term. The chart on the right is an estimation of when the rate increase is implemented will be earned into premiums. Of course, actual earned premium growth will be influenced by changes in the number of policies in force and absolute levels of new business and retention. This illustrative example assumes 85% of the annualized written premium will be earned since customers modify policy terms such as deductibles or limits where they may not renew. Starting on the left, over the last 15 months, we\u2019ve implemented Allstate brand auto rate increases of 19.8% for an estimated annualized written premium impact of approximately $4.8 billion. Using the historical 85% effectiveness assumption nets a total of $4.1 billion in expected earned premium, represented by the second blue bar. Approximately $1.2 billion has been earned through the fourth quarter. Of the remaining $2.9 billion of premium yet to be earned, roughly $2.6 billion will be earned in 2023 and $300 million in 2024 as shown in green. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to implement additional rate increases in 2023, which will be additive to the figures shown on this chart. Slide 10 illustrates the drivers that will determine the timing of improved auto profitability. The chart on this page is an illustrative view we\u2019ve shown in the past on our path to target profitability along with the magnitude of actions already taken and required prospectively. Starting on the left, the first blue bar shows the year-end 2022 auto insurance reported combined ratio 110.1. To start with the normalized base, we removed the impact of prior year reserve increases and normalized the catastrophe loss ratio for our five-year historical average. This improves the combined ratio by roughly 4.5 points. The second green bar reflects the estimated impact of rate actions already implemented when fully earned into premium, which we discussed on the prior slide. The impact on the combined ratio is approximately 10.5 points when combining the Allstate brand and the National General brand actions. Those two adjustments would improve the combined ratio to target levels. Now of course, we know that loss costs will increase, whether from severity or accident frequency, which would increase the combined ratio. So prospective rate increases and other margin improvement actions must meet or exceed loss cost increases to achieve historical returns. We continue to manage the auto insurance business with the expectation to achieve an auto insurance combined ratio target in the mid-90s. Moving to Slide 11, the table shows Allstate brand auto results in three major states: California, New York and New Jersey combined contributed approximately a quarter of the Allstate brand auto written premiums in 2022 but accounted for approximately 45% of the underwriting loss. While rates were increased in 2022 by 7% to 10%, this is not enough to achieve target margins. As a result, we have more work to do, some of which is listed on the right-hand side. The right-hand side of the slide is a list of actions we are taking in each of these states to improve margins. In California, we filed for an additional 6.9% rate increase in January after getting approval for an initial 6.9% rate increase and are significantly increasing down payment requirements. In New York, while multiple rate filings were requested, only partial approval of the increases requires us to make additional rate filings in early 2023, increased down payment requirements, allowable prior incidents and channel restrictions means fewer choices for consumers until an adequate rate is approved. In New Jersey, additional rate filings will also be made and similar underwriting actions will be implemented as those taken in New York. Moving to Slide 12. Let\u2019s look at a continued good performance story in homeowners insurance. As you know a significant portion of our customers bundle home and auto insurance, which improves retention and the overall economics of both product lines. We have a differentiated homeowners product, underwriting, reinsurance and claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. Net written premium has increased significantly throughout 2021 and into 2022, increasing 9.3% from the prior year quarter and 12% for the full year, predominantly driven by higher average gross written premium per policy and a 1.4% increase in policies in force. National general written premiums also increased as we improved underwriting margins closer to targeted levels. The fourth quarter combined ratio for homeowners of 92.6 increased by 5.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, while full year combined ratio of 93.8 and declined by 3 points compared to 2021. For the year, this line generated $681 million of underwriting income. The increase in the fourth quarter is shown on the right side. The increased combined ratio was driven by elevated catastrophe losses, primarily due to winter storm Elliot. Homeowners insurance was also impacted by the higher loss cost environment as we continue to experience higher severities due to increasing labor and material costs. To address the inflationary environment, our products have sophisticated pricing features that respond to changes in home replacement values. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results.\nJess Merten: All right. Thank you, Mario. Well, property liability is a core business for us. There are other important drivers of financial performance to discuss, starting with investment income on Slide 13. As shown in the table at the bottom left, the total return of our portfolio is 2.5% in the fourth quarter and negative 4% for the year. These returns for our broadly diversified portfolio compare favorably to the full year performance for the S&P 500 of negative 18%, and to the Bloomberg Intermediate Bond Index return of negative 9%. Net investment income shown in the chart on the left totaled $557 million in the quarter, which is $290 million below fourth quarter last year. Market-based income of $464 million, which is shown in blue, was $101 million above the prior year quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter of increase as we benefit from reinvestment at higher market yields. Performance-based income of $147 million shown in black was $369 million below a strong prior year quarter. Income this quarter included in negative contribution from valuation of private equity fund investments that was more than offset by positive contributions from direct investments along with positive returns for infrastructure in real estate. The chart on the right shows the fixed income yield is rising and was 3.2% at quarter end, but is still below the current intermediate corporate bond yield at 5.3%. Also shown is that duration increased modestly to 3.4 in the fourth quarter, primarily by removing approximately half of our duration shortening interest rate derivatives. The migration of the portfolio to higher yield and the corresponding increase in income will happen over time as we reinvest portfolio cash flows into higher interest rates. With the portfolio in unrealized loss positions accelerating this shift by selling bonds to generate capital losses but will be pursued if it optimizes enterprise risk and return. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 14 and talk more about how enterprise risk and return management impacts investment allocations and results. Proactive investment management is highly integrated with risk adjusted return opportunities across the enterprise. We discussed this in detail on our September 1 Special Topic call on investments. In 2021, we decided to lower overall risk levels given the declines in auto insurance profitability. We also expected that sustained inflation would lead to higher interest rates. As a result, the economic capital deployed to investments was reduced. This led to a shortening of the bond portfolio through the sale of long corporate and municipal bonds and the use of derivatives. While adverse market conditions negatively impacted our portfolio, these actions mitigated losses by approximately $2 billion. In 2022, giving continued auto insurance losses, we decided to lower the potential for investment losses as the U.S. economy went into recession. At the same time, interest rates were increasing, offering a better risk adjusted return from fixed income. Consequently, holdings and below investment grade bonds were cut almost in half, and public equity holdings were lowered by 40%. Late in the year, interest rates had increased in the duration of the bond portfolio was extended as shown on the previous slide. About half the duration shortening derivative position was removed in the fourth quarter, at the same time, this lowered the amount of economic capital deployed to investments. These actions optimize enterprise risk and return and provide flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities as economic conditions evolve. The Protection Services businesses also create shareholder value, as shown on Slide 15. Revenues, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, increased 6.1% to $643 million in the quarter and 8.7% to $2.5 billion for the full year 2022. The increase in revenue for the fourth quarter and full year was primarily driven by Allstate Protection Plans growth of 16.9% and 15.7% respectively. As you can see from the table on the right, Allstate Protection Plans continues to rapidly expand with written premium of $1.9 billion for the year. Allstate Protection Plans expansion in 2022 is primarily driven by our investment in appliance and furniture product coverages. We continue to believe there\u2019s a significant growth opportunity in these areas and in our continued expansion of European consumer electronics and other international growth. Given, the longer policy term compared to auto and homeowner\u2019s insurance products, the unearned premium balance continues to significantly grow as well, reaching $2.6 billion at the end of the year. For the segment, adjusted net income of $38 million in the quarter, increased $9 million compared to the prior year due to a one-time net tax benefit in Allstate Protection Plans. Full year adjusted net income of $169 million, decreased $10 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the lower revenue in Arity as a result of decreased insurer client advertising. We\u2019ll continue to invest in growing these businesses as they provide an attractive opportunity to meet customers\u2019 needs and create economic value for our shareholders. Moving on to Slide 16, Allstate Health and Benefits is growing an attractive set of businesses that protects more than 4 million policy holders. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual products to our portfolio as you can see on the left. Revenues of $579 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, decreased 1.5% to the prior year quarter as a reduction in individual health was partially offset by an increase in group health and other revenue. Adjusted net income of $50 million, increased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter, resulting in a full year 2022 income of $222 million. The full year 2022 result was $14 million above prior year and reflects increases in group health revenues partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses on group health contract benefits. Let\u2019s close by highlighting Allstate\u2019s strong financial condition and proactive approach to capital management, which you can see on Slide 17. We ended the year with $4 billion in holding company assets, which represents an increase of $700 million compared to year end 2021. We believe holding company assets and capital resources available from statutory operating companies provide financial flexibility as we continue to implement profit proven actions, invest in Transformative Growth and return capital to shareholders. As you can see, our adjusted net loss in 2022 resulted in a negative adjusted net income return on equity. Executing our comprehensive plan in achieving target combined ratios for auto and homeowners insurance will bring adjusted net income returns and equity back to our long-term target range of 14% to 17%. In 2022, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through $2.5 billion in share repurchases and $926 million in common shareholder dividends. This resulted in common shares outstanding being reduced by 6.1%, reflecting the repurchase of 19.7 million shares in 2022. With that as context, let\u2019s open the line for your questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your question, please.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. I wanted to ask about claims management process that over the course of the last couple of years, I think of Allstate is having a superior claims management in auto and home and that is being kind of one of the core advantages. But you\u2019ve also been implementing a lot of cost cuts and laying off folks over the last couple years. So how are you sort of balancing that? And are there some core metrics that we can see as outsiders that suggest that advantage relative to your peers still exists?\nTom Wilson: Thank you, Paul. Good morning. Let me make a few overview comments and then Mario can jump in. You\u2019re correct that one of our competitive advantages really claim [indiscernible] settling what are millions of claims a year. And we really look at like a \u2013 it\u2019s a systems approach. It\u2019s not the result of adding one person process or vendor arrangement. But like for example, if you look at auto insurance, we have this network of auto body repair facilities enables us to both source high quality costs, high quality repairs, good costs and in timely stuff. So cutting down things like car, rental use and stuff like that. At the same time, we have extensive use of analytics, whether that\u2019s the value of an individual car in a local market with specific options to settlements of complicated multi-year bodily injury claims or fraud detection. Part sourcing and buying that Mario talked about enables us to both control the price of those parts by buying them in bulk. But also deciding which part you use. You use an OE [ph] part or an aftermarket part, what\u2019s available in the local market. So the reason I\u2019m going through that is it\u2019s a really complicated system that works really well. We\u2019ve got good employee training, got good technology, we have good quality control processes. And we do have metrics that you can look at to determine how we\u2019re doing versus the outside. There\u2019s first call reporting and there\u2019s some other external reporting which shows, for example, that we have. We buy \u2013 we pay less per claim for parts and labor than other people. So some of that information like first call you guys could have access to others \u2013 we get from other sources. But it \u2013 what it tells us is that we\u2019re good. Now, anytime you\u2019re good, the only reason \u2013 the only way you stay good is you keep changing and getting better and updating processes. And so as we\u2019ve dealt with these dramatic swings and frequency and costs, we continue to implement changes to improve the effectiveness and efficiency and Mario can talk about those. Are we perfect? No. Are we constantly reassessing everything we do to make sure we\u2019re getting the right price for parts and we\u2019re settling at the right value for customers of course. Do we believe it\u2019s still a continued competitive advantage for Allstate? Yes. So Mario, would you want to talk about some of the things you worked on last year and what you have looking forward this year?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, thanks Tom, and thanks for the question, Paul. First thing, I would reiterate what Tom said. We continue to view our claims capabilities as a competitive differentiator and a source of real value for Allstate. We think that\u2019s been \u2013 certainly been true in the past and it\u2019ll continue to be true going forward. The reality is given the environment we\u2019re operating in, both from a casualty perspective as well as physical damage, we\u2019ve talked a lot throughout the year around the drivers of inflation and the things that are driving up loss costs at such a rapid pace. And I think what that does is it really forces us and the industry to continue to evolve those practices. And it\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve done overtime to continue to maintain in our leadership position and our edge when it comes to claims. So let me just spend a minute and I\u2019ll break out casualty versus physical damage. In terms of the action plans, we talk a lot about changing operational processes. I\u2019ll say a couple things starting with casualty first. One of the things we\u2019ve done over the past 12 plus months is we\u2019ve meaningfully reduced the volume of pending bodily injury claims by about 20%. And what that does is it reduces risk of both of inflation impacting those claims that certainly that we\u2019ve settled and remediated going forward. But also reduces we think reserve uncertainty on those claims going forward. And to just give you a sense of context, the current level of bodily injury pending claims in aggregate is at its lowest level that it\u2019s been since before 2016. So we\u2019ve looked to de-risk the bodily injury pending portfolio by leaning in and settling claims. We\u2019re also focusing on a strategy that I would characterize as an earlier strategy when it comes to bodily injury. Things like earlier recognition of injury claims, earlier claimant contact and earlier settlement of claims that we should settle quickly again to avoid the inflationary risk in the current environment. And what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re leveraging our advanced data and analytics capabilities to execute on all components of that strategy to continue to evolve and get better in casualty claim handling. On the physical damage side, I think it\u2019s really around, broadly continuing to focus on estimation accuracy cycle time and leveraging \u2013 further leveraging our scale to the fullest extent. It\u2019s continuing to increase the utilization of our good hands repair network to reduce costs, both in terms of parts and labor costs and improve cycle time while continuing to improve or provide a high quality customer experience. Enhancing total loss processes to reduce cycle time and reduce costs around things like storage and rental costs and identification of preexisting damage on vehicles, again, to move total losses through the system more rapidly. And then continuing to look to leverage our scale additionally when it comes to sourcing parts and getting as efficient as we can from a process perspective. So we\u2019re really attacking claims across a number of fronts. Again, feel really good about where we\u2019re positioned with claims. And this is all about continuing to get better and maintain that industry leading capability on the claim side.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment\u2026\nPaul Newsome: Is there any difference in how you handle claims across the distribution systems at this point that would vary the execution of claims?\nMario Rizzo: This is Mario. Yes, sure. I\u2019ll jump in. Process wise, we adopt consistent processes across claims. There\u2019s certainly unique processes. For example, in National General, given the non-standard auto mix, there\u2019s just a different approach to those claims because they potentially have a higher risk of fraud. So there\u2019s some unique processes there. But in terms of claim handling consistency for similar types of claims, we tend to leverage best practices across brands.\nPaul Newsome: Great. Thank you for your help as always. Really appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of C. Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question please.\nC. Gregory Peters: Good morning everyone. Tough quarter and a tough year for the company. I was looking at Slide 11 in the supplement. And this is the slide that talks about the Allstate brand auto state profitability. And if we look at the number of states that have a combined ratio above 100, it steadily increased through the fourth quarter and it kind of a contrary to the comments you made about the rate that you applied and achieved in the year. So my question is what type of expectation do you have for that category of states above 100 as we move through 2023? Is it kind of peak here at 41? Do you think it could get worse? Or what\u2019s your expectation going forward of how that might trend?\nTom Wilson: Greg, let me provide an overview, then Mario can jump in on it. First, as we said and you know well that improving auto profitability will be a key to driving shareholder value. So we\u2019re all over that. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress. Mario showed about the rate increases. And so of the $4.1 billion that we think will still come true, or that will come through from the rate increases we\u2019ve already implemented, we\u2019ve got $1.2 billion, $2.6 billion of that should show up in 2023. And I would point out that, that\u2019s not in those combined ratio numbers. So our objective is to make money in every line in every state. So no cross subsidies between states, no cross-subsidies between lines. Now, of course, that\u2019s hard to do with as many lines as many states we\u2019re in, but that\u2019s our objective. And so the amount \u2013 that amount that\u2019s not reflected in the \u2013 some of those states. We think some of those states are probably adequately priced today. There are many that are not, and so we\u2019ll continue to drive those. But I would expect to see that number come down. But we don\u2019t have a target of \u2013 we\u2019re at 41 at the end of the year. We want to be at some XX at the end of the first quarter. It\u2019s every state, every line, make money every year. Mario, would you want to add some additional color to that?\nMario Rizzo: Sure. And thanks for the question, Greg. Look, I think when you look at that trend of states above 100 and the increase throughout the year, I think what I\u2019d point you to is when you just \u2013 you look at our underlying auto combined ratio as we reported it, increasing throughout the year and being driven by increases in our severity expectations quarter-over-quarter as the year played out, as well as increasing frequency between Q1 through Q4, only partially being offset by the rate that we took. So I think that chart mirrors what we show you in aggregate in terms of the reported underlying combined ratio. But when you look at our business from a state perspective, I think it\u2019s important to really categorize states into a couple of different buckets. I think there\u2019s a group of states that while we certainly are pleased with the outcome of an underwriting loss, given the actions we\u2019ve taken, particularly from a rate perspective as well as underwriting actions, we feel like we\u2019re positioned in a good place. Now you can\u2019t predict the future in terms of the path of inflation or severity going forward. But given the actions we\u2019ve taken, we feel good about where we\u2019re positioned and what the outlook looks like for 2023. I put states like Texas, Georgia, a couple of large states for us where we\u2019ve implemented significant rates and have been successful in doing so. And so we feel good about the outlook. Again, we\u2019ll have to adapt to what changes in the future, but I think there is a lot of states that falls into that category. Unfortunately, there is a number of, for us, pretty meaningful states, three of which we highlighted in the presentation: California, New York, New Jersey, where they\u2019re much more challenging regulatory environments. And we need to continue to execute on both rate increases and underwriting restrictions to curb growth to really bend the line in aggregate. And just using California as one example. So as you all know, we got a 6.9% rate approved late in the year, but we immediately filed another 6.9% increase pending with the department. We took down paid requirements up pretty dramatically. We have not changed those down paid requirements even with the first rate. We\u2019re working with the department on getting approval for the second 6.9%. But then we\u2019re going to come back with another rate increase because we need more rate in California. So that\u2019s a big state for us where we\u2019re going to have to continue to really lean in and take \u2013 continue to take dramatic and aggressive actions to improve margins. And I put New York in that same category. We got a 5% flex rate in New York. Middle of the year, we got approval for a 9.4% rate in New York towards the end of the year, while we\u2019re prepared to do additional \u2013 an additional round of rate filings in New York early in 2023, because loss trends are not where they need to be. And in the interim, we\u2019ve taken underwriting actions around prior incidents, down pay and other actions to curb new business growth, and we\u2019re going to continue to lean into those actions because we can\u2019t afford to write the new business at the current rate levels and we\u2019ll continue to take the appropriate actions there. So I think you got to look at the states in a different way. I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in a number of states, but we still have some work to do. And as we said, we expect to take some pretty significant rate increases in 2023, particularly leaning into some of those states where we haven\u2019t, really for regulatory reasons been able to make the kind of progress that we would have liked.\nC. Gregory Peters: That\u2019s good detail. Just the follow-up question on those three states, California, New York and New Jersey. And I know you\u2019re not going to start negotiating with the Departments of Insurance on an earnings conference call. But when I look at California, for example, you yourself said 6.9% is not going to be enough. One of your competitors recently got, just last month got a rate increase improved that was in the teens. Why not pivot and get more aggressive with rate filings in some of these challenging states? It seems like some of your peers might be doing that and getting \u2013 having some success.\nTom Wilson: Greg, I would just maybe provide \u2013 I think we\u2019ve been very aggressive when you look at how much we\u2019ve raised rates in total for the year across the country. We\u2019ve been very aggressive. And depending whose measures you want to use, more aggressive. As you never really know where people start and what they finish and what their losses are. Mario, do you want to talk specifically about California?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Sure. So, Greg, I think we\u2019ve been working really closely with the Department of Insurance in California. We were able to pretty rapidly get approval of our first 6.9%, and we\u2019re in active dialogue around the second 6.9%. And as I mentioned, when we get that one behind us, there\u2019ll be a third one coming. We always have the option of going down the path of filing a larger rate increase. California generally takes a longer time period to get approvals for rates as it is. And the one you mentioned specifically, I think, have been pending with the department for over a year. So we\u2019re \u2013 as we look at the map, we want to get approval, we want to get approval as rapidly as we can, so we can implement the rates and move on. So the approach we\u2019ve taken so far in California, we\u2019re comfortable with. We\u2019re going to continue to lean in. We always have the option to change course if things change. But so far, we\u2019ve had success with the path we\u2019ve taken, and we\u2019re going to continue to push on that.\nC. Gregory Peters: Thank you for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you, one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on capital, right? You guys said you expect to complete the buyback program by the \u2013 still by the end of the third quarter of 2023. Can you just help us understand what metrics you\u2019re looking at to judge the capital adequacy of Allstate Insurance Company at the end of 2022? I think in the past, you\u2019ve said you look at RBC ratios there. Can you give us a sense of where you ended 2022 your RBC was, and where you would like that to be over time?\nTom Wilson: Elyse, I\u2019ll let Jess give you some specifics, but we obviously have a long history of managing capital that both balances our financial strength, growth returns to shareholders. We have plenty of capital to grow our business and pursue attractive risk and return opportunities. We do it in a much more sophisticated way than RBC. So for example, when Jess talked about the things we had done in the investment portfolio, that we allocate specific amounts of capital to different investment allocations. So when we dial up interest rate risk, we put a little more capital up for it. If we dial down equities, we put up less capital, and we believe we\u2019re really well capitalized and don\u2019t have any issues. Jess, do you want to go from there?\nJess Merten: Yes. Thanks, Tom. So Elyse, I think as it relates to your question on RBC, we haven\u2019t disclosed the RBC for the year. That will come out in due course as it relates to the actual RBC in insurance company, and we don\u2019t publish a target. I think Tom hit on the right point, because you asked what are the metrics that we look at as we think about the repurchases. And we really do focus on our sophisticated economic capital model that looks at a comprehensive view of risk across types around the enterprise. And we use that as the basis for capital management. We obviously focus on RBC rating agency metrics, a variety of other things. But we don\u2019t have specific targets that we published as it relates to risk-based capital. So \u2013 and I really like to take it up a level and just think about how we manage it overall using our sophisticated, risk-based capital framework. We remain confident in our overall capital position and the capital position of the insurance subsidiaries.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question is going back to some of what you guys have been discussing with modifying your claims practices. Have you guys tested the predictive modeling on an external data against your own internal data and seeing a meaningful benefit? And should we \u2013 how \u2013 over what time period should we think about the rollout of the program over the next year, 12 months to 24 months, on what type of time frame should we be thinking about?\nTom Wilson: Elyse, I\u2019m not sure which predictive models are you talking about the \u2013 I mean we use predictive models for a lot in claims. Was there one specifically you were interested in?\nElyse Greenspan: Well, I was talking about some of the kind of changes you guys have stressed that you\u2019re kind of looking to make on the claims side of things.\nTom Wilson: Okay. Yes. Let me \u2013 I\u2019ll take a shot at it and Mario, you can jump in. So we use \u2013 I mean we\u2019re a data-driven company, so we use predictive models as you know well, for just about everything. That could be fraud. There could be \u2013 do we think this claim might end up being severe enough where it gets represented by a lawyer? So it\u2019s important for us to establish a relationship with the customers as possible. It might be, do we think there\u2019s a better way to settle this claim, whether it gets \u2013 the car gets totaled or we send it to a body shop. So there\u2019s we use predictive analytics throughout the business and obviously largely in claims as well. So we\u2019re always tuning those. We think we\u2019re pretty good at it. You can\u2019t really take one specific algorithm. But when you look at our claims severities, you can look at them externally. And when you look at absolute dollars, we think we did really well. It\u2019s easier on physical damage, obviously, because you\u2019re just fixing a car bodily injury, it\u2019s like, okay, well, what was the case worth? What\u2019s the average case? That gets a little harder to do. But when in \u2013 the only weakness in the external stuff is it tends to be a percentage increase over the prior year, which is, of course, we work in absolute dollars. And our models are done in absolute dollars. And so even though it all depends where you start \u2013 but we like our overall position. Mario, do you want to talk specifically about any models that you\u2019re using now that think you can point to where we\u2019ve updated and increased the value-added?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. The one I\u2019d point to, and I think generally, the statement Tom made about like leveraging all the data and the capabilities we have, but also looking to tune those models and evolve over time. The example I would use would be around bodily injury, both potential loss identification and attorney representation. Given, obviously, the environment around us has evolved pretty significantly over the past couple of years in terms of higher levels of attorney representation and bodily injury claims and just medical inflation, medical consumption and treatment, those kinds of things. So what we\u2019ve been doing is tuning the models to be able to use the components and the data that we gather early on in the claims process, to identify claims where there is, first of all, the potential for an injury. More importantly, the potential for a major injury given it\u2019s a higher impact accident or things like that. So we can get out ahead of the claim, make contact earlier and manage the claim much more effectively. The same would be true around claims that have the potential, ultimately to be represented by an attorney. Again, creating contact with a third-party claimant and establishing dialogue and communication and leveraging the tools and the models at our disposal to better manage the claim process through the bodily injury claims. So those are just a couple of examples of how we tuned models that we\u2019ve had to adapt to the current environment. And we\u2019re going to have to continue to, as I mentioned earlier, evolve our processes and those models to adapt to the environment over time. So this is not a static process, and we\u2019re always looking to get better based on the most current information as well as the external environment that we\u2019re operating in.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, thanks a lot for getting me in. First question is around social inflation, and in particular, bad price point. And in 2022, I think the court up a lot. And we \u2013 I would \u2013 I suspect that had a big impact. As we move into 2023, what\u2019s your thinking about further social inflation issues? Do you think it will get materially worse? Could you give us some measurement around that? And that\u2019s the question.\nTom Wilson: Mario, do you want to take that?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Certainly, social inflation is a phenomenon that we and the industry have been dealing with for an extended period of time. I think in our business, we certainly see it in the personal auto side, in casualty coverages. We\u2019ve also seen it on commercial auto and in the shared economy, just given the higher limits that we tend to write on that business. It\u2019s hard for me to predict whether it will get better or get worse going forward. I think it\u2019s a reality of what we\u2019re experiencing right now. And as I talked about some of the analytics and the processes we\u2019re putting in place, to identify and manage injury claims more effectively. That\u2019s a big reason why we\u2019re doing it is in response to the social inflationary impacts we\u2019ve seen. I\u2019d also go back to something I said earlier around quickly not only identifying but settling claims earlier in the process where we can to mitigate the potential exposure to social inflation going forward. And the reduction in pending claims across a variety of segments that we\u2019ve already executed on and are going to continue to focus on going forward. So I think our approach has been to modify our processes and take appropriate actions to offset the impacts of social inflation. And again, I don\u2019t want to predict whether it will get better or get worse, but we know it\u2019s a reality and we\u2019ve adapted in response to it.\nAndrew Kligerman: Was there a big pickup in bad faith claims?\nMario Rizzo: I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a big pickup in bad faith claims now.\nAndrew Kligerman: Okay. And then the next question is around the rate increase. So I think Greg was touching on how your competitor got in the teens. I think it was 17.4% and you got 6.9%. My question there is should we worry that there will be anti-selection? If other players are getting these big rate increases, will that drive more consumers to Allstate as the pricing appears better in California?\nTom Wilson: Mario, do you want to take that?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Look, as I mentioned earlier, even with the rate that we were approved for \u2013 we didn\u2019t change the actions we took around down pay requirements. So our risk appetite is not \u2013 has not changed in California, and it won\u2019t until we get to a point where we believe we\u2019re adequately priced, and that will take at least a couple more rates. Will we get anti-selected against? I think if we keep the restrictions in place or down pay requirements in place, we mitigate that risk. And it\u2019s all relative. The rate increase that was approved was on a much larger indication than the one we filed. So it\u2019s hard to tell what the relative price position is. But again, we\u2019re not going to change our stance. Our focus in California is to reduce growth as much as we can until we get to rate-adequate levels, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to manage the business.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Question, please.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, thank you. I was looking at the new policy application, and I was trying to tease out Allstate, National General and agency versus exclusive agency versus direct. And I noticed that there was a non-significant amount of independent agency, new policy applications coming from non-National General sources. And so I\u2019m wondering, is Allstate brand being sold through independent agencies? And the reason why I asked this is also I noticed that new policy applications from Allstate exclusive agents are up, but Allstate branded new policy applications are down overall. Meaning that it feels like there\u2019s a channel shift that you\u2019re excited about getting business from Allstate exclusive agents, but not from the other sources where you sold Allstate branded products last year.\nTom Wilson: Let me provide a little overview. And then Mario you can take it. So Josh, first, we\u2019ll take business from anybody\u2019s, not just for price. You are correct in that you see \u2013 remember, National General, we took \u2013 when we acquired National General, we gave them both the Encompass business, which was straight up independent agents under the Encompass brand. There\u2019s also an Allstate independent agent channel that we\u2019re transitioning to National General products and services over time. So the National General has both of those. On the direct versus agent piece, we\u2019ve been shutting down growth and reducing expenses. We went first to the direct channel because it was faster, and we got more dollars out of it. That doesn\u2019t mean that we have a preference for Allstate agent versus direct. We\u2019ll serve customers any way they want to be served. Mario, do you want to add some additional perspective on that?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. And maybe I\u2019ll focus on \u2013 first on the Allstate brand, Josh, in terms of the shift, the mix shift between direct and exclusive agents. So you\u2019ll remember a couple of things. One of the things we did this year was we reduced the amount of advertising spend, particularly lower funnel advertising spend, which directly impacts both volume through the direct channel. And I think you\u2019ve seen a decline in the direct Allstate branded production as a result of that. I think the other thing you\u2019ve seen is the phenomenon we\u2019re experiencing in the exclusive agent channel with Allstate. And I\u2019ll take you back to one of the core tenets of transformative growth was to reduce costs. But one of the components of it was to reduce distribution costs by changing how we compensated our exclusive agents, and also introducing lower cost, higher productive new models. And I think what you see in 2022 is that the model that we put in, that shifts agency compensation more to new customer acquisition has driven a level of engagement and behavior change on behalf of our exclusive agents that\u2019s resulted in an increase in new business production, despite the rate actions that we\u2019ve taken. I think as we go forward, we\u2019re going to continue to evolve the agency model. We\u2019ll continue to shift commission away from renewal to new business. And while at the same time, continue to enhance our direct capabilities so that when we do lean back into growth, we\u2019re willing to accept the grow through any channel that we can write it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to assume that the first place you\u2019d see kind of sequential growth would be in the direct channel, just given that when we turn advertising back on, that will be where a lot of the claim volume is driven through. But at the same time, we are pleased with the \u2013 again, the engagement and the behavior shift of our exclusive agents and the performance of the new agency models in terms of their levels of productivity, which I think bode well for us from a long-term growth perspective.\nJosh Shanker: Is there a difference in profitability over the lifetime of the customer, depending on the brand and the channel it\u2019s sourced? And long-term, should there be any difference?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, I can jump in. Any Allstate brand, I think over time, it should be the same, right? Because we\u2019re targeting and marketing to the same customer segment and looking to drive the same lifetime value, whether we write it in the agency channel or we write it in the direct channel. And you\u2019ll remember, we\u2019ve gone to differentiated pricing to match the cost of the channel with the price that the consumer is paying. So that kind of normalizes for the acquisition cost or the distribution cost. So we\u2019d be getting the same lifetime value. I think in the National General brand, what we\u2019ve got today is predominantly still a non-standard mix, which has a very different lifetime value than the standard and preferred products that we write in the Allstate brands. But we price for that. We have the fee structure in place for that where \u2013 and we manage that business very effectively to drive value for a much shorter policy life expectancy for those non-standard risks. As we roll out more middle market products in National General, we\u2019ve really started on that process, but we\u2019ve got a ways to go there. The value \u2013 the lifetime value expectancy for that policy group should look and feel a lot like the Allstate brand because we\u2019re leveraging the same data, the same capabilities to expand our capabilities in that market. So I think from a customer segment perspective, it should be very similar across channels, given the same risk profile. Different in non-standard auto, but we\u2019ve got a really effective model in National General to manage that business.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you for answering my overly belabor questions.\nTom Wilson: I know that\u2019s very helpful. So thank you all for tuning in. Allstate\u2019s obviously focused on using our extensive system operating expertise to improve auto insurance margins. And at the same time, as Mario just mentioned, we\u2019re investing in transforming growth to increase our profit liability business. We have upside in front of us on the investment portfolio, and we\u2019re having a good successful expansion of our circle of protection. So thank you all, and we will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program.

            "content": "All right. Thank you, Mario. Well, property liability is a core business for us. There are other important drivers of financial performance to discuss, starting with investment income on Slide 13. As shown in the table at the bottom left, the total return of our portfolio is 2.5% in the fourth quarter and negative 4% for the year. These returns for our broadly diversified portfolio compare favorably to the full year performance for the S&P 500 of negative 18%, and to the Bloomberg Intermediate Bond Index return of negative 9%. Net investment income shown in the chart on the left totaled $557 million in the quarter, which is $290 million below fourth quarter last year. Market-based income of $464 million, which is shown in blue, was $101 million above the prior year quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter of increase as we benefit from reinvestment at higher market yields. Performance-based income of $147 million shown in black was $369 million below a strong prior year quarter. Income this quarter included in negative contribution from valuation of private equity fund investments that was more than offset by positive contributions from direct investments along with positive returns for infrastructure in real estate. The chart on the right shows the fixed income yield is rising and was 3.2% at quarter end, but is still below the current intermediate corporate bond yield at 5.3%. Also shown is that duration increased modestly to 3.4 in the fourth quarter, primarily by removing approximately half of our duration shortening interest rate derivatives. The migration of the portfolio to higher yield and the corresponding increase in income will happen over time as we reinvest portfolio cash flows into higher interest rates. With the portfolio in unrealized loss positions accelerating this shift by selling bonds to generate capital losses but will be pursued if it optimizes enterprise risk and return. Now let's turn to Slide 14 and talk more about how enterprise risk and return management impacts investment allocations and results. Proactive investment management is highly integrated with risk adjusted return opportunities across the enterprise. We discussed this in detail on our September 1 Special Topic call on investments. In 2021, we decided to lower overall risk levels given the declines in auto insurance profitability. We also expected that sustained inflation would lead to higher interest rates. As a result, the economic capital deployed to investments was reduced. This led to a shortening of the bond portfolio through the sale of long corporate and municipal bonds and the use of derivatives. While adverse market conditions negatively impacted our portfolio, these actions mitigated losses by approximately $2 billion. In 2022, giving continued auto insurance losses, we decided to lower the potential for investment losses as the U.S. economy went into recession. At the same time, interest rates were increasing, offering a better risk adjusted return from fixed income. Consequently, holdings and below investment grade bonds were cut almost in half, and public equity holdings were lowered by 40%. Late in the year, interest rates had increased in the duration of the bond portfolio was extended as shown on the previous slide. About half the duration shortening derivative position was removed in the fourth quarter, at the same time, this lowered the amount of economic capital deployed to investments. These actions optimize enterprise risk and return and provide flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities as economic conditions evolve. The Protection Services businesses also create shareholder value, as shown on Slide 15. Revenues, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, increased 6.1% to $643 million in the quarter and 8.7% to $2.5 billion for the full year 2022. The increase in revenue for the fourth quarter and full year was primarily driven by Allstate Protection Plans growth of 16.9% and 15.7% respectively. As you can see from the table on the right, Allstate Protection Plans continues to rapidly expand with written premium of $1.9 billion for the year. Allstate Protection Plans expansion in 2022 is primarily driven by our investment in appliance and furniture product coverages. We continue to believe there's a significant growth opportunity in these areas and in our continued expansion of European consumer electronics and other international growth. Given, the longer policy term compared to auto and homeowner's insurance products, the unearned premium balance continues to significantly grow as well, reaching $2.6 billion at the end of the year. For the segment, adjusted net income of $38 million in the quarter, increased $9 million compared to the prior year due to a one-time net tax benefit in Allstate Protection Plans. Full year adjusted net income of $169 million, decreased $10 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the lower revenue in Arity as a result of decreased insurer client advertising. We'll continue to invest in growing these businesses as they provide an attractive opportunity to meet customers' needs and create economic value for our shareholders. Moving on to Slide 16, Allstate Health and Benefits is growing an attractive set of businesses that protects more than 4 million policy holders. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual products to our portfolio as you can see on the left. Revenues of $579 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, decreased 1.5% to the prior year quarter as a reduction in individual health was partially offset by an increase in group health and other revenue. Adjusted net income of $50 million, increased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter, resulting in a full year 2022 income of $222 million. The full year 2022 result was $14 million above prior year and reflects increases in group health revenues partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses on group health contract benefits. Let's close by highlighting Allstate's strong financial condition and proactive approach to capital management, which you can see on Slide 17. We ended the year with $4 billion in holding company assets, which represents an increase of $700 million compared to year end 2021. We believe holding company assets and capital resources available from statutory operating companies provide financial flexibility as we continue to implement profit proven actions, invest in Transformative Growth and return capital to shareholders. As you can see, our adjusted net loss in 2022 resulted in a negative adjusted net income return on equity. Executing our comprehensive plan in achieving target combined ratios for auto and homeowners insurance will bring adjusted net income returns and equity back to our long-term target range of 14% to 17%. In 2022, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through $2.5 billion in share repurchases and $926 million in common shareholder dividends. This resulted in common shares outstanding being reduced by 6.1%, reflecting the repurchase of 19.7 million shares in 2022. With that as context, let's open the line for your questions. Yes. Thanks, Tom. So Elyse, I think as it relates to your question on RBC, we haven't disclosed the RBC for the year. That will come out in due course as it relates to the actual RBC in insurance company, and we don't publish a target. I think Tom hit on the right point, because you asked what are the metrics that we look at as we think about the repurchases. And we really do focus on our sophisticated economic capital model that looks at a comprehensive view of risk across types around the enterprise. And we use that as the basis for capital management. We obviously focus on RBC rating agency metrics, a variety of other things. But we don't have specific targets that we published as it relates to risk-based capital. So \u2013 and I really like to take it up a level and just think about how we manage it overall using our sophisticated, risk-based capital framework. We remain confident in our overall capital position and the capital position of the insurance subsidiaries."

            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time in Allstate today. I'll start by setting context and then Mario and Jess would provide additional perspective on operating results and the actions being taken to improve auto profitability and increase shareholder value. So let's begin on Slide 2. So as you know, Allstate strategy has two components: increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand Protection Services, which is shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right hand side, you can see our results for the year. Earnings were disappointing with a net loss of $1.4 billion, largely reflecting an underwriting loss on auto insurance and mark-to-market losses on the equity portfolio. Strong results from homeowners insurance, protection services and fixed income investments were not enough to offset the losses on auto and commercial insurance. The most important driver of near-term shareholder value will be successfully executing our comprehensive plan to improve auto profitability. That includes broadly raising auto insurance rates, reducing expenses including temporary moves such as less advertising and permanent reductions including digitizing and outsourcing work and lowering distribution costs. Underwriting restrictions have been implemented to reduce new business volume until profitability is acceptable. Claims operating processes are also being modified to manage our loss costs. This plan is being implemented, but earned premiums from auto insurance rates have not increased enough to offset higher loss costs. And while the number one priority is to improve auto insurance margins, implementation of the transformative growth strategies make great progress in 2022, and we validated that this will drive personal Property-Liability market share growth. Proactive investment risk and return management mitigated approximately $2 billion of loss this year. And while the total return on the portfolio was a negative 4%, that compares very favorably to the performance of the S&P 500 and intermediate bond indices. We also had another great year at Allstate Protection Plans. Moving to Slide 3, let's discuss financial results. Starting at the top, revenues of $13.6 billion in the fourth quarter were 4.9% higher than the prior year quarter, increasing the full year total to $51.4 billion. Property-Liability premiums earned increased by 9.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 8.5% for the full year due to higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance. Moving down the table, an adjusted net loss of $359 million was incurred in the fourth quarter reflecting an auto insurance underwriting loss, which is impacted by reserve increases for the current and prior years. Now let me turn it over to Mario to discuss our Property-Liability results and then Jess will cover the other components of earnings. Thank you, Paul. Good morning. Let me make a few overview comments and then Mario can jump in. You're correct that one of our competitive advantages really claim [indiscernible] settling what are millions of claims a year. And we really look at like a \u2013 it's a systems approach. It's not the result of adding one person process or vendor arrangement. But like for example, if you look at auto insurance, we have this network of auto body repair facilities enables us to both source high quality costs, high quality repairs, good costs and in timely stuff. So cutting down things like car, rental use and stuff like that. At the same time, we have extensive use of analytics, whether that's the value of an individual car in a local market with specific options to settlements of complicated multi-year bodily injury claims or fraud detection. Part sourcing and buying that Mario talked about enables us to both control the price of those parts by buying them in bulk. But also deciding which part you use. You use an OE [ph] part or an aftermarket part, what's available in the local market. So the reason I'm going through that is it's a really complicated system that works really well. We've got good employee training, got good technology, we have good quality control processes. And we do have metrics that you can look at to determine how we're doing versus the outside. There's first call reporting and there's some other external reporting which shows, for example, that we have. We buy \u2013 we pay less per claim for parts and labor than other people. So some of that information like first call you guys could have access to others \u2013 we get from other sources. But it \u2013 what it tells us is that we're good. Now, anytime you're good, the only reason \u2013 the only way you stay good is you keep changing and getting better and updating processes. And so as we've dealt with these dramatic swings and frequency and costs, we continue to implement changes to improve the effectiveness and efficiency and Mario can talk about those. Are we perfect? No. Are we constantly reassessing everything we do to make sure we're getting the right price for parts and we're settling at the right value for customers of course. Do we believe it's still a continued competitive advantage for Allstate? Yes. So Mario, would you want to talk about some of the things you worked on last year and what you have looking forward this year? Greg, let me provide an overview, then Mario can jump in on it. First, as we said and you know well that improving auto profitability will be a key to driving shareholder value. So we're all over that. We've made a lot of progress. Mario showed about the rate increases. And so of the $4.1 billion that we think will still come true, or that will come through from the rate increases we've already implemented, we've got $1.2 billion, $2.6 billion of that should show up in 2023. And I would point out that, that's not in those combined ratio numbers. So our objective is to make money in every line in every state. So no cross subsidies between states, no cross-subsidies between lines. Now, of course, that's hard to do with as many lines as many states we're in, but that's our objective. And so the amount \u2013 that amount that's not reflected in the \u2013 some of those states. We think some of those states are probably adequately priced today. There are many that are not, and so we'll continue to drive those. But I would expect to see that number come down. But we don't have a target of \u2013 we're at 41 at the end of the year. We want to be at some XX at the end of the first quarter. It's every state, every line, make money every year. Mario, would you want to add some additional color to that? Greg, I would just maybe provide \u2013 I think we've been very aggressive when you look at how much we've raised rates in total for the year across the country. We've been very aggressive. And depending whose measures you want to use, more aggressive. As you never really know where people start and what they finish and what their losses are. Mario, do you want to talk specifically about California? Elyse, I'll let Jess give you some specifics, but we obviously have a long history of managing capital that both balances our financial strength, growth returns to shareholders. We have plenty of capital to grow our business and pursue attractive risk and return opportunities. We do it in a much more sophisticated way than RBC. So for example, when Jess talked about the things we had done in the investment portfolio, that we allocate specific amounts of capital to different investment allocations. So when we dial up interest rate risk, we put a little more capital up for it. If we dial down equities, we put up less capital, and we believe we're really well capitalized and don't have any issues. Jess, do you want to go from there? Elyse, I'm not sure which predictive models are you talking about the \u2013 I mean we use predictive models for a lot in claims. Was there one specifically you were interested in? Okay. Yes. Let me \u2013 I'll take a shot at it and Mario, you can jump in. So we use \u2013 I mean we're a data-driven company, so we use predictive models as you know well, for just about everything. That could be fraud. There could be \u2013 do we think this claim might end up being severe enough where it gets represented by a lawyer? So it's important for us to establish a relationship with the customers as possible. It might be, do we think there's a better way to settle this claim, whether it gets \u2013 the car gets totaled or we send it to a body shop. So there's we use predictive analytics throughout the business and obviously largely in claims as well. So we're always tuning those. We think we're pretty good at it. You can't really take one specific algorithm. But when you look at our claims severities, you can look at them externally. And when you look at absolute dollars, we think we did really well. It's easier on physical damage, obviously, because you're just fixing a car bodily injury, it's like, okay, well, what was the case worth? What's the average case? That gets a little harder to do. But when in \u2013 the only weakness in the external stuff is it tends to be a percentage increase over the prior year, which is, of course, we work in absolute dollars. And our models are done in absolute dollars. And so even though it all depends where you start \u2013 but we like our overall position. Mario, do you want to talk specifically about any models that you're using now that think you can point to where we've updated and increased the value-added? Mario, do you want to take that? Mario, do you want to take that? Let me provide a little overview. And then Mario you can take it. So Josh, first, we'll take business from anybody's, not just for price. You are correct in that you see \u2013 remember, National General, we took \u2013 when we acquired National General, we gave them both the Encompass business, which was straight up independent agents under the Encompass brand. There's also an Allstate independent agent channel that we're transitioning to National General products and services over time. So the National General has both of those. On the direct versus agent piece, we've been shutting down growth and reducing expenses. We went first to the direct channel because it was faster, and we got more dollars out of it. That doesn't mean that we have a preference for Allstate agent versus direct. We'll serve customers any way they want to be served. Mario, do you want to add some additional perspective on that? I know that's very helpful. So thank you all for tuning in. Allstate's obviously focused on using our extensive system operating expertise to improve auto insurance margins. And at the same time, as Mario just mentioned, we're investing in transforming growth to increase our profit liability business. We have upside in front of us on the investment portfolio, and we're having a good successful expansion of our circle of protection. So thank you all, and we will talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's start by reviewing underwriting profitability for the Property-Liability business in total on Slide 4. The overall message is that the underwriting loss was a result of auto insurance operating at a combined ratio above our targets, but homeowners insurance continued to be a strong source of profit. On the left chart, the recorded combined ratio of 109.1 in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by higher auto loss costs, unfavorable reserve development and higher catastrophes. This led to a full year recorded combined ratio of 106.6, which was 10.7 points higher than the prior year. The table on the right shows the combined ratio and underwriting income by line of business for the quarter and the year. Auto insurance had a combined ratio of 112.6 in the quarter and 110.1 for the year, substantially worse than our targets given rapidly increasing loss costs throughout the year. This result was an underwriting loss of $974 million in the quarter and over $3 billion for the year. Hence, you can see why Tom has said executing our auto profit improvement plan is the number one priority going forward. Homeowners insurance, on the other hand, had excellent results with the combined \u2013 with combined ratios in the low 90s, which generated $681 million of underwriting income for the year. This reflects industry-leading underwriting and risk management in this line of business. Commercial insurance was negatively impacted by the same auto insurance cost pressures, along with inadequate pricing for the coverage provided to the large transportation network companies. The result was an underwriting loss for the year of $464 million. This led to the decision discussed last quarter to not provide insurance to transportation network companies unless telematics-based pricing is implemented and to exit five states in the Allstate traditional commercial business. These actions are expected to reduce commercial business premiums by over 50% in 2023. Now let's move to Slide 5 and discuss auto margin in more detail. As you can see from the chart on the left, which shows the auto insurance combined ratio and underlying combined ratio from 2017 through the current year, we have a long history of sustained profitability in auto insurance due to pricing sophistication, underwriting and claims expertise and expense management. In 2020, the combined ratio dropped to 86 even though we provided customers with over $1 billion of shelter-in-place payments. This was due to historically low accident frequency in the early stages of the pandemic. In 2021, frequency increased as mileage driven increased, but it did not reach pre-pandemic levels. Claims severity, however, increased above historical levels because of more severe increasing costs to settle claims with third parties, who are injured in accidents with our customers. In addition, used car prices were increasing at unprecedented levels, eventually peaking in December, reflecting an approximate 50% increase over the prior year. We had a reported combined ratio of 95 for the year despite all these pressures. This year, the combined ratio increased 14.7 points to 110.1, the drivers of which are shown in the right-hand chart. The red bars reflect the impact of increasing loss costs, including a 3.6 point impact from prior year reserve additions and a 16.7 point impact from current year underlying losses, excluding catastrophes, which include increases in both frequency and more significantly, severity compared to last year. As we discussed, the core component of the profit improvement plan is to raise auto insurance rates and substantial progress was made on this front starting in the fourth quarter of 2021 and throughout last year. In 2022, the impact of higher average earned premium drove a benefit of 3.6 points, which is shown in green. As I will cover in a minute, there is much more benefit to be realized in earned premiums based on what was implemented in 2022. Another part of the profit improvement plan is to reduce expenses and this contributed a favorable 2 point benefit this year. Moving to Slide 6. Let's discuss prior year reserve re-estimates before we look forward. Our loss estimates and reserve liabilities use consistent practices, multiple analytical methods and two external actuarial reviews to ensure reserve adequacy. These processes led us to increase the reserve liability for prior years throughout 2022 by amounts that are larger than recent years. Property-Liability prior year reserve strengthening, excluding catastrophes totaled $1.7 billion or 3.9 points on the combined ratio for the full year 2022. The pie chart on the left breaks down the impact by line and coverage with $1.1 billion driven by Allstate Brand personal auto largely related to bodily injury claims. In addition $295 million was related to Allstate Brand commercial insurance, also mostly related to auto. The table on the right breaks down the Allstate Brand auto prior year reserve strengthening of $1.1 billion in 2022 by report year. Let me orient you to the table. Reserve increases are shown by coverage in total and then for the report here to which they apply. The reserve liability for physical damage coverages was increased by $211 million, which was entirely attributable to 2021. This primarily related to adverse development and elongated repair time frames, which were primarily addressed in the first and second quarter. Injury reserves were the largest component at $676 million, which was spread across many report years. Incurred but not reported was increased by $226 million as late reported claim counts have exceeded prior estimates. This reserve balance was increased in each of the first three quarters of 2022, but a larger amount was recorded in the fourth quarter. In total for all coverages about 63% of the increases were for 2021 and 2020. At the bottom of the table, the reported combined ratio for the calendar year is shown and compared to the reserve changes. For example in 2021, the reported combined ratios for Allstate Brand auto insurance was 95. The reserve additions indicate that costs were 2.1 points above this reported number. Estimating reserve liability utilizes multiple reserving techniques, but is always subject to strengthening or releasing reserves over time. This variability increases with changes in the underlying data, such as claim counts, settlement times, or cost increases and as has been the case over the past three years. While reserves could change going forward, based on the 2022 claim statistics and data, reserves are appropriately established at year-end 2022. Moving to Slide 7. Let's provide some clarity on what the auto insurance combined ratio trend was by quarter in 2022. As you can see on the left-hand chart, the recorded combined ratio peaked in the third quarter at 117.4, largely reflecting prior year reserve changes and catastrophe losses shown in light blue. The dark blue bars are the underlying combined ratio, as reported, which increased each quarter. Included in this dark blue bar is the impact of increasing claim severities within the year. We update the forecast on claim severities as the year progresses. As 2022 developed, loss cost trends resulted in increases to current report year ultimate severity expectations. As shown in the call out on the left chart, 2022 incurred severities for collision, property damage and bodily injury was 17%, 21% and 14%, respectively, above the full report year 2021 level. This estimate, however, increased throughout the year. The impact of increasing current report year on incurred severities as the year progressed influences the quarter underlying combined ratio trend. This impact from increasing full year severities from claims occurring in prior quarters is reflected in the financial results of the period where severities were increased. For example, the fourth quarter of 2022 reflects the impact of higher severity expectations in the auto physical damage coverage, not just for claims reported in Q4 but also for claims that were reported throughout the prior three quarters as well. The chart on the right adjusts the quarterly underlying combined ratio to reflect full year average severity levels, which removes the influence of intra-year severity changes. As you can see, after adjusting for the timing of severity increases in the current year, the quarterly underlying combined ratio trend was essentially flat throughout 2022 and close to the full year level of 103.6. Slide 8 outlines our comprehensive approach to restore auto margins. There are four areas of focus: raising rates; a continued focus on reducing expenses; implementing stricter underwriting requirements; and modifying claim practices to manage loss costs. Starting with rates, since the beginning of this year, we've implemented rate increases of 16.9% in the Allstate Brand, including 6.1% in the fourth quarter, which significantly increased written premium. We expect to continue to pursue significant rate increases into 2023 to improve auto insurance margins to target levels. We are also reducing operating expenses as part of transformative growth and have temporarily reduced advertising spend to manage new business volume. We are implementing more restrictive underwriting actions on new business in locations or risk segments where we cannot achieve adequate prices for the risk. Increased restrictions have been implemented in 37 states including California, New York and New Jersey, which account for a large portion of underwriting losses. Claim practices have been modified to deal with the higher loss cost environment. For example, we have strategic partnerships with part suppliers and repair facilities to mitigate the cost of repair and use predictive modeling to optimize repair versus total loss decisions and likelihood of injury and attorney representation. Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss a key component of our multifaceted plan raising auto insurance prices. Growth in average premium per policy is accelerating due to implemented rate increases, but the impact to average earned premium per policy is on a lag due to the six-month policy term. The chart on the left depicts the year-over-year growth in auto average gross written premium in orange, reaching 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The auto average earned premium growth of 9.7% in the fourth quarter, represented in blue, continues to increase, but on a lag due to the six-month policy term. The chart on the right is an estimation of when the rate increase is implemented will be earned into premiums. Of course, actual earned premium growth will be influenced by changes in the number of policies in force and absolute levels of new business and retention. This illustrative example assumes 85% of the annualized written premium will be earned since customers modify policy terms such as deductibles or limits where they may not renew. Starting on the left, over the last 15 months, we've implemented Allstate brand auto rate increases of 19.8% for an estimated annualized written premium impact of approximately $4.8 billion. Using the historical 85% effectiveness assumption nets a total of $4.1 billion in expected earned premium, represented by the second blue bar. Approximately $1.2 billion has been earned through the fourth quarter. Of the remaining $2.9 billion of premium yet to be earned, roughly $2.6 billion will be earned in 2023 and $300 million in 2024 as shown in green. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to implement additional rate increases in 2023, which will be additive to the figures shown on this chart. Slide 10 illustrates the drivers that will determine the timing of improved auto profitability. The chart on this page is an illustrative view we've shown in the past on our path to target profitability along with the magnitude of actions already taken and required prospectively. Starting on the left, the first blue bar shows the year-end 2022 auto insurance reported combined ratio 110.1. To start with the normalized base, we removed the impact of prior year reserve increases and normalized the catastrophe loss ratio for our five-year historical average. This improves the combined ratio by roughly 4.5 points. The second green bar reflects the estimated impact of rate actions already implemented when fully earned into premium, which we discussed on the prior slide. The impact on the combined ratio is approximately 10.5 points when combining the Allstate brand and the National General brand actions. Those two adjustments would improve the combined ratio to target levels. Now of course, we know that loss costs will increase, whether from severity or accident frequency, which would increase the combined ratio. So prospective rate increases and other margin improvement actions must meet or exceed loss cost increases to achieve historical returns. We continue to manage the auto insurance business with the expectation to achieve an auto insurance combined ratio target in the mid-90s. Moving to Slide 11, the table shows Allstate brand auto results in three major states: California, New York and New Jersey combined contributed approximately a quarter of the Allstate brand auto written premiums in 2022 but accounted for approximately 45% of the underwriting loss. While rates were increased in 2022 by 7% to 10%, this is not enough to achieve target margins. As a result, we have more work to do, some of which is listed on the right-hand side. The right-hand side of the slide is a list of actions we are taking in each of these states to improve margins. In California, we filed for an additional 6.9% rate increase in January after getting approval for an initial 6.9% rate increase and are significantly increasing down payment requirements. In New York, while multiple rate filings were requested, only partial approval of the increases requires us to make additional rate filings in early 2023, increased down payment requirements, allowable prior incidents and channel restrictions means fewer choices for consumers until an adequate rate is approved. In New Jersey, additional rate filings will also be made and similar underwriting actions will be implemented as those taken in New York. Moving to Slide 12. Let's look at a continued good performance story in homeowners insurance. As you know a significant portion of our customers bundle home and auto insurance, which improves retention and the overall economics of both product lines. We have a differentiated homeowners product, underwriting, reinsurance and claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. Net written premium has increased significantly throughout 2021 and into 2022, increasing 9.3% from the prior year quarter and 12% for the full year, predominantly driven by higher average gross written premium per policy and a 1.4% increase in policies in force. National general written premiums also increased as we improved underwriting margins closer to targeted levels. The fourth quarter combined ratio for homeowners of 92.6 increased by 5.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, while full year combined ratio of 93.8 and declined by 3 points compared to 2021. For the year, this line generated $681 million of underwriting income. The increase in the fourth quarter is shown on the right side. The increased combined ratio was driven by elevated catastrophe losses, primarily due to winter storm Elliot. Homeowners insurance was also impacted by the higher loss cost environment as we continue to experience higher severities due to increasing labor and material costs. To address the inflationary environment, our products have sophisticated pricing features that respond to changes in home replacement values. And now I'll turn it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results. Yes, thanks Tom, and thanks for the question, Paul. First thing, I would reiterate what Tom said. We continue to view our claims capabilities as a competitive differentiator and a source of real value for Allstate. We think that's been \u2013 certainly been true in the past and it'll continue to be true going forward. The reality is given the environment we're operating in, both from a casualty perspective as well as physical damage, we've talked a lot throughout the year around the drivers of inflation and the things that are driving up loss costs at such a rapid pace. And I think what that does is it really forces us and the industry to continue to evolve those practices. And it's certainly something we've done overtime to continue to maintain in our leadership position and our edge when it comes to claims. So let me just spend a minute and I'll break out casualty versus physical damage. In terms of the action plans, we talk a lot about changing operational processes. I'll say a couple things starting with casualty first. One of the things we've done over the past 12 plus months is we've meaningfully reduced the volume of pending bodily injury claims by about 20%. And what that does is it reduces risk of both of inflation impacting those claims that certainly that we've settled and remediated going forward. But also reduces we think reserve uncertainty on those claims going forward. And to just give you a sense of context, the current level of bodily injury pending claims in aggregate is at its lowest level that it's been since before 2016. So we've looked to de-risk the bodily injury pending portfolio by leaning in and settling claims. We're also focusing on a strategy that I would characterize as an earlier strategy when it comes to bodily injury. Things like earlier recognition of injury claims, earlier claimant contact and earlier settlement of claims that we should settle quickly again to avoid the inflationary risk in the current environment. And what we're doing is we're leveraging our advanced data and analytics capabilities to execute on all components of that strategy to continue to evolve and get better in casualty claim handling. On the physical damage side, I think it's really around, broadly continuing to focus on estimation accuracy cycle time and leveraging \u2013 further leveraging our scale to the fullest extent. It's continuing to increase the utilization of our good hands repair network to reduce costs, both in terms of parts and labor costs and improve cycle time while continuing to improve or provide a high quality customer experience. Enhancing total loss processes to reduce cycle time and reduce costs around things like storage and rental costs and identification of preexisting damage on vehicles, again, to move total losses through the system more rapidly. And then continuing to look to leverage our scale additionally when it comes to sourcing parts and getting as efficient as we can from a process perspective. So we're really attacking claims across a number of fronts. Again, feel really good about where we're positioned with claims. And this is all about continuing to get better and maintain that industry leading capability on the claim side. This is Mario. Yes, sure. I'll jump in. Process wise, we adopt consistent processes across claims. There's certainly unique processes. For example, in National General, given the non-standard auto mix, there's just a different approach to those claims because they potentially have a higher risk of fraud. So there's some unique processes there. But in terms of claim handling consistency for similar types of claims, we tend to leverage best practices across brands. Sure. And thanks for the question, Greg. Look, I think when you look at that trend of states above 100 and the increase throughout the year, I think what I'd point you to is when you just \u2013 you look at our underlying auto combined ratio as we reported it, increasing throughout the year and being driven by increases in our severity expectations quarter-over-quarter as the year played out, as well as increasing frequency between Q1 through Q4, only partially being offset by the rate that we took. So I think that chart mirrors what we show you in aggregate in terms of the reported underlying combined ratio. But when you look at our business from a state perspective, I think it's important to really categorize states into a couple of different buckets. I think there's a group of states that while we certainly are pleased with the outcome of an underwriting loss, given the actions we've taken, particularly from a rate perspective as well as underwriting actions, we feel like we're positioned in a good place. Now you can't predict the future in terms of the path of inflation or severity going forward. But given the actions we've taken, we feel good about where we're positioned and what the outlook looks like for 2023. I put states like Texas, Georgia, a couple of large states for us where we've implemented significant rates and have been successful in doing so. And so we feel good about the outlook. Again, we'll have to adapt to what changes in the future, but I think there is a lot of states that falls into that category. Unfortunately, there is a number of, for us, pretty meaningful states, three of which we highlighted in the presentation: California, New York, New Jersey, where they're much more challenging regulatory environments. And we need to continue to execute on both rate increases and underwriting restrictions to curb growth to really bend the line in aggregate. And just using California as one example. So as you all know, we got a 6.9% rate approved late in the year, but we immediately filed another 6.9% increase pending with the department. We took down paid requirements up pretty dramatically. We have not changed those down paid requirements even with the first rate. We're working with the department on getting approval for the second 6.9%. But then we're going to come back with another rate increase because we need more rate in California. So that's a big state for us where we're going to have to continue to really lean in and take \u2013 continue to take dramatic and aggressive actions to improve margins. And I put New York in that same category. We got a 5% flex rate in New York. Middle of the year, we got approval for a 9.4% rate in New York towards the end of the year, while we're prepared to do additional \u2013 an additional round of rate filings in New York early in 2023, because loss trends are not where they need to be. And in the interim, we've taken underwriting actions around prior incidents, down pay and other actions to curb new business growth, and we're going to continue to lean into those actions because we can't afford to write the new business at the current rate levels and we'll continue to take the appropriate actions there. So I think you got to look at the states in a different way. I think we've made a lot of progress in a number of states, but we still have some work to do. And as we said, we expect to take some pretty significant rate increases in 2023, particularly leaning into some of those states where we haven't, really for regulatory reasons been able to make the kind of progress that we would have liked. Yes. Sure. So, Greg, I think we've been working really closely with the Department of Insurance in California. We were able to pretty rapidly get approval of our first 6.9%, and we're in active dialogue around the second 6.9%. And as I mentioned, when we get that one behind us, there'll be a third one coming. We always have the option of going down the path of filing a larger rate increase. California generally takes a longer time period to get approvals for rates as it is. And the one you mentioned specifically, I think, have been pending with the department for over a year. So we're \u2013 as we look at the map, we want to get approval, we want to get approval as rapidly as we can, so we can implement the rates and move on. So the approach we've taken so far in California, we're comfortable with. We're going to continue to lean in. We always have the option to change course if things change. But so far, we've had success with the path we've taken, and we're going to continue to push on that. Yes. The one I'd point to, and I think generally, the statement Tom made about like leveraging all the data and the capabilities we have, but also looking to tune those models and evolve over time. The example I would use would be around bodily injury, both potential loss identification and attorney representation. Given, obviously, the environment around us has evolved pretty significantly over the past couple of years in terms of higher levels of attorney representation and bodily injury claims and just medical inflation, medical consumption and treatment, those kinds of things. So what we've been doing is tuning the models to be able to use the components and the data that we gather early on in the claims process, to identify claims where there is, first of all, the potential for an injury. More importantly, the potential for a major injury given it's a higher impact accident or things like that. So we can get out ahead of the claim, make contact earlier and manage the claim much more effectively. The same would be true around claims that have the potential, ultimately to be represented by an attorney. Again, creating contact with a third-party claimant and establishing dialogue and communication and leveraging the tools and the models at our disposal to better manage the claim process through the bodily injury claims. So those are just a couple of examples of how we tuned models that we've had to adapt to the current environment. And we're going to have to continue to, as I mentioned earlier, evolve our processes and those models to adapt to the environment over time. So this is not a static process, and we're always looking to get better based on the most current information as well as the external environment that we're operating in. Yes. Certainly, social inflation is a phenomenon that we and the industry have been dealing with for an extended period of time. I think in our business, we certainly see it in the personal auto side, in casualty coverages. We've also seen it on commercial auto and in the shared economy, just given the higher limits that we tend to write on that business. It's hard for me to predict whether it will get better or get worse going forward. I think it's a reality of what we're experiencing right now. And as I talked about some of the analytics and the processes we're putting in place, to identify and manage injury claims more effectively. That's a big reason why we're doing it is in response to the social inflationary impacts we've seen. I'd also go back to something I said earlier around quickly not only identifying but settling claims earlier in the process where we can to mitigate the potential exposure to social inflation going forward. And the reduction in pending claims across a variety of segments that we've already executed on and are going to continue to focus on going forward. So I think our approach has been to modify our processes and take appropriate actions to offset the impacts of social inflation. And again, I don't want to predict whether it will get better or get worse, but we know it's a reality and we've adapted in response to it. I wouldn't say there's a big pickup in bad faith claims now. Yes. Look, as I mentioned earlier, even with the rate that we were approved for \u2013 we didn't change the actions we took around down pay requirements. So our risk appetite is not \u2013 has not changed in California, and it won't until we get to a point where we believe we're adequately priced, and that will take at least a couple more rates. Will we get anti-selected against? I think if we keep the restrictions in place or down pay requirements in place, we mitigate that risk. And it's all relative. The rate increase that was approved was on a much larger indication than the one we filed. So it's hard to tell what the relative price position is. But again, we're not going to change our stance. Our focus in California is to reduce growth as much as we can until we get to rate-adequate levels, and that's the way we're going to manage the business. Yes. And maybe I'll focus on \u2013 first on the Allstate brand, Josh, in terms of the shift, the mix shift between direct and exclusive agents. So you'll remember a couple of things. One of the things we did this year was we reduced the amount of advertising spend, particularly lower funnel advertising spend, which directly impacts both volume through the direct channel. And I think you've seen a decline in the direct Allstate branded production as a result of that. I think the other thing you've seen is the phenomenon we're experiencing in the exclusive agent channel with Allstate. And I'll take you back to one of the core tenets of transformative growth was to reduce costs. But one of the components of it was to reduce distribution costs by changing how we compensated our exclusive agents, and also introducing lower cost, higher productive new models. And I think what you see in 2022 is that the model that we put in, that shifts agency compensation more to new customer acquisition has driven a level of engagement and behavior change on behalf of our exclusive agents that's resulted in an increase in new business production, despite the rate actions that we've taken. I think as we go forward, we're going to continue to evolve the agency model. We'll continue to shift commission away from renewal to new business. And while at the same time, continue to enhance our direct capabilities so that when we do lean back into growth, we're willing to accept the grow through any channel that we can write it. But I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that the first place you'd see kind of sequential growth would be in the direct channel, just given that when we turn advertising back on, that will be where a lot of the claim volume is driven through. But at the same time, we are pleased with the \u2013 again, the engagement and the behavior shift of our exclusive agents and the performance of the new agency models in terms of their levels of productivity, which I think bode well for us from a long-term growth perspective. Yes, I can jump in. Any Allstate brand, I think over time, it should be the same, right? Because we're targeting and marketing to the same customer segment and looking to drive the same lifetime value, whether we write it in the agency channel or we write it in the direct channel. And you'll remember, we've gone to differentiated pricing to match the cost of the channel with the price that the consumer is paying. So that kind of normalizes for the acquisition cost or the distribution cost. So we'd be getting the same lifetime value. I think in the National General brand, what we've got today is predominantly still a non-standard mix, which has a very different lifetime value than the standard and preferred products that we write in the Allstate brands. But we price for that. We have the fee structure in place for that where \u2013 and we manage that business very effectively to drive value for a much shorter policy life expectancy for those non-standard risks. As we roll out more middle market products in National General, we've really started on that process, but we've got a ways to go there. The value \u2013 the lifetime value expectancy for that policy group should look and feel a lot like the Allstate brand because we're leveraging the same data, the same capabilities to expand our capabilities in that market. So I think from a customer segment perspective, it should be very similar across channels, given the same risk profile. Different in non-standard auto, but we've got a really effective model in National General to manage that business."

After prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, please be aware that this call is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome to Allstate's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation on our website allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2021 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Additionally, we will be hosting our next special topic investor call on December 2, focusing on Allstate's auto and home insurance claims practices and reserving process. And now I'll turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Wilson: Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time with Allstate today. As you know, we pre-released earnings several weeks ago and reported the net loss for the quarter. That reflected a small underlying, underwriting margin that was offset by increases in reserves for prior years and a mark-to-market loss on public equity securities. . Mario and Jeff will go through the details of the quarter and the reserve changes after I set some context. So let's start on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy to increase shareholder value has two components: increase personal profit liability market share and expand protection services, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. We're building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution through transfer onto growth to increase market share. We're also broadening protection offerings and leveraging the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities with expanded distribution. In the third quarter, we made progress executing this strategy, while we continue to implement a comprehensive approach to improve auto profitability, which is shown in the right-hand panel, that includes broadly raising auto insurance rates, which you've seen in our disclosures. Operating expenses were lowered, including advertising and more permanent reductions in the operating cost structure. Underwriting guidelines have been adjusted to reduce new business volume where we're not earning adequate returns. Our claims operating processes are being modified to manage loss cost in a high inflation environment. And we believe this plan will return auto insurance profitability to historical levels. While the current environment requires focus on improving margins, we continue to advance and transform our growth strategy to gain market share when profitability improves. In addition, the protection services businesses is generating profitable growth. Investment returns were negative for the quarter and year-to-date, but better than the overall declines in the bond and equity markets. This reflects risk reductions implemented late last year. So you'll remember, we reduced the bond portfolio duration to lower exposure to high interest rates, which enabled us to avoid about $2 billion in losses in the bond portfolio. Our capital position is strong, and as a result, we were able to deliver attractive returns to shareholders. And Jess is going to discuss capital in his section, but let me provide a few summary points since this was covered in some of the reports issued last night. First, we have plenty of capital, and there's $4.5 billion of deployable capital at the holding. Secondly, the significant reduction in risk with the sale of the life and annuity operations occurred last October and that needs to be considered. This divestiture reduced assets by $34 billion and freed up capital. Thirdly, we use a really sophisticated approach to determining our capital that goes far beyond statutory capital and premium to surplus ratios. For example, if you just use statutory capital measure, the life company equity would be included in capital historically, which we did not believe was appropriate, so we never included it. So our methodology has led to strong results. We did decide to complete the remaining $1.4 billion stock repurchase over more than the next six months, which was our prior target we had disclosed to, but we still expect to complete it in the second or third quarter of next year. So in summary, we're really well capitalized, and this year's results have not changed our strategy or earnings power. Now let's move to Slide 3 to go through the third quarter performance in detail. Total revenues of $13.2 billion or 5.8% over the prior year quarter as property liability premiums earned increased by $5 billion or 9.8%, which reflected higher average premiums and policy growth. Lower net investment income and net losses on investments and derivatives negatively impacted the year-over-year considering our comparison there. A net loss of $694 million and an adjusted net loss of $420 million in the third quarter reflected a decline in underwriting income due to an increase in profit liability, prior year reserve estimates, which was $875 million that excludes catastrophes and increased loss costs in the current year. Looking forward, beyond improving profits in auto insurance, if you go to Slide 4, you'll see the flywheel of growth that will increase personal profit liability market share. So this is a multiyear initiative designed to build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution, that will be accomplished by delivering on five key objectives: improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, deploying new technology ecosystems and enhancing organizational capabilities. We made significant progress on all these components, and we're well on the way to having really being in a position where we can dial up growth quite rapidly when profitability improves. Now let me turn it over to Mario, and he'll go through our property-liability results.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Let's start by reviewing underwriting profitability for the Property Liability business in total on Slide 5. Our underwriting results reflect the high level of inflation and the impact of reserve strengthening in the quarter with a third quarter recorded combined ratio of 117.4% for auto, 91.2% for homeowners, 126.6% for all other lines and 111.6% for total property liability, which is shown on the left chart. Remember, our goal is to run the auto business with a combined ratio in the mid-90s and homeowners at around 90, while homeowners was close to our target in the quarter, we continue to focus on improving auto margins through a comprehensive plan that is being implemented to get us back to our mid-90s objective. The third quarter underlying combined ratio for auto insurance was 104, as you can see on the right. So we're raising auto insurance prices, reducing growth investments, lowering operating expenses and adapting claims practices to a high inflationary environment. While the homeowners business generated $245 million of underwriting profit, higher severity resulted in an underlying combined ratio of 74.6%, which is above where we manage it to, and we are increasing prices through both rates and the inflationary adjustment factor embedded in our homeowners product to improve underlying margins going forward. One of the reasons that we have an industry-leading homeowners business is because we proactively manage the risk and return profile of each market that we operate in. Based on this approach, we have decided to stop writing new homeowners and condo insurance in California at this time, given our inability to fully reflect the cost of providing these products in the state, including both loss and reinsurance costs. We intend to continue protecting our existing California property customers by offering ongoing coverage to them. Other lines are mainly traditional small commercial auto and shared economy insurance, both of which have recorded and underlying combined ratios above target levels. As a result, we made the decision to exit 5 states in the traditional small commercial business and no longer provide insurance to transportation network companies unless pricing begins to utilize a telematics-based framework for pricing. These actions are expected to reduce commercial business premiums by over 50% next year. Let's move to Slide 6 and discuss auto profitability in more detail. As you can see from the chart on the left, which shows the auto insurance combined ratio and underlying combined ratio over time. We have a long history of meeting or outperforming our mid- combined ratio target, supported by our pricing sophistication, underwriting and claims equities and expense management. 2020 is an outlier with much better than target results due to reduced accident frequency in the early stages of the pandemic. In 2021 and again this year, we have experienced both higher frequency than 2020 and the impacts of inflation, which have dramatically increased the cost to repair or replace cars and raise the cost of settling injury claims with third parties who are injured in accidents with our customers. In addition, this quarter, we strengthened prior year reserves by $643 million, which Jeff will discuss in more detail in a few minutes and experienced higher catastrophe losses mainly from flooding associated with Hurricane in. As a result, the auto insurance recorded combined ratio was 117.4% with reserve strengthening and catastrophes contributing 8.5 and 4.4 points, respectively, to this result. The right chart quantifies the drivers in the year-over-year change in the underlying combined ratio, which increased from 97.6 to 104 and excludes catastrophes and the reserve changes. The red bar reflects the increase in underlying losses, primarily due to current report year incurred severity strengthening across major coverages and moderately higher frequency than last year. The increase to underlying loss costs were partially offset by 4.3 points of average earned premiums from implemented rate increases and a 3.1 point reduction in underwriting expenses to get to the 104. To add more clarity to the current quarter results, we also highlight the 2.6 point impact of increasing full year claim severities in the third quarter for claims that were reported in the first and second quarter of this year. This impact is noted by the green bar on the right-hand chart. Excluding this intra-year strengthening, the third quarter underlying combined ratio would have been 101.4. Current report year incurred severity for collision and property damage claims were increased to 17% above the level reported for the full year 2021, and bodily injury severity was increased to 12%. Moving to Slide 7, let's discuss key components of our multifaceted plan to deal with inflation, raising auto insurance prices. Growth in average premium per policy is accelerating due to implemented rate increases over the last 12 months, but the impact to average earned premium per policy is on a lag due to the 6-month policy term. Over the last 12 months, we've implemented Allstate brand auto rate increases across 53 locations for an annualized written premium impact of approximately 13.7% or nearly $3.3 billion, including 4.7% in the third quarter. The chart on the page is an estimation of when the rate increases implemented in the last 12 months will be earned into premiums. This illustrative example assumes only 85% of the annualized written premium will be earned to account for retention and the fact that some customers modify policy terms, such as deductibles or limits when faced with price increases. As you can see, looking back at Q3 2022, the estimated impact of the $3.3 billion in annualized implemented rate had only an estimated impact of $660 million on earned premium, which is expected to grow by over $2.1 billion through the end of next year. Given the ongoing loss cost inflation, we expect to implement additional rate increases in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2023, and those will be on top of increases implemented since Q4 of last year and additive to the increases shown here. Moving to Slide 8, let's discuss the timing of how these rate increases will impact the combined ratio for auto insurance. The chart on this page is an illustrative view to show our path to target profitability, along with the magnitude of actions already taken and required prospectively. Starting on the left, through the first nine months of the year, the auto insurance recorded combined ratio is 109.3% as shown by the first blue bar. From this starting point, we removed the impact of prior year reserve increases and normalize the catastrophe loss ratio to our 5-year historical average. This improves the combined ratio by approximately 6 points represented by the first green bar. The second green bar reflects the estimated impact of rate actions already implemented when fully earned in the premium which is an additional $2.3 billion of premium across the Allstate and National General brands or approximately 8 points. These amounts will be mostly earned by the end of 2023. Of course, loss costs will likely continue to increase, whether from inflationary impacts on severity or higher accident frequency, which would increase the combined ratio. Prospective rate increases must meet or exceed loss cost increases to achieve historical returns. Combined with other non-rate actions such as reducing new business and expenses, we expect to achieve an auto insurance combined ratio target in the mid-90s. The timing of reaching this goal will be largely dependent on the relative increase in premiums and future loss cost trends. Moving to Slide 9. Let's now take a look at our industry-leading homeowners business. As you know, a significant portion of our customers bundle home and auto insurance, which improves retention and the overall economics of both product lines. We have a differentiated homeowners product, underwriting, reinsurance and claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. Our long-term under result -- underwriting results reflect this dynamic with a 5-year average recorded combined ratio of 91.9%. The third quarter combined ratio for homeowners improved to 91.2%, primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses compared to the prior year quarter, as you can see by the chart on the left. Enterprise risk and return management actions reduced our Florida personal property market share to 2.6%, which, combined with a comprehensive reinsurance program, including our stand-alone Florida property coverage, significantly mitigated net losses from Hurricane Ian. Estimated gross catastrophe losses due to the hurricane totaled $671 million and were reduced by $305 million in expected reinsurance recoveries, primarily related to property reinsurance for our stand-alone Florida property insurance company, . Of the $366 million net loss from Ian, only approximately 25% was from property lines. Homeowners insurance is certainly not immune to the rising inflationary environment as we continue to be impacted by increasing labor and material costs. In the third quarter, non-catastrophe prior year reserves were strengthened by $51 million, and current report year incurred severity was increased primarily as a result of increasing inflation in both labor and material costs. The resulting impact to the underlying combined ratio from current year severity strengthening was 3.8 points in the third quarter, partially offset by slightly lower non-catastrophe frequency. Similar to auto insurance, there was an intra-year impact of 2.4 points related to claims reported in the first and second quarter of this year, which was reflected in the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2022. To combat inflation challenges, our products have sophisticated pricing features that respond to changes in replacement values. The chart on the right shows key homeowners insurance operating statistics. Net written premium has grown sharply throughout 2021 and into 2022, increasing 9.4% from the prior year quarter and 12.9% year-to-date, primarily driven by a more than 13% increase in Allstate brand average gross premium per policy and a 1.4% increase in policies in force. The Allstate brand increases are partially offset by lower National General premiums and policies in force as we improve underwriting margins to targeted levels in this brand. We are continuing to raise homeowners' prices to address inflationary pressures, both through the impact of inflation on insured home valuations and filed rate increases. Beyond these pricing actions, we have also decided to limit new business where margin targets cannot be achieved in the near term, including the action I previously noted of suspending the sale of new homeowners insurance policies to consumers in California. Let's delve deeper into improving customer value through expense reductions on Slide 10. Let me start by saying we remain on pace and committed to our long-term objective to reduce our adjusted expense ratio which is a metric we introduced about a year ago to track our underlying progress to improve customer value. This metric starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding things like restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. Through innovation and strong execution, we've achieved almost three points of improvement since 2018. Over time, we expect to drive more than three points of additional improvements from current levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024, and which represents a 6-point reduction compared to 2018. The chart on the slide shows the Allstate Protection underwriting expense ratio since 2018 and quantifies the impacts from third quarter 2022 compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting actions we've taken to address the current operating environment. The first green bar on the left shows the decline in advertising spend as growth investments have been reduced given our focus on improving margins. The next green bar shows a decline in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, primarily driven by the phaseout of enhanced compensation models for new agents. Our future cost reduction efforts are focused on digitization, sourcing and operating efficiency and continuing to reduce distribution costs. Let me now turn it over to Jess to discuss our reserving actions in the quarter and the remainder of our business results in more detail.\nJess Merten: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 11, let's begin with our prior year reserve development, property liability, prior year reserve strengthening, excluding catastrophes totaled $875 million in the third quarter. The pie chart on the left breaks down the impact by line with $643 million, driven by personal auto, $120 million one-off property liability from our annual reserve review related to environmental and asbestos exposures, $63 million in commercial, largely related to auto bodily injury and $51 million in homeowners. . The chart on the right breaks down Allstate Protection auto prior year reserve strengthening of $643 million in the third quarter, which was primarily driven by noncustomer claim and bodily injury claims. The total cost to settle these claims continues to be impacted by more severe accidents and higher medical and litigation costs. Increases to commercial and homeowners insurance can also be attributed to these factors. Physical damage prior year reserve increases in the third quarter from property damage collision and comprehensive coverages, excluding catastrophes, were largely offset by higher subrogation collection estimates. Now let's move to Slide 12 to discuss the drivers of bodily injury development and our claims operating actions to manage loss costs. Bodily injury severities have increased as the mix of claims shifted to more costly claim segments. The chart on the left shows the relative severity of bodily injury claims by type of treatment, major versus non-major and whether the claim is unrepresented, attorney represented or litigated. Major injuries have more expensive medical treatments, greater nonmedical related damages and often more attorney involvement. As a result, paid severity for major injury claims and litigation represented by the first bar on the left costs approximately 3.9x the average paid bodily injury claim. Non-major claims shown on the right-hand side of the chart, have less medical and other related costs intend not to have attorney costs, so unrepresented nonmajor injury claims are roughly 10% of the average cost. Let me be clear, in all cases, we settled the cases for what is fair and equitable regardless of attorney involvement. The table below the chart shows a significant shift from nonmajor claims that have below average cost to major injuries that are represented or in litigation in comparison to historical levels. This shift is partially attributable to more severe accidents. This shift to larger and more complex cases has also resulted in greater variability in paid and case reserve development patterns. As part of our actuarial process, we review changes in claim development patterns to define an appropriate range of estimated outcomes based on weighing historical and more recent trends in the data. The chart on the right side depicts the value of two standard deviations to the average paid in case severity development over the last six report years. As you can see, this measure of variability has almost doubled over the last two years, resulting in a wider range of estimated outcomes. The third quarter reserving process showed a continuation of these development patterns. Therefore, we increased reserves for prior years to reflect the persistence of the trends in major injuries, increased settlement costs and greater variability in case reserves. We're proactively responding to these trends by leveraging sophisticated models, increasing medical expertise, reviewing settlement processes and assessing litigation risks. Now let's move to Slide 13 and briefly discuss physical damage loss costs, which continue to pressure profitability. Rising inflation and delays in third-party carriers subrogation demands are driving higher expected severity in the property damage coverage leading to an increase in the current year -- the current report year variance from 12% to 17% when compared to 2021. The left side of the slide includes a chart we have shown before, which indexes inflation to year-end 2018 for a few of the main inputs to physical damage severity. While used car values are below their recent peak, which is a positive indicator to continue to run more than 50% above pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, labor and parts prices continue to accelerate from the prior peak levels seen just last quarter. This continues to put upward pressure on severities in the near term. The right-hand side of the page shows third-party subrogation demand dollars paid, again, indexed to the year-end 2018. Third-party demands are when our insured isn't an accident and the claimant files a claim to their carrier rather than us. As the other carrier evaluates the claim, the Allstate insured is wholly or partially at fault, they will reach out to us with subrogation demand. We have recently experienced an uptick in the volume of severity -- volume and severity of these demands compared to prior year trends and expectations. It's worth noting that a similar dynamic is also impacting our first-party collision coverages. We are demanding and receiving elevated subrogation collections from other carriers following the declines during the pandemic and backlog and claim settlements due to delayed repairs. Shifting gears now on Slide 14. The Protection Services businesses in the lower strategic growing revenues and increasing shareholder value as we invest in future expansion. Revenues, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives increased 7.2% to $640 million in the quarter, primarily driven by a 12.2% increase in Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $35 million for the third quarter of 2022 decreased $10 million compared to the prior year quarter due to increased severity on appliance repair for Allstate protection plans, in the absence of onetime restructuring expense at Allstate Identity Protection in the prior year quarter as well as investments in growth. Policies in force declined 5%, reflecting the expiration of protection plan warranties primarily due to the -- to a high volume, low premium per policy retail account and overall decline in retail sales. Moving now to Slide 15. Allstate Health and Benefits is also growing an attractive set of businesses that protect millions of policyholders. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual health products to our portfolio, as you can see on the left. Revenues of $570 million in the third quarter of 2022 increased 1.2% to the prior year quarter as growth in group health and employer voluntary benefits was partially offset by a reduction in individual health. Adjusted net income of $54 million increased $21 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting a lower benefit ratio, lower restructuring charges and increased revenue. Shifting now to investments on Slide 16. We'll review the performance and the portfolio risk and return position that we've taken given higher inflation and the possibility of a recession. As you may recall, we reduced our portfolio risk beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021. This included shortening the fixed income duration from 4.6 years to three years through the sale of bonds and use of derivatives, which resulted in a reduction to the portfolio's sensitivity to higher interest rates caused by increasing inflation. We also reduced our exposure to recession-sensitive assets through the sales of high-yield bonds, bank loans and public equity. We maintained this defensive positioning in the third quarter, which continued to preserve portfolio value given ongoing market volatility, rising interest rates and a further decline in public equity markets. As shown in the table, at the bottom left, our total return for the quarter was negative 0.8% and year-to-date is negative 6.4%, while adverse market conditions negatively impacted the portfolio, we estimate our duration shortening mitigated portfolio losses of approximately $2 billion. These proactive actions and the broad diversification of our portfolio produced results that were better than the S&P 500 index which is down 23.9% this year and the Bloomberg Intermediate corporate bond index, which has declined 11.8%. Our net investment income, shown in the chart on the left, totaled $690 million in the quarter, which was $74 million below the third quarter of last year. Performance-based income of $335 million shown in dark blue, was $102 million below a strong quarter in 2021. Three individual investments generated approximately 97% of the performance-based investment income in the quarter, including two sizable cash realizations. Excluding those assets, results of the broader performance-based portfolio were largely flat with negative valuations in our private equity fund investments, which have a higher correlation to public equity markets, offset by increased valuations on other asset classes such as real estate and infrastructure. Our market-based income, which is shown in blue, was $50 million above the prior year quarter, benefiting from reinvestment into market yields that are significantly higher than the overall portfolio's current yield. The table on the right demonstrates how our shorter duration fixed income portfolio is positioned to generate higher levels of investment income as we reinvest into higher interest rates. Our fixed income yield has begun to rise and was 2.9% at quarter end, but is well below the current intermediate corporate bond yield of 5.6%. Now let's take a few minutes to discuss Allstate's financial condition and capital position, starting with Slide 17. Allstate's corporate organizational structure provides sources of capital to the holding company from multiple reporting entities and intermediate holding companies. We manage capital at all levels using economic capital, rating agency models and regulatory requirements to guide decisions and maximize flexibility. We commonly report a view of capital that includes both statutory surplus and parent company -- parent holding company assets. We prefer to dividend money up from subsidiaries to the holding company when possible as it provides more financial flexibility for the organization while maintaining adequate capital levels from subsidiaries to support operations. The chart on the left shows an overview of our capital position since 2016. As you can see, it grew substantially beginning in 2019 following strong results leading up to and during the pandemic. While the current level of $19.8 billion is approximately $6 billion lower than a year ago, this was largely made up of two specific items. First, $3 billion or roughly half is related to the sale of the Life and Annuity business, as represented by the first red bar on the chart. This transaction reduced our statutory capital as we sold the legal entities and significantly reduced our overall risk profile, freeing up an additional $1.7 billion of capital. We returned this capital to shareholders as part of the current $5 billion share repurchase authorization. The second bar reflects our cash returns to shareholders, excluding the impact of the life and annuity sale. Together, these factors reduced capital by $5.4 billion with more than $4 billion going back to shareholders. The last red bar primarily reflects the impact of current auto insurance profitability challenges, which have resulted in a statutory loss and then changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity investments due to recent market volatility. We also added a line to this chart that represents our average capital from year-end 2016 through Q3 of 2021, excluding surplus related to the life and annuity businesses. Our current capital position of $19.8 billion is approximately $1 billion higher than this average, demonstrating that returning cash to shareholders after adjusting our risk profile in recent years of profitability has left us in a strong capital position. The right-hand side of this page isolates holding company assets, a key component of our capital relative to the remaining authorized repurchases and fixed charges. At the end of the third quarter, we had $4.5 billion in holding company assets with $1.2 billion remaining on the current share repurchase authorization, we would still have $3.3 billion remaining in comparison to our annual fixed charges of $1.3 billion. We believe holding company assets and capital resources available from statutory operating companies provide significant financial flexibility as we continue to implement profit improvement actions and invest in transformative growth. Now let's move to Slide 18 to discuss Allstate's strong cash return to shareholders. Adjusted net income return on equity of 4.3% was below the prior year, primarily due to lower underwriting income. Achieving our targeted combined ratios for auto and homeowners insurance will bring adjusted net income returns on equity back to our long-term targeted range of 14% to 17%. Through the first three quarters of 2022, we've returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through $2.1 billion in share repurchases and $698 million in common shareholder dividends. Over the last year, shares outstanding have been reduced by 7.7%, providing more upside per share as profitability has improved. There's $1.2 billion remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase authorization as of September 30, which we expect to be completed in the second or third quarter of 2023 and as we moderately slow the pace of our repurchases. With that context, we're going to open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond.\nCharles Peters: I'm going to focus the first question on reserves. And I was looking at the information you provided on Slide 12 and some of the earlier slides. And I guess what we're trying to do is reconcile the charge that you took in the third quarter with the information we're getting from some of your peers? And then additionally, trying to understand why the data that you're showing now here for the third quarter results, so you can start to see it in the second quarter and make adjustments then. And I mean it's a long-winded question, but ultimately, we're trying to get at is there a risk of additional reserve charges going forward?\nThomas Wilson: Greg, thank you for your question. Let me provide just a quick overview, and then Jesse can give you some more specifics. First, of course, obviously, we estimate the what's going to happen that depends on trends for the numbers. And we can't make a comment as to what other people's numbers look. People do reserving all sorts of different ways. And we believe ours is highly precise, specific, and we have external people look at it, and we put up the numbers when we think we need to put them up. And of course, this quarter, we did increase it for prior years and that's largely due to the injury trends that just saw, which have really been unfolding over the last couple of years. And these are claims that take 4 years before you get 80% paid. It takes a while before it developed. Jesse what would -- how do you want to address that?\nJess Merten: Yes. Thanks, Tom. Greg, what I would start with is, I think it's important to be clear on one thing. At the end of every quarter, we record reserves at an appropriate level based on all the information that we have in front of us. We did that at the end of Q3 and every quarter leading up to Q3. We followed the same process that we have in the past. It's a rigorous process. It leverages internal actuarial expertise, close collaboration with our claims team and third-party reviews to analyze the most current data and assess the impact on that data on our reserves. . As I look at the quarter, the variability that we've seen continue to come through in the data that we reviewed as part of our actual process. So Q3 data supported more recent trends and continued variability in reserve development. And while these trends weren't new, an additional quarter of data did provide new insights into the persistent nature of the trends that have been emerging. So insights from actual claims development in the quarter, led us to strengthen both prior year reserves and increase our report year 2022 ultimate severities. So as I take a step back and think about where we're at from a reserve perspective, we record appropriate reserves based on what we know at the time. We used current data and all known factors to establish the reserves. So I'm confident in what we set up. And I think that the new insights that we cleaned in Q3 caused us to make the move.\nCharles Peters: Okay, makes sense. I guess my follow-up question is on capital. And just looking at it from a macro perspective, I really don't remember in recent history, a time where you guys have been growing your top line almost at a double-digit rate. And that by itself puts pressure on capital resources. And then if we look at your capital position outlined in the statistical supplement, and we see total capital resources having declined year-over-year due to a variety of issues. Just wondering if you can help frame how we should think about traditional metrics around premiums to surplus in the context of all the different moving parts?\nThomas Wilson: I'll start and then Jesse can add as well. So Greg, first, we don't use the traditional -- when we look at the traditional metrics like premium surplus and as we go, but we're much more sophisticated than that. And it goes -- in the way we allocate capital is from an enterprise standpoint and looks at specificity on risk levels down to the state-based level by line. So for example, some people would blend their premium to surplus ratio for all property liability products, auto and home at the same. We don't do that. We think capital is much higher for homeowners insurance. And that's why when Mario went through our target ratios for home insurance, they're lower than they are for auto insurance. Other people just assume that same. So we're much -- we're very sophisticated in the way we do it. We manage it from an enterprise standpoint. So when we -- the answer would be we have plenty of capital, like we've got tons of money, and it's not going to do anything to our strategy. It has no impact on our future earnings power, which is, of course, what drives the company. And we're in the middle of a massive share repurchase program, and we don't feel like we have to back off on it based on what we know about our business at the granular level. So we feel very good about where we're at. We've generated good returns for shareholders by doing it that way. And so there's really -- I feel like using broad measures like that doesn't really reflect the economic reality that we're managing to. Jesse, where would you go from there?\nJess Merten: That's a pretty complete answer, Tom. But I think the important point is that the proactive capital management that really relies on our robust economic capital approach, which looks at risk on a granular basis and takes that information to understand capital needs in an enterprise level. Premium surplus only looks at one dimension of risk and capital, and we use a more complete set of measures and metrics to establish capital levels, as Tom laid out. So I just think it's important. We're cognizant of and we monitor regulatory capital requirements, rating agency capital benchmarks, all in our proactive capital management process. But I feel the same way that Tom does it that we certainly have plenty of money to execute on our strategies and continue to implement our profit improvement plan. So nothing more to add, Tom.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the capital side of things. So as you guys came to the decision, I guess, to more moderate your buyback, are you assuming that there's any dividends that you're going to take out of Allstate Insurance company over the next year? And then within that question, I guess, did you guys think about pausing the buyback program completely just to have more capital flexibility within that subsidiary?\nThomas Wilson: Elyse, let me answer that and Jesse can jump in. First, in terms of the dividends, we move -- first, we make sure that each of the insurance subsidiaries that large ones are appropriately capitalized based on what we think economic capital is just that with the rating agencies, whether it's an investor, others, think we should have in those and then what regulators want. So -- and we're really well capitalized at those. To the extent there is extra capital in those, we then move that out of the insurance companies into the holding company is just point out because that gives us more flexibility. As we look forward next year, it will depend how much money we make. I think in some of the announcements, like we have really strong earnings power and when you look at our profitability of our auto insurance, we think it's headed up. So we think there's plenty of earnings power. Whether that and where we think risk is and what we need to do with risk will depend on the overall enterprise risk portfolio. So for example, not covered in some of these things, we dialled down the risk for our investment portfolio late last year as a percentage of our total enterprise capital because we didn't think it was a good risk return trade-off. So we're constantly managing where do we want to move capital where do we want to make sure we get a good return on it. So we don't feel like we are capital constrained at all. Did we consider shutting the program down in total? No. We think we have plenty of moments of $5 billion of massive share repurchase program, a large 4 of which a portion of which was funded because we sold the life insurance company. and we said we should get that money back to the cat shareholders. So we have a historical track record of doing this extremely well. We're a top decile amongst the S&P of providing cash returns to shareholders. And we do that without putting our customers at risk of the company is. So we feel like we're in really good shape.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my follow-up, I guess, would be right. You talked about that you don't manage your premium to surplus, but I know one of your peers has mentioned looking to write their all business to a 3:1 home to 1.5:1. So I'm not sure if you have frames of references that you look at for your businesses? And then if rating agencies and regulators, what are they looking at? Are they holding you to a 3:1? Or is there other metrics that they're holding you to relative to premium to surplus or something else?\nThomas Wilson: We've had -- essentially to say, from certainly my standpoint, no conversations with regulators about our cap levels because we're so well capitalized -- I might start there. And that's been true forever and it will be true far into the future. And so the regulators really were so far above their standards. It's not really been a conversation. I can't speak to how other people look at their premium surplus ratio. I think some of our competitors who don't make money in homeowners should have even more than we do. Because when you look at your capital it's -- okay, what do we think the risk is? What is the risk of loss. But you also want to factor in your earnings power. And so if you're losing $0.10 on a dollar, on a line of business, then you have to hold more capital than if you're making $0.10 on the line of business. So I think it's all very idiosyncratic to a specific company. . We factor all of those things in by state really and even sometimes looking down at different components of the state to decide what price we should get per customer from customers, how much business we want to write and then how much capital we have to keep in the company. So I feel very good about where we're at.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS.\nBrian Meredith: A couple of them here for you. First, Tom, I'm just curious, this is the, I think, first quarter a little while that we've seen auto PIF actually declined somewhat sequentially. Is that due to some of the actions you're taking in California? Or is it just in general, the price increases you're taking should we expect the PIFs to kind of decline here for a couple of quarters.\nThomas Wilson: Well, the PIF decline was, of course, in the Allstate brand versus in total because we went up in the independent agent channel, but it's intentional. And I would tell you that it's actually the decline was less than we thought it would be. When you look at historical price sensitivities on what your customer retention is, our retention is held up better than you would think from historical trends. It's hard to do attribution down to the specific item, but when you look at it, we'd say, first, the competitive position -- our competitors are also raising rates. So as we raise rates, we thought more people would leave, but less did. It could be because our competitors are also raising rates. Consumers still have a fair amount of cash in their bank accounts, so that helps. They also know that their houses and cars are worth more. So it makes sense to them that they should have to pay more for insurance, when explained to them. And I think that's the value of our Allstate agents at this point. they're out working hard to make sure our customers understand why the prices are going up. And then as Mario mentioned, they'll help them work to figure out how do they get the right price. So this is a case where like our mile-wise product is really helpful for people because if you're, say your senior citizen, you don't drive much and you should go to Milewise and save a bunch of money by not paying more. So when you look through all those together, we expected our auto PIF to go down more in the Allstate brand than it did. But we're happy that we're keeping the customers because with the price increases we've put through that will be good shareholder value creation when we start earning the rates.\nBrian Meredith: Great. That's helpful. And then my next question, I'm just curious, and I think this question will be asked in prior quarters, but when you're pricing your auto insurance and homeowners insurance now, what type of loss trend are you expecting in the future expecting inflationary trends to moderate here? Or do you think they're going to stay relatively high here for a while?\nThomas Wilson: Mario, will you take that?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, sure. Brian. Yes, I think, Brian, in terms of what we're seeing, we're factoring in, obviously, the inflation we're experiencing currently, but also projecting it going forward so that we can reflect the full cost of loss costs prospectively into our prices. And so yes, we're not making any kind of significant assumptions around a deceleration in inflation going forward given the current inflationary environment, that's why we made the statement that we expect to continue to take rate increases certainly for the balance of this year but into next year, and that's really a reflection of the environment we're operating right now and the continued elevated level of inflation, which we need to kind of catch up with and then surpass going forward. So we're not assuming, as I said, any significant reduction in inflationary trends going forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: All right. So used ask this question for casualty line writers. Given the consecutive adverse reserve development charges, have you worked with any external actuaries to review reserves? And if so, what is your management estimate relative to central estimates?\nThomas Wilson: Tracy, we always work with external people and looking at our reserves. So we obviously have Deloitte & Touche to our auditors, but we also have an external actuary in called -- which is KPMG, which provides the statutory reports for our regulators. We look at all of their stuff. We just had a detailed review with Deloitte & Touche a couple of weeks ago, and their view ties closely to ours. .\nTracy Benguigui: Do you have a management estimate above the central estimate at the moment? Or is it closer to the central?\nThomas Wilson: We don't put ranges in the financials. We put up what we -- as Jesse said, like we put up what we think the future liability is and we pick a number, and that's where we do it. And we're comfortable with the number and that number is very close to what our external participants or external health thinks and thought historically, by the way. So it isn't like we were in -- we built a very similar views at the end of the second quarter, end of the first quarter and end of the third quarter, and they are -- they believe that the actions we've taken are appropriate.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. And just going back to capital management, given you manage capital more efficiently at the OpCo level and the way you like to hold cash at the holdco level if you could flex that up and down. I'm just curious, when was the last time you downstream capital to the operating company. How do you lever often.\nThomas Wilson: It's a good question. I don't remember certainly in the last decade, I don't remember having done that at all from -- down to the Allstate insurance company. Would we move money into the health and benefits companies because they were growing or do we have to -- so we do move money around. But if you said if you really talk about Allstate insurance company as the largest business we have, I don't remember anything in the last 10 years. But Jesse or Mario, do you have any other perspective on that?\nJess Merten: I don't have anything more than that. I think we did move some capital down into the Life company. at 1 point, Tom. But I think that certainly is no longer an issue, but that's the last thing that I remember. Mario? .\nMario Rizzo: Yes, I would concur the last time I remember any meaningful movement of capital down into an operating company. would have been during the financial crisis, which obviously was a while ago. But as Tom mentioned, we moved capital around but nothing in terms of shortfalls within any of the insurance companies.\nTracy Benguigui: Right. but I'm not thinking about this the right way where you have capital at the parent company that you could flex it up and down in your slide when you talk about your fixed charges, is there a multiple that you want to keep like 2x minimum level?\nThomas Wilson: We don't manage it that way. I just showed the level of cash we would have after we used deployable capital to finish the share repurchase program, you can see it's still well above our fixed charges, which we intentionally managed to keep at a modest level, which is even though we increased the dividend by about 50% a year ago, we tried to give a lot of money back to shareholders through share repurchases. So we don't have a multiple -- if you had a multiple and you also have to factor in how much money you're going to make over the next 12 months. And obviously, our fixed charge coverages historically have been terrific. So we don't have a -- like don't go below this because we've never even been close.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: I think it was Jesse, who spoke about just the mix shift that you're experiencing on the BI claims side to more expensive claims. And as part of the reserving process, you weight both historical and more recent trends in the claim development patterns in the data. So I guess I'm wondering after the changes that you've made this quarter, are you -- I guess, how much are you waiting more recent experience? Is it 100% weight on these trends that you're seeing? Or is there still some weight being placed on more historical experience?\nThomas Wilson: David, let me answer that, and Jesse, you can add anything else to it. So first, the reserving process uses all types of statistical analysis, triangles, link ratios, all sorts of different things. So there's no real like just 1 percentage. I think we look at it by state, by line of business, by coverage. And so it's slice and dice a whole bunch of way. So there's no really simple way to answer that. I think what I would say about you're trying to get comfortable with the reserves. It really starts -- you got to go back to say, well, what's happening in the world. And during the pandemic, we noticed when people weren't on the roads, people were driving a lot faster because there is -- they could zip around and there was no traffic and off they went. Once we get through the pandemic, at least in our data, we see people still driving pretty fast, but as a result of that, you have more severe accidents, and that trend appears to be holding. We thought that, that trend might come down because when the little ones are sort of bumps in scratches and stuff, which happen in congested traffic. Today, those, as you saw from Jesse's numbers have not gone back up and the major ones have not gone down. So people are just driving faster and hurting people more. So you have to figure out, okay, well, what are you going to do take care of it. Those are really complicated cases. I mean people have surgery, they have all kinds of services, and those services are more expensive, and they take longer to develop. So if you really severely injured, it could take 6 months, nine months, two years before you really figure out how you get back to where you should be, and it costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time. And so those cases develop over a longer period of time. So it isn't so much that it's just -- we use the same process as procedures, but as these things develop, it really comes back to -- our customers are just in a lot more severe actions and people are getting hurt, and we need to make sure we have the liability up to cover that. And that's what we did this quarter. So we said, okay, this is really continuing. Most of these are still severe. And as they develop, then you have to put the money up.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. So it sounds like you had assumed that the mix which normalize somewhat away from some of these more severe accidents, and I guess now the assumption is that there is going to be no mix away from these more severe accidents and that's sort of the new normal. Is that correct?\nThomas Wilson: Yes. But it's not just 1 item, I would say. So you can't pin it on just those now more majors. There's more majors. The majors are harder to estimate. They're taking longer to settle. There's more legal costs associated with settling those, and so you have to factor that in. So there's a whole bunch of factors that relate to it. So we look at it. We're comfortable we've put up the right amount of money. And what other companies do and what they're reserving are -- some people use less specific processes that we do, some processes react faster or slower to trends in the marketplace. But the important thing is we use the same process is have external views, and we all think this is the right amount of money.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a quick numbers follow-up here. So see that you guys are now assuming a bodily injury severity of 12%, I guess I'm just wondering what was the report year incurred severity on bodily injury for 2021 after the changes that you've made?\nThomas Wilson: We have not broken out the reserve -- after the reserve changes by prior years. We won't break those out until we publish the 10-K. I mean, is that right -- correct, Jess?\nJess Merten: That's right, Tom. We don't disclose the split, so we don't have that.\nThomas Wilson: But suffice it to say, David, that is higher than it was before.\nDavid Motemaden: Yes. I was looking at a -- I'm just trying to get a sense for the compound if we say, okay, up 12%, but the base does matter. And so I think the base was set at 5% in the first quarter for all of 2021, which has since been changed. So I was just trying to get a sense for where that's gone. But I guess I'll look in the K for that.\nThomas Wilson: Why don't we take 1 more question and then...\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: I'm going to go to my specialty of beating dead horses here, if I can. On capital, do you expect to deploy some of the hold liquidity into AIC over the coming year?\nThomas Wilson: No.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then shifting more just to the auto and home side. So I think you guys shifted the exclusive agent comp structure to be more weighted to new business. Now that you're kind of maybe taking a little bit of a step back on growth and really focusing more on fixing the margins, how is that playing out with the agent comp structure with your conversations with them? I'm assuming that can be a little bit of murmurings and rumblings around that. How are you handling that?\nThomas Wilson: Well, I'm address embedded in all of this, there's a lot of good news on transformative growth that we really don't have a chance to talk about it. One is that which you talked about, which was expanding customer access is the second key lever. And that included selling direct under the Allstate brand at 7% less than it was sold through Allstate agents. And there was some concern amongst investors as to would the agents walk away and would you have a decline in volume there? And the answer is no. That is the underlying assumption that they would continue to be focused on getting more new customers given what we did to the compensation plan was true. . If you look at new business from the Allstate agents, you can see that's where it was a year ago, even though there are fewer Allstate agents out there. And then if you look at the retention numbers, as I mentioned, I think our agents are doing a great job for us talking to customers whose price changes. And so we feel good that, that part of the expanding access, all of our underlying assumptions prove to. We also have really improved our web-based and the call center close processes. So we're getting much better at selling through those two vehicles. We obviously dialled the advertising way down this year because we don't want to take on new business and then have to raise the price 15% or 20% the first time. So while you don't see the benefit of those improved processes come through new business, but when we get auto profitability improved, we feel good about the underlying assumptions we made in transformative growth and our progress in making those realities. So we're feeling good about where that's headed.\nThomas Wilson: So thank you all for dialing in. As we move forward, we have a couple of things in front of us. One, we have to improve auto insurance margins, while making sure we continue to invest and transform the growth so that we can grow market share and then continuing to expand our other protection services businesses, which also had a great quarter. So thank you and we will talk to you in December.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect at today's conference.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Wilson",
            "content": "Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time with Allstate today. As you know, we pre-released earnings several weeks ago and reported the net loss for the quarter. That reflected a small underlying, underwriting margin that was offset by increases in reserves for prior years and a mark-to-market loss on public equity securities. . Mario and Jeff will go through the details of the quarter and the reserve changes after I set some context. So let's start on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy to increase shareholder value has two components: increase personal profit liability market share and expand protection services, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. We're building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution through transfer onto growth to increase market share. We're also broadening protection offerings and leveraging the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities with expanded distribution. In the third quarter, we made progress executing this strategy, while we continue to implement a comprehensive approach to improve auto profitability, which is shown in the right-hand panel, that includes broadly raising auto insurance rates, which you've seen in our disclosures. Operating expenses were lowered, including advertising and more permanent reductions in the operating cost structure. Underwriting guidelines have been adjusted to reduce new business volume where we're not earning adequate returns. Our claims operating processes are being modified to manage loss cost in a high inflation environment. And we believe this plan will return auto insurance profitability to historical levels. While the current environment requires focus on improving margins, we continue to advance and transform our growth strategy to gain market share when profitability improves. In addition, the protection services businesses is generating profitable growth. Investment returns were negative for the quarter and year-to-date, but better than the overall declines in the bond and equity markets. This reflects risk reductions implemented late last year. So you'll remember, we reduced the bond portfolio duration to lower exposure to high interest rates, which enabled us to avoid about $2 billion in losses in the bond portfolio. Our capital position is strong, and as a result, we were able to deliver attractive returns to shareholders. And Jess is going to discuss capital in his section, but let me provide a few summary points since this was covered in some of the reports issued last night. First, we have plenty of capital, and there's $4.5 billion of deployable capital at the holding. Secondly, the significant reduction in risk with the sale of the life and annuity operations occurred last October and that needs to be considered. This divestiture reduced assets by $34 billion and freed up capital. Thirdly, we use a really sophisticated approach to determining our capital that goes far beyond statutory capital and premium to surplus ratios. For example, if you just use statutory capital measure, the life company equity would be included in capital historically, which we did not believe was appropriate, so we never included it. So our methodology has led to strong results. We did decide to complete the remaining $1.4 billion stock repurchase over more than the next six months, which was our prior target we had disclosed to, but we still expect to complete it in the second or third quarter of next year. So in summary, we're really well capitalized, and this year's results have not changed our strategy or earnings power. Now let's move to Slide 3 to go through the third quarter performance in detail. Total revenues of $13.2 billion or 5.8% over the prior year quarter as property liability premiums earned increased by $5 billion or 9.8%, which reflected higher average premiums and policy growth. Lower net investment income and net losses on investments and derivatives negatively impacted the year-over-year considering our comparison there. A net loss of $694 million and an adjusted net loss of $420 million in the third quarter reflected a decline in underwriting income due to an increase in profit liability, prior year reserve estimates, which was $875 million that excludes catastrophes and increased loss costs in the current year. Looking forward, beyond improving profits in auto insurance, if you go to Slide 4, you'll see the flywheel of growth that will increase personal profit liability market share. So this is a multiyear initiative designed to build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution, that will be accomplished by delivering on five key objectives: improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, deploying new technology ecosystems and enhancing organizational capabilities. We made significant progress on all these components, and we're well on the way to having really being in a position where we can dial up growth quite rapidly when profitability improves. Now let me turn it over to Mario, and he'll go through our property-liability results. Greg, thank you for your question. Let me provide just a quick overview, and then Jesse can give you some more specifics. First, of course, obviously, we estimate the what's going to happen that depends on trends for the numbers. And we can't make a comment as to what other people's numbers look. People do reserving all sorts of different ways. And we believe ours is highly precise, specific, and we have external people look at it, and we put up the numbers when we think we need to put them up. And of course, this quarter, we did increase it for prior years and that's largely due to the injury trends that just saw, which have really been unfolding over the last couple of years. And these are claims that take 4 years before you get 80% paid. It takes a while before it developed. Jesse what would -- how do you want to address that? I'll start and then Jesse can add as well. So Greg, first, we don't use the traditional -- when we look at the traditional metrics like premium surplus and as we go, but we're much more sophisticated than that. And it goes -- in the way we allocate capital is from an enterprise standpoint and looks at specificity on risk levels down to the state-based level by line. So for example, some people would blend their premium to surplus ratio for all property liability products, auto and home at the same. We don't do that. We think capital is much higher for homeowners insurance. And that's why when Mario went through our target ratios for home insurance, they're lower than they are for auto insurance. Other people just assume that same. So we're much -- we're very sophisticated in the way we do it. We manage it from an enterprise standpoint. So when we -- the answer would be we have plenty of capital, like we've got tons of money, and it's not going to do anything to our strategy. It has no impact on our future earnings power, which is, of course, what drives the company. And we're in the middle of a massive share repurchase program, and we don't feel like we have to back off on it based on what we know about our business at the granular level. So we feel very good about where we're at. We've generated good returns for shareholders by doing it that way. And so there's really -- I feel like using broad measures like that doesn't really reflect the economic reality that we're managing to. Jesse, where would you go from there? Elyse, let me answer that and Jesse can jump in. First, in terms of the dividends, we move -- first, we make sure that each of the insurance subsidiaries that large ones are appropriately capitalized based on what we think economic capital is just that with the rating agencies, whether it's an investor, others, think we should have in those and then what regulators want. So -- and we're really well capitalized at those. To the extent there is extra capital in those, we then move that out of the insurance companies into the holding company is just point out because that gives us more flexibility. As we look forward next year, it will depend how much money we make. I think in some of the announcements, like we have really strong earnings power and when you look at our profitability of our auto insurance, we think it's headed up. So we think there's plenty of earnings power. Whether that and where we think risk is and what we need to do with risk will depend on the overall enterprise risk portfolio. So for example, not covered in some of these things, we dialled down the risk for our investment portfolio late last year as a percentage of our total enterprise capital because we didn't think it was a good risk return trade-off. So we're constantly managing where do we want to move capital where do we want to make sure we get a good return on it. So we don't feel like we are capital constrained at all. Did we consider shutting the program down in total? No. We think we have plenty of moments of $5 billion of massive share repurchase program, a large 4 of which a portion of which was funded because we sold the life insurance company. and we said we should get that money back to the cat shareholders. So we have a historical track record of doing this extremely well. We're a top decile amongst the S&P of providing cash returns to shareholders. And we do that without putting our customers at risk of the company is. So we feel like we're in really good shape. We've had -- essentially to say, from certainly my standpoint, no conversations with regulators about our cap levels because we're so well capitalized -- I might start there. And that's been true forever and it will be true far into the future. And so the regulators really were so far above their standards. It's not really been a conversation. I can't speak to how other people look at their premium surplus ratio. I think some of our competitors who don't make money in homeowners should have even more than we do. Because when you look at your capital it's -- okay, what do we think the risk is? What is the risk of loss. But you also want to factor in your earnings power. And so if you're losing $0.10 on a dollar, on a line of business, then you have to hold more capital than if you're making $0.10 on the line of business. So I think it's all very idiosyncratic to a specific company. . We factor all of those things in by state really and even sometimes looking down at different components of the state to decide what price we should get per customer from customers, how much business we want to write and then how much capital we have to keep in the company. So I feel very good about where we're at. Well, the PIF decline was, of course, in the Allstate brand versus in total because we went up in the independent agent channel, but it's intentional. And I would tell you that it's actually the decline was less than we thought it would be. When you look at historical price sensitivities on what your customer retention is, our retention is held up better than you would think from historical trends. It's hard to do attribution down to the specific item, but when you look at it, we'd say, first, the competitive position -- our competitors are also raising rates. So as we raise rates, we thought more people would leave, but less did. It could be because our competitors are also raising rates. Consumers still have a fair amount of cash in their bank accounts, so that helps. They also know that their houses and cars are worth more. So it makes sense to them that they should have to pay more for insurance, when explained to them. And I think that's the value of our Allstate agents at this point. they're out working hard to make sure our customers understand why the prices are going up. And then as Mario mentioned, they'll help them work to figure out how do they get the right price. So this is a case where like our mile-wise product is really helpful for people because if you're, say your senior citizen, you don't drive much and you should go to Milewise and save a bunch of money by not paying more. So when you look through all those together, we expected our auto PIF to go down more in the Allstate brand than it did. But we're happy that we're keeping the customers because with the price increases we've put through that will be good shareholder value creation when we start earning the rates. Mario, will you take that? Tracy, we always work with external people and looking at our reserves. So we obviously have Deloitte & Touche to our auditors, but we also have an external actuary in called -- which is KPMG, which provides the statutory reports for our regulators. We look at all of their stuff. We just had a detailed review with Deloitte & Touche a couple of weeks ago, and their view ties closely to ours. . We don't put ranges in the financials. We put up what we -- as Jesse said, like we put up what we think the future liability is and we pick a number, and that's where we do it. And we're comfortable with the number and that number is very close to what our external participants or external health thinks and thought historically, by the way. So it isn't like we were in -- we built a very similar views at the end of the second quarter, end of the first quarter and end of the third quarter, and they are -- they believe that the actions we've taken are appropriate. It's a good question. I don't remember certainly in the last decade, I don't remember having done that at all from -- down to the Allstate insurance company. Would we move money into the health and benefits companies because they were growing or do we have to -- so we do move money around. But if you said if you really talk about Allstate insurance company as the largest business we have, I don't remember anything in the last 10 years. But Jesse or Mario, do you have any other perspective on that? We don't manage it that way. I just showed the level of cash we would have after we used deployable capital to finish the share repurchase program, you can see it's still well above our fixed charges, which we intentionally managed to keep at a modest level, which is even though we increased the dividend by about 50% a year ago, we tried to give a lot of money back to shareholders through share repurchases. So we don't have a multiple -- if you had a multiple and you also have to factor in how much money you're going to make over the next 12 months. And obviously, our fixed charge coverages historically have been terrific. So we don't have a -- like don't go below this because we've never even been close. David, let me answer that, and Jesse, you can add anything else to it. So first, the reserving process uses all types of statistical analysis, triangles, link ratios, all sorts of different things. So there's no real like just 1 percentage. I think we look at it by state, by line of business, by coverage. And so it's slice and dice a whole bunch of way. So there's no really simple way to answer that. I think what I would say about you're trying to get comfortable with the reserves. It really starts -- you got to go back to say, well, what's happening in the world. And during the pandemic, we noticed when people weren't on the roads, people were driving a lot faster because there is -- they could zip around and there was no traffic and off they went. Once we get through the pandemic, at least in our data, we see people still driving pretty fast, but as a result of that, you have more severe accidents, and that trend appears to be holding. We thought that, that trend might come down because when the little ones are sort of bumps in scratches and stuff, which happen in congested traffic. Today, those, as you saw from Jesse's numbers have not gone back up and the major ones have not gone down. So people are just driving faster and hurting people more. So you have to figure out, okay, well, what are you going to do take care of it. Those are really complicated cases. I mean people have surgery, they have all kinds of services, and those services are more expensive, and they take longer to develop. So if you really severely injured, it could take 6 months, nine months, two years before you really figure out how you get back to where you should be, and it costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time. And so those cases develop over a longer period of time. So it isn't so much that it's just -- we use the same process as procedures, but as these things develop, it really comes back to -- our customers are just in a lot more severe actions and people are getting hurt, and we need to make sure we have the liability up to cover that. And that's what we did this quarter. So we said, okay, this is really continuing. Most of these are still severe. And as they develop, then you have to put the money up. Yes. But it's not just 1 item, I would say. So you can't pin it on just those now more majors. There's more majors. The majors are harder to estimate. They're taking longer to settle. There's more legal costs associated with settling those, and so you have to factor that in. So there's a whole bunch of factors that relate to it. So we look at it. We're comfortable we've put up the right amount of money. And what other companies do and what they're reserving are -- some people use less specific processes that we do, some processes react faster or slower to trends in the marketplace. But the important thing is we use the same process is have external views, and we all think this is the right amount of money. We have not broken out the reserve -- after the reserve changes by prior years. We won't break those out until we publish the 10-K. I mean, is that right -- correct, Jess? But suffice it to say, David, that is higher than it was before. Why don't we take 1 more question and then... No. Well, I'm address embedded in all of this, there's a lot of good news on transformative growth that we really don't have a chance to talk about it. One is that which you talked about, which was expanding customer access is the second key lever. And that included selling direct under the Allstate brand at 7% less than it was sold through Allstate agents. And there was some concern amongst investors as to would the agents walk away and would you have a decline in volume there? And the answer is no. That is the underlying assumption that they would continue to be focused on getting more new customers given what we did to the compensation plan was true. . If you look at new business from the Allstate agents, you can see that's where it was a year ago, even though there are fewer Allstate agents out there. And then if you look at the retention numbers, as I mentioned, I think our agents are doing a great job for us talking to customers whose price changes. And so we feel good that, that part of the expanding access, all of our underlying assumptions prove to. We also have really improved our web-based and the call center close processes. So we're getting much better at selling through those two vehicles. We obviously dialled the advertising way down this year because we don't want to take on new business and then have to raise the price 15% or 20% the first time. So while you don't see the benefit of those improved processes come through new business, but when we get auto profitability improved, we feel good about the underlying assumptions we made in transformative growth and our progress in making those realities. So we're feeling good about where that's headed. So thank you all for dialing in. As we move forward, we have a couple of things in front of us. One, we have to improve auto insurance margins, while making sure we continue to invest and transform the growth so that we can grow market share and then continuing to expand our other protection services businesses, which also had a great quarter. So thank you and we will talk to you in December."

            "name": "Jess Merten",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 11, let's begin with our prior year reserve development, property liability, prior year reserve strengthening, excluding catastrophes totaled $875 million in the third quarter. The pie chart on the left breaks down the impact by line with $643 million, driven by personal auto, $120 million one-off property liability from our annual reserve review related to environmental and asbestos exposures, $63 million in commercial, largely related to auto bodily injury and $51 million in homeowners. . The chart on the right breaks down Allstate Protection auto prior year reserve strengthening of $643 million in the third quarter, which was primarily driven by noncustomer claim and bodily injury claims. The total cost to settle these claims continues to be impacted by more severe accidents and higher medical and litigation costs. Increases to commercial and homeowners insurance can also be attributed to these factors. Physical damage prior year reserve increases in the third quarter from property damage collision and comprehensive coverages, excluding catastrophes, were largely offset by higher subrogation collection estimates. Now let's move to Slide 12 to discuss the drivers of bodily injury development and our claims operating actions to manage loss costs. Bodily injury severities have increased as the mix of claims shifted to more costly claim segments. The chart on the left shows the relative severity of bodily injury claims by type of treatment, major versus non-major and whether the claim is unrepresented, attorney represented or litigated. Major injuries have more expensive medical treatments, greater nonmedical related damages and often more attorney involvement. As a result, paid severity for major injury claims and litigation represented by the first bar on the left costs approximately 3.9x the average paid bodily injury claim. Non-major claims shown on the right-hand side of the chart, have less medical and other related costs intend not to have attorney costs, so unrepresented nonmajor injury claims are roughly 10% of the average cost. Let me be clear, in all cases, we settled the cases for what is fair and equitable regardless of attorney involvement. The table below the chart shows a significant shift from nonmajor claims that have below average cost to major injuries that are represented or in litigation in comparison to historical levels. This shift is partially attributable to more severe accidents. This shift to larger and more complex cases has also resulted in greater variability in paid and case reserve development patterns. As part of our actuarial process, we review changes in claim development patterns to define an appropriate range of estimated outcomes based on weighing historical and more recent trends in the data. The chart on the right side depicts the value of two standard deviations to the average paid in case severity development over the last six report years. As you can see, this measure of variability has almost doubled over the last two years, resulting in a wider range of estimated outcomes. The third quarter reserving process showed a continuation of these development patterns. Therefore, we increased reserves for prior years to reflect the persistence of the trends in major injuries, increased settlement costs and greater variability in case reserves. We're proactively responding to these trends by leveraging sophisticated models, increasing medical expertise, reviewing settlement processes and assessing litigation risks. Now let's move to Slide 13 and briefly discuss physical damage loss costs, which continue to pressure profitability. Rising inflation and delays in third-party carriers subrogation demands are driving higher expected severity in the property damage coverage leading to an increase in the current year -- the current report year variance from 12% to 17% when compared to 2021. The left side of the slide includes a chart we have shown before, which indexes inflation to year-end 2018 for a few of the main inputs to physical damage severity. While used car values are below their recent peak, which is a positive indicator to continue to run more than 50% above pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, labor and parts prices continue to accelerate from the prior peak levels seen just last quarter. This continues to put upward pressure on severities in the near term. The right-hand side of the page shows third-party subrogation demand dollars paid, again, indexed to the year-end 2018. Third-party demands are when our insured isn't an accident and the claimant files a claim to their carrier rather than us. As the other carrier evaluates the claim, the Allstate insured is wholly or partially at fault, they will reach out to us with subrogation demand. We have recently experienced an uptick in the volume of severity -- volume and severity of these demands compared to prior year trends and expectations. It's worth noting that a similar dynamic is also impacting our first-party collision coverages. We are demanding and receiving elevated subrogation collections from other carriers following the declines during the pandemic and backlog and claim settlements due to delayed repairs. Shifting gears now on Slide 14. The Protection Services businesses in the lower strategic growing revenues and increasing shareholder value as we invest in future expansion. Revenues, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives increased 7.2% to $640 million in the quarter, primarily driven by a 12.2% increase in Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $35 million for the third quarter of 2022 decreased $10 million compared to the prior year quarter due to increased severity on appliance repair for Allstate protection plans, in the absence of onetime restructuring expense at Allstate Identity Protection in the prior year quarter as well as investments in growth. Policies in force declined 5%, reflecting the expiration of protection plan warranties primarily due to the -- to a high volume, low premium per policy retail account and overall decline in retail sales. Moving now to Slide 15. Allstate Health and Benefits is also growing an attractive set of businesses that protect millions of policyholders. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual health products to our portfolio, as you can see on the left. Revenues of $570 million in the third quarter of 2022 increased 1.2% to the prior year quarter as growth in group health and employer voluntary benefits was partially offset by a reduction in individual health. Adjusted net income of $54 million increased $21 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting a lower benefit ratio, lower restructuring charges and increased revenue. Shifting now to investments on Slide 16. We'll review the performance and the portfolio risk and return position that we've taken given higher inflation and the possibility of a recession. As you may recall, we reduced our portfolio risk beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021. This included shortening the fixed income duration from 4.6 years to three years through the sale of bonds and use of derivatives, which resulted in a reduction to the portfolio's sensitivity to higher interest rates caused by increasing inflation. We also reduced our exposure to recession-sensitive assets through the sales of high-yield bonds, bank loans and public equity. We maintained this defensive positioning in the third quarter, which continued to preserve portfolio value given ongoing market volatility, rising interest rates and a further decline in public equity markets. As shown in the table, at the bottom left, our total return for the quarter was negative 0.8% and year-to-date is negative 6.4%, while adverse market conditions negatively impacted the portfolio, we estimate our duration shortening mitigated portfolio losses of approximately $2 billion. These proactive actions and the broad diversification of our portfolio produced results that were better than the S&P 500 index which is down 23.9% this year and the Bloomberg Intermediate corporate bond index, which has declined 11.8%. Our net investment income, shown in the chart on the left, totaled $690 million in the quarter, which was $74 million below the third quarter of last year. Performance-based income of $335 million shown in dark blue, was $102 million below a strong quarter in 2021. Three individual investments generated approximately 97% of the performance-based investment income in the quarter, including two sizable cash realizations. Excluding those assets, results of the broader performance-based portfolio were largely flat with negative valuations in our private equity fund investments, which have a higher correlation to public equity markets, offset by increased valuations on other asset classes such as real estate and infrastructure. Our market-based income, which is shown in blue, was $50 million above the prior year quarter, benefiting from reinvestment into market yields that are significantly higher than the overall portfolio's current yield. The table on the right demonstrates how our shorter duration fixed income portfolio is positioned to generate higher levels of investment income as we reinvest into higher interest rates. Our fixed income yield has begun to rise and was 2.9% at quarter end, but is well below the current intermediate corporate bond yield of 5.6%. Now let's take a few minutes to discuss Allstate's financial condition and capital position, starting with Slide 17. Allstate's corporate organizational structure provides sources of capital to the holding company from multiple reporting entities and intermediate holding companies. We manage capital at all levels using economic capital, rating agency models and regulatory requirements to guide decisions and maximize flexibility. We commonly report a view of capital that includes both statutory surplus and parent company -- parent holding company assets. We prefer to dividend money up from subsidiaries to the holding company when possible as it provides more financial flexibility for the organization while maintaining adequate capital levels from subsidiaries to support operations. The chart on the left shows an overview of our capital position since 2016. As you can see, it grew substantially beginning in 2019 following strong results leading up to and during the pandemic. While the current level of $19.8 billion is approximately $6 billion lower than a year ago, this was largely made up of two specific items. First, $3 billion or roughly half is related to the sale of the Life and Annuity business, as represented by the first red bar on the chart. This transaction reduced our statutory capital as we sold the legal entities and significantly reduced our overall risk profile, freeing up an additional $1.7 billion of capital. We returned this capital to shareholders as part of the current $5 billion share repurchase authorization. The second bar reflects our cash returns to shareholders, excluding the impact of the life and annuity sale. Together, these factors reduced capital by $5.4 billion with more than $4 billion going back to shareholders. The last red bar primarily reflects the impact of current auto insurance profitability challenges, which have resulted in a statutory loss and then changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity investments due to recent market volatility. We also added a line to this chart that represents our average capital from year-end 2016 through Q3 of 2021, excluding surplus related to the life and annuity businesses. Our current capital position of $19.8 billion is approximately $1 billion higher than this average, demonstrating that returning cash to shareholders after adjusting our risk profile in recent years of profitability has left us in a strong capital position. The right-hand side of this page isolates holding company assets, a key component of our capital relative to the remaining authorized repurchases and fixed charges. At the end of the third quarter, we had $4.5 billion in holding company assets with $1.2 billion remaining on the current share repurchase authorization, we would still have $3.3 billion remaining in comparison to our annual fixed charges of $1.3 billion. We believe holding company assets and capital resources available from statutory operating companies provide significant financial flexibility as we continue to implement profit improvement actions and invest in transformative growth. Now let's move to Slide 18 to discuss Allstate's strong cash return to shareholders. Adjusted net income return on equity of 4.3% was below the prior year, primarily due to lower underwriting income. Achieving our targeted combined ratios for auto and homeowners insurance will bring adjusted net income returns on equity back to our long-term targeted range of 14% to 17%. Through the first three quarters of 2022, we've returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through $2.1 billion in share repurchases and $698 million in common shareholder dividends. Over the last year, shares outstanding have been reduced by 7.7%, providing more upside per share as profitability has improved. There's $1.2 billion remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase authorization as of September 30, which we expect to be completed in the second or third quarter of 2023 and as we moderately slow the pace of our repurchases. With that context, we're going to open up the line for your questions. Yes. Thanks, Tom. Greg, what I would start with is, I think it's important to be clear on one thing. At the end of every quarter, we record reserves at an appropriate level based on all the information that we have in front of us. We did that at the end of Q3 and every quarter leading up to Q3. We followed the same process that we have in the past. It's a rigorous process. It leverages internal actuarial expertise, close collaboration with our claims team and third-party reviews to analyze the most current data and assess the impact on that data on our reserves. . As I look at the quarter, the variability that we've seen continue to come through in the data that we reviewed as part of our actual process. So Q3 data supported more recent trends and continued variability in reserve development. And while these trends weren't new, an additional quarter of data did provide new insights into the persistent nature of the trends that have been emerging. So insights from actual claims development in the quarter, led us to strengthen both prior year reserves and increase our report year 2022 ultimate severities. So as I take a step back and think about where we're at from a reserve perspective, we record appropriate reserves based on what we know at the time. We used current data and all known factors to establish the reserves. So I'm confident in what we set up. And I think that the new insights that we cleaned in Q3 caused us to make the move. That's a pretty complete answer, Tom. But I think the important point is that the proactive capital management that really relies on our robust economic capital approach, which looks at risk on a granular basis and takes that information to understand capital needs in an enterprise level. Premium surplus only looks at one dimension of risk and capital, and we use a more complete set of measures and metrics to establish capital levels, as Tom laid out. So I just think it's important. We're cognizant of and we monitor regulatory capital requirements, rating agency capital benchmarks, all in our proactive capital management process. But I feel the same way that Tom does it that we certainly have plenty of money to execute on our strategies and continue to implement our profit improvement plan. So nothing more to add, Tom. I don't have anything more than that. I think we did move some capital down into the Life company. at 1 point, Tom. But I think that certainly is no longer an issue, but that's the last thing that I remember. Mario? . That's right, Tom. We don't disclose the split, so we don't have that."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's start by reviewing underwriting profitability for the Property Liability business in total on Slide 5. Our underwriting results reflect the high level of inflation and the impact of reserve strengthening in the quarter with a third quarter recorded combined ratio of 117.4% for auto, 91.2% for homeowners, 126.6% for all other lines and 111.6% for total property liability, which is shown on the left chart. Remember, our goal is to run the auto business with a combined ratio in the mid-90s and homeowners at around 90, while homeowners was close to our target in the quarter, we continue to focus on improving auto margins through a comprehensive plan that is being implemented to get us back to our mid-90s objective. The third quarter underlying combined ratio for auto insurance was 104, as you can see on the right. So we're raising auto insurance prices, reducing growth investments, lowering operating expenses and adapting claims practices to a high inflationary environment. While the homeowners business generated $245 million of underwriting profit, higher severity resulted in an underlying combined ratio of 74.6%, which is above where we manage it to, and we are increasing prices through both rates and the inflationary adjustment factor embedded in our homeowners product to improve underlying margins going forward. One of the reasons that we have an industry-leading homeowners business is because we proactively manage the risk and return profile of each market that we operate in. Based on this approach, we have decided to stop writing new homeowners and condo insurance in California at this time, given our inability to fully reflect the cost of providing these products in the state, including both loss and reinsurance costs. We intend to continue protecting our existing California property customers by offering ongoing coverage to them. Other lines are mainly traditional small commercial auto and shared economy insurance, both of which have recorded and underlying combined ratios above target levels. As a result, we made the decision to exit 5 states in the traditional small commercial business and no longer provide insurance to transportation network companies unless pricing begins to utilize a telematics-based framework for pricing. These actions are expected to reduce commercial business premiums by over 50% next year. Let's move to Slide 6 and discuss auto profitability in more detail. As you can see from the chart on the left, which shows the auto insurance combined ratio and underlying combined ratio over time. We have a long history of meeting or outperforming our mid- combined ratio target, supported by our pricing sophistication, underwriting and claims equities and expense management. 2020 is an outlier with much better than target results due to reduced accident frequency in the early stages of the pandemic. In 2021 and again this year, we have experienced both higher frequency than 2020 and the impacts of inflation, which have dramatically increased the cost to repair or replace cars and raise the cost of settling injury claims with third parties who are injured in accidents with our customers. In addition, this quarter, we strengthened prior year reserves by $643 million, which Jeff will discuss in more detail in a few minutes and experienced higher catastrophe losses mainly from flooding associated with Hurricane in. As a result, the auto insurance recorded combined ratio was 117.4% with reserve strengthening and catastrophes contributing 8.5 and 4.4 points, respectively, to this result. The right chart quantifies the drivers in the year-over-year change in the underlying combined ratio, which increased from 97.6 to 104 and excludes catastrophes and the reserve changes. The red bar reflects the increase in underlying losses, primarily due to current report year incurred severity strengthening across major coverages and moderately higher frequency than last year. The increase to underlying loss costs were partially offset by 4.3 points of average earned premiums from implemented rate increases and a 3.1 point reduction in underwriting expenses to get to the 104. To add more clarity to the current quarter results, we also highlight the 2.6 point impact of increasing full year claim severities in the third quarter for claims that were reported in the first and second quarter of this year. This impact is noted by the green bar on the right-hand chart. Excluding this intra-year strengthening, the third quarter underlying combined ratio would have been 101.4. Current report year incurred severity for collision and property damage claims were increased to 17% above the level reported for the full year 2021, and bodily injury severity was increased to 12%. Moving to Slide 7, let's discuss key components of our multifaceted plan to deal with inflation, raising auto insurance prices. Growth in average premium per policy is accelerating due to implemented rate increases over the last 12 months, but the impact to average earned premium per policy is on a lag due to the 6-month policy term. Over the last 12 months, we've implemented Allstate brand auto rate increases across 53 locations for an annualized written premium impact of approximately 13.7% or nearly $3.3 billion, including 4.7% in the third quarter. The chart on the page is an estimation of when the rate increases implemented in the last 12 months will be earned into premiums. This illustrative example assumes only 85% of the annualized written premium will be earned to account for retention and the fact that some customers modify policy terms, such as deductibles or limits when faced with price increases. As you can see, looking back at Q3 2022, the estimated impact of the $3.3 billion in annualized implemented rate had only an estimated impact of $660 million on earned premium, which is expected to grow by over $2.1 billion through the end of next year. Given the ongoing loss cost inflation, we expect to implement additional rate increases in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2023, and those will be on top of increases implemented since Q4 of last year and additive to the increases shown here. Moving to Slide 8, let's discuss the timing of how these rate increases will impact the combined ratio for auto insurance. The chart on this page is an illustrative view to show our path to target profitability, along with the magnitude of actions already taken and required prospectively. Starting on the left, through the first nine months of the year, the auto insurance recorded combined ratio is 109.3% as shown by the first blue bar. From this starting point, we removed the impact of prior year reserve increases and normalize the catastrophe loss ratio to our 5-year historical average. This improves the combined ratio by approximately 6 points represented by the first green bar. The second green bar reflects the estimated impact of rate actions already implemented when fully earned in the premium which is an additional $2.3 billion of premium across the Allstate and National General brands or approximately 8 points. These amounts will be mostly earned by the end of 2023. Of course, loss costs will likely continue to increase, whether from inflationary impacts on severity or higher accident frequency, which would increase the combined ratio. Prospective rate increases must meet or exceed loss cost increases to achieve historical returns. Combined with other non-rate actions such as reducing new business and expenses, we expect to achieve an auto insurance combined ratio target in the mid-90s. The timing of reaching this goal will be largely dependent on the relative increase in premiums and future loss cost trends. Moving to Slide 9. Let's now take a look at our industry-leading homeowners business. As you know, a significant portion of our customers bundle home and auto insurance, which improves retention and the overall economics of both product lines. We have a differentiated homeowners product, underwriting, reinsurance and claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. Our long-term under result -- underwriting results reflect this dynamic with a 5-year average recorded combined ratio of 91.9%. The third quarter combined ratio for homeowners improved to 91.2%, primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses compared to the prior year quarter, as you can see by the chart on the left. Enterprise risk and return management actions reduced our Florida personal property market share to 2.6%, which, combined with a comprehensive reinsurance program, including our stand-alone Florida property coverage, significantly mitigated net losses from Hurricane Ian. Estimated gross catastrophe losses due to the hurricane totaled $671 million and were reduced by $305 million in expected reinsurance recoveries, primarily related to property reinsurance for our stand-alone Florida property insurance company, . Of the $366 million net loss from Ian, only approximately 25% was from property lines. Homeowners insurance is certainly not immune to the rising inflationary environment as we continue to be impacted by increasing labor and material costs. In the third quarter, non-catastrophe prior year reserves were strengthened by $51 million, and current report year incurred severity was increased primarily as a result of increasing inflation in both labor and material costs. The resulting impact to the underlying combined ratio from current year severity strengthening was 3.8 points in the third quarter, partially offset by slightly lower non-catastrophe frequency. Similar to auto insurance, there was an intra-year impact of 2.4 points related to claims reported in the first and second quarter of this year, which was reflected in the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2022. To combat inflation challenges, our products have sophisticated pricing features that respond to changes in replacement values. The chart on the right shows key homeowners insurance operating statistics. Net written premium has grown sharply throughout 2021 and into 2022, increasing 9.4% from the prior year quarter and 12.9% year-to-date, primarily driven by a more than 13% increase in Allstate brand average gross premium per policy and a 1.4% increase in policies in force. The Allstate brand increases are partially offset by lower National General premiums and policies in force as we improve underwriting margins to targeted levels in this brand. We are continuing to raise homeowners' prices to address inflationary pressures, both through the impact of inflation on insured home valuations and filed rate increases. Beyond these pricing actions, we have also decided to limit new business where margin targets cannot be achieved in the near term, including the action I previously noted of suspending the sale of new homeowners insurance policies to consumers in California. Let's delve deeper into improving customer value through expense reductions on Slide 10. Let me start by saying we remain on pace and committed to our long-term objective to reduce our adjusted expense ratio which is a metric we introduced about a year ago to track our underlying progress to improve customer value. This metric starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding things like restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. Through innovation and strong execution, we've achieved almost three points of improvement since 2018. Over time, we expect to drive more than three points of additional improvements from current levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024, and which represents a 6-point reduction compared to 2018. The chart on the slide shows the Allstate Protection underwriting expense ratio since 2018 and quantifies the impacts from third quarter 2022 compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting actions we've taken to address the current operating environment. The first green bar on the left shows the decline in advertising spend as growth investments have been reduced given our focus on improving margins. The next green bar shows a decline in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, primarily driven by the phaseout of enhanced compensation models for new agents. Our future cost reduction efforts are focused on digitization, sourcing and operating efficiency and continuing to reduce distribution costs. Let me now turn it over to Jess to discuss our reserving actions in the quarter and the remainder of our business results in more detail. Yes, sure. Brian. Yes, I think, Brian, in terms of what we're seeing, we're factoring in, obviously, the inflation we're experiencing currently, but also projecting it going forward so that we can reflect the full cost of loss costs prospectively into our prices. And so yes, we're not making any kind of significant assumptions around a deceleration in inflation going forward given the current inflationary environment, that's why we made the statement that we expect to continue to take rate increases certainly for the balance of this year but into next year, and that's really a reflection of the environment we're operating right now and the continued elevated level of inflation, which we need to kind of catch up with and then surpass going forward. So we're not assuming, as I said, any significant reduction in inflationary trends going forward. Yes, I would concur the last time I remember any meaningful movement of capital down into an operating company. would have been during the financial crisis, which obviously was a while ago. But as Tom mentioned, we moved capital around but nothing in terms of shortfalls within any of the insurance companies."

And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.  Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results.  As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2021 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Additionally, we will be hosting our next special topic investor call on September 1, focusing on Allstate's investment strategy.  Now I'll turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Wilson: Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time with Allstate today. Let's start on Slide 2.  So Allstate's strategy to increase shareholder value has 2 components: increase personal property-liability market share and expand Protection services, which are shown in the 2 ovals on the left. We're building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution we transformed the growth. We're also diversifying our business by expanding protection offers and by leveraging the Allstate brand, customer base capabilities and expanding distribution.  On the panel on the right, in the second quarter, we made progress executing this strategy, while we continue to implement a comprehensive strategy to improve profitability. That includes broadly raising auto and home insurance rates. In the second half of 2022, we plan to file for rate increases in excess of the increases implemented in the first half of this year, which were 6.1% of Allstate brand countrywide premiums. We're also reducing expenses on advertising and growth investments. Underwriting guidelines have been and will be changed to reduce new business volume, where we're not earning adequate returns. And we're also executing claims operating actions to manage loss cost in a high inflationary environment. These actions will likely have a negative impact on policy growth.  And now while the current environment requires a huge focus on margin improvement, we continue to advance our transformative growth strategy where profitability -- when profitability levels are acceptable we'll have a business model to capture market share.  The Protection Services businesses are generating profitable growth, although earnings declined slightly this quarter as we invest in that growth. Given the negative impact of inflation on the auto insurance business, as you know, beginning late last year, we reduced the bond portfolio duration to lower exposure to higher interest rates, which helped mitigate the reduction in bond valuations by approximately $1.3 billion in the first half of 2022. Our strong capital position enabled us to maintain high cash returns to shareholders in this environment.  Moving to Slide 3, let's review second quarter performance in more detail. Total revenues decreased 3.4% in the prior year quarter, despite property liability premiums earned increasing 8.6%, which reflected higher average premiums and policy growth. Higher loss costs in the current report year and upward loss reserve development of $411 million in the prior report years resulted in a property liability recorded combined ratio of 107.9 in the second quarter.  Net investment income of $562 million was 42% below the prior year quarter since performance-based income was exceptional in the prior year. Net losses on investments and derivatives were $733 million in the quarter as lower valuations and equity investments and losses on fixed income sales, which were only partially offset by the derivative gains associated with the bond portfolio duration shortening. The combination of these factors led to a net loss of $1.4 billion in the second quarter and an adjusted net loss of $209 million or $0.76 per diluted share.  The adjusted net income return on equity was 6.9% over the last 12 months, which is obviously unacceptable from our standpoint. It's substantially below the levels we achieved at this time last year, but we remain committed to achieving our long-term returns on equity of between 14% and 17%.  Now let me turn it over to Glenn to talk -- walk through our property liability results in more detail.\nGlenn Shapiro: Thank you, Tom. Let's start by reviewing underwriting profitability on Slide 4. The underwriting results reflect the high level of inflation, which is increasing severity leading to an underlying combined ratio of 93.4 for the second quarter and a recorded combined ratio of 107.9, which is shown in the chart on the left.  The chart on the right compares last year's recorded combined ratio of 95.7 to this year's second quarter. A higher auto insurance underlying loss ratio drove 8.6 of the 12.2 point increase as claims severity has been increasing faster than earned rate increases.  The other large negative impact was from prior year reserve strengthening this quarter, which I'll cover in a few minutes. The one positive impact on there was the 1.7 points from expense reductions.  Let's move to Slide 5 and talk about profitability and rising loss costs in more detail. As you know, we have a target combined ratio for auto insurance in the mid-90s. And you can see on the chart, which shows the combined ratio by year and then the first 2 quarters of this year, that we have a long history of meeting or exceeding those targets, which is supported by our pricing sophistication, underwriting, claims expertise and expense management.  Now in there, you'll see 2020 was an outlier because we had much better than target results than due to some of the early pandemic frequency impacts. And as we move from that environment to the high inflationary environment we're in today, incurred claims severities increased the underlying auto combined ratio of 102.1 for the quarter and 100.5 year-to-date.  Auto non-catastrophe prior year reserve strengthening in the second quarter totaled $275 million, which is primarily physical damage and injury coverages. The most significant impact, though, on the combined ratio was report year incurred severity for collision, property damage and bodily injury claims, which increased by 16%, 12% and 9%, respectively, over the average of the full year 2021 incurred. Because the costs were rising rapidly during 2021, the quarter-to-quarter increase comparison is even greater. And frequency also went up about 5 to 7 points, but it's still well below pre-pandemic levels.  So let's go to Slide 6, and we'll go deeper into the prior year physical damage for reserve development. The chart on the left shows used car values. They began to rise in 2020. And if you go back looking from the beginning of 2019 to current, used car prices have gone up more than 60% and continue to stay at an elevated level.  At the same time, OEM parts and labor rates have increased during the first half of this year, which causes severity increases for coverages like collision and property damage. Now we anticipated that those trends and the delays that are taking cars a long time to be repaired right now would increase the amount of claim payments we made on 2021 losses after the end of the year, even though these are relatively short-duration claims.  The chart on the right shows gross paid losses for physical damage coverages for the 6 months after the end of the calendar year. Now our expectation for paid losses for 2021 claims from months 13 to 18 was that it would be about $1.25 billion, which you can see from the chart is about 40% above the prior year. You can see that from the dash line on the far right bar compared to the bars to the left of it.  But at the end of the second quarter, the actual paid losses were $1.48 billion, which exceeded even our higher estimate by $230 million and is a large driver of the prior year reserve increases. All other non-catastrophe prior year development, primarily from injury, commercial auto and homeowners, totaled $268 million in the quarter.  Let's go to Slide 7 and discuss how higher auto insurance rates have been and will be implemented to improve profitability. Since the beginning of the year, we've implemented broad rate increases across the country, as shown on the map, at 9 states where we had increases over 10%, and auto rates have been increased in 48 locations, inclusive of Canadian provinces. Those rate increases are expected to increase Allstate brand annualized written premium by 6.1%.  Now we have not been able to get adequate rate in New York or any increase in rate in California. New York represents about 9% of our auto premium. And the implemented rate there was, we leveraged the annual flex filings process there. And it gave us less than 5% rate in our current indicated indication there is significantly higher than that to get to an adequate return.  Similarly, in California, which represents about 12% of our auto premium, we recently filed in the second quarter, a 6.9% increase, which again is significantly below the overall rate need there. In states markets, risk segments or channels where we cannot achieve an adequate price for the risk, we're implementing more restrictive underwriting actions and reducing new business as needed until adequate levels of rate are approved.  Let's move to Slide 8, and we'll look at how these rate increases are impacting and will impact the combined ratio for auto insurance. What you see here illustrates our path to target profitability, along with the magnitude of actions we've already taken and what's required prospectively.  Starting on the left. Through the first 6 months of the year, our auto insurance recorded combined ratio is 105, and that's shown in the blue bar. To start with, we normalized that by removing the impact of prior year reserve increases and going to a 5-year average on catastrophe losses, that improves the combined ratio by 2.5 points represented by the first green bar.  The second green bar reflects the estimated impact of rate actions already implemented when fully earned into premium. So these are already implemented actions that are in market and renewing on policies. They total an additional $1.7 billion of effective premium across Allstate and national general brands. Those will be earned over the coming quarters and fully earned by the end of 2023.  Now of course, loss costs will continue to increase, whether it's inflationary impacts on severity or higher frequency, which would increase the combined ratio from what I just described there. So prospective rate increases must exceed the loss cost increases that come to achieve our target returns.  Now everything I just described, combined with our non-rate actions such as reducing new business and expenses, gives us a track where we expect to achieve our target combined ratio in the mid-90s in auto insurance. Now the timing of that will be largely dependent on the relative increases and pace of these increases in premium and loss costs.  So on Page 9, we'll take a look again at our industry-leading homeowners business. As you know, a significant portion of our customers, bundle home and auto insurance, and that improves the retention and the overall economics of both products. We have a differentiated ecosystem in homeowners. That includes a differentiated product, underwriting, reinsurance, claim capabilities, and we discussed a lot of those capabilities in our last special topic call.  Our long-term underwriting results show the strength of the system. Our 5-year average reported combined ratio is 91.9, as shown in the chart on the left. And that produced $3.3 billion of underwriting profit since 2017, while the industry lost over $20 billion in that same period.  Now our second quarter combined ratio and most second quarter combined ratios have historically been higher than full year results, primarily due to catastrophes. And second quarter this year was at 106.9, which reflected again higher catastrophes and 1.7 points of unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve estimates.  Our year-to-date recorded combined ratio for home is 95.8. Now homeowners insurance is certainly not immune to the inflationary environment we're in, and we continue to see increases in labor and material costs. To combat that, our product has sophisticated pricing features that respond to changes in replacement values, and we've taken rate.  If you see on the chart on the right that shows some of the key Allstate brand homeowners operating statistics, we've grown net written premium by 15.2% from the prior year. And that's on a policy base that we grew of 1.2% in the second quarter, where our Allstate agents remain in a really good position to broaden customer relationships.  So as you've heard me say several times and certainly in our last special topic call, we're really well positioned at homeowners to not only maintain the competitive advantage we have, but to grow that line of business.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mario.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Glenn. As Tom mentioned, while we are improving profitability, we also continue to invest in the core components of the transformative growth strategy to increase market share in the personal property-liability business.  Slide 10 is the flywheel of growth that we have discussed on earlier calls. Transformative growth is a multiyear initiative designed to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution.  I won't get into all the pieces today, but I want to highlight 2 specific items: first, we remain committed to achieving our adjusted expense ratio goal of 23 by year-end 2024, which represents a 6-point improvement compared to year-end 2018; secondly, in the quarter, we launched beta versions of a new fully digital auto insurance product and sales experience made possible with new technology for relationship initiation and product delivery.  Building these foundational elements will enable us to scale growth when adequate insurance pricing is a tank.  At the same time, the Protection Services businesses, in the lower strategic oval, are growing and increasing shareholder value, as shown on Slide 11.  Revenues, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, increased 8.3% to $629 million in the quarter, primarily driven by Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $43 million for the second quarter of 2022 decreased $13 million compared to the prior year quarter as ongoing investments and growth are being made to position these businesses for future success.  Policies in force did decrease by 1.6%, reflecting expiring Protection Plan warranties and lower retail sales compared to the favorable environment in the prior year quarter.  Moving to Slide 12. Allstate Health and Benefits is also growing. It is also growing an attractive set of businesses that protect millions of policyholders. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual health products to our portfolio, as you can see on the left.  Revenues of $574 million in the second quarter of 2022 increased to 4.6% for the prior year quarter, driven primarily by growth in group and individual health businesses. Adjusted net income of $65 million increased $3 million from the prior year quarter, driven by increased revenue, which was partially offset by a higher benefit ratio, primarily in individual health.  Now let's shift to investments on Slide 13 to review investment performance and the portfolio risk and return position we have taken given higher inflation and the possibility of a recession. Net investment income totaled $562 million in the quarter, which is $412 million below the prior year quarter, as shown in the chart on the left.  Market-based income, shown in blue, was $13 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase in the fixed income portfolio yields, which are now benefiting from investing in yields that are higher than the overall portfolio's current yield. Performance-based income of $236 million, shown in dark blue, was $413 million below with an exceptional quarter in 2021. The performance-based internal rate of return over the last 12 months was 24.6%, which remains above our long-term return expectations. The performance-based portfolio includes private equity as well as a mix of other asset types such as real estate and infrastructure, which diversify our performance in this segment.  In the second quarter, real estate investments had strong performance, including gains on asset sales, while private equity results were lower. As a reminder, our performance-based results are reported based on a 1 quarter lag, so second quarter results reflect March 31 sponsored financial statements, and future returns will reflect market and economic conditions from the prior quarter.  The total portfolio return was negative 2.8% for the quarter and negative 5.6% year-to-date due to higher interest rates and credit spreads, lowering the market value of bonds and a decline in public equity valuations. While these market conditions negatively impacted the market value of the portfolio, it continues to generate operating income. And because of proactive portfolio actions, the results are better than the broad indices with the S&P 500 Index 20% lower and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 10% lower.  The chart on the right illustrates the shift in risk positioning we have executed to protect portfolio value and position us to take advantage of opportunities as conditions evolve. We reduced interest rate risk towards the end of 2021 and into the first quarter through the sale of longer-duration bonds and the use of derivatives. The portfolio duration is shorter than our long-term targets, which has mitigated the negative impact of higher market rates by approximately $1.3 billion this year.  With recession concerns rising, the exposure to recession risk-sensitive assets was also reduced through sales of high-yield bonds, bank loans and public equity. These sales were largely executed prior to the most significant credit spread widening and equity market decline for the end of the quarter, further preserving portfolio value.  Now let's move to Slide 14 to discuss Allstate's strong cash returns to shareholders of $1.9 billion in the first 2 quarters. Over the last year, shares outstanding have been reduced by 8.7%, providing more upside per share as profitability has improved. In addition, there is another $1.8 billion remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase authorization.  Adjusted net income return on equity of 6.9% was below the prior year period, primarily due to lower underwriting income. Achieving our target combined ratios for both auto and homeowners insurance will bring adjusted net income returns on equity back to our long-term target range of 14% to 17%.  With that context, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: I would like to go back to Slide 8 for my first question. And I guess the 2 areas that caught my attention as you were running through them, Glenn, were the future loss costs arrow and the rate and other actions. And then in the box, you say you're pursuing larger rate increases in the second half of 2022 relative to the first half. So maybe you can give us some additional detail around what you guys are thinking on those 2 areas in that chart?\nThomas Wilson: Greg, this is Tom. I'll do a bit of overviewing. Glenn, you can jump right in. First, Greg, as you know, we don't give perspective -- earnings estimates in order to give perspective line-by-line. We would expect future loss costs to go up, like we don't -- and we're booking to have them go up in the future. And we also, as we mentioned, expect to take increase in rates.  With that, Glenn, do you want to provide some more perspective on both the trends you're seeing historically in loss cost and then what you're -- where we're thinking about -- how you're thinking about rate increases.\nGlenn Shapiro: Sure. Greg, on the loss cost piece of it, I know there's been some opinion out there that maybe the worst is behind us and the inflation will slow or just listening to other calls out there. We're not sure of that, and we certainly want to have the rate outpace the loss trends.  One thing I'll say is when you look at our frequency trend, I think this is a unique time in history where typically frequency is harder to predict than severity. And I think the opposite is true right now. Our frequency has been really, really steady. You look at it from the low points of the pandemic up to where it is now, it is just steadily crept back up but has leveled out in that creep, and we have good data and expectation that it remains below the pre-pandemic levels, but continues to rise slightly as it has.  And on the other side, severity, it's a big wild card out there, I think, in all industries right now as to how long and how severe inflation runs with the actions of the Fed and anything else out there, we're taking the conservative viewpoint that we need a lot more rate in order to offset that.  So I mentioned in the prepared remarks, a couple of places where we're having trouble on it, and we're working through it. But broadly, I will tell you, it's gone very well in that the regulators we work with, good relationships across the country, and we're getting some meaningful rates going through the pipeline right now, and they understand.  I mean the math is on our side, and we need to get those rates in to offset those future rate trends because as the slide depicts, if you froze time and loss costs didn't move, we would earn our way right to the mid-90s combined ratio over the coming quarters, but that isn't the case. We need additional rate to offset those loss trends.\nCharles Peters: Got it. You slipped in the reference to Slide 7 in your answer, Glenn, which was going to be my other area of focus, which is you talk about reducing new business in states without appropriate rates. In the slide, I think you -- well, you do call out California, New York, are there other states where you're having some problems getting the rate approved that you need? Or are just those the 2 principal states?\nThomas Wilson: Greg, I'll let Glenn give you the specifics there. But it isn't just to like negotiate. And I'm reading into your statement. I know you're not really saying that, but it's also to just maintain our loss cost. Like we just -- even if we get a rate increase, there may be certain cells or certain segments of the state that are less -- where we have less profitability than we want. So it's also about managing profitability.  Glenn, why don't you give some specifics on that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. And I'll just build on that because it's exactly right. It really is -- it's segments within states, it's markets within states, and it's even channels. I mean look at the fact that right now, National General is performing quite well, both from a growth and a profit standpoint. And so we can position based on where we can be profitable, whether it's channel, market, segment of risk, and that's kind of how we're thinking about new business.  We -- to put it very simply, we don't want to write new business that we're not profitable on. And it's not as simple as looking at, you can see in our disclosures, the number of states where we're above 100 or above 96. And because it's -- that's the rearview mirror.  The prospective view is where we've already gotten rates. And in some of the states that we feel good about the price we're putting on for new business and we'll grow in those.  To answer your specific question, New Jersey would be another place that we're working hard on and need to get more rate. But the vast majority of states across the country, we've been working through, and we're in good shape in.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.\nThomas Wilson: Jonathan, we didn't hear him. I don't know if you did or I don't know, Andrew, if you're on mute or not, but we didn't hear him.\nOperator: You couldn't hear him?\nThomas Wilson: Now we can hear you. Now we can't.\nMark Nogal: Jonathan, I think we move to the next question. We can' hear...\nThomas Wilson: Andrew, maybe you want to question to Mark, and he can ask it for you, if you want. But let's move on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: I guess I'm just looking through what rates you're submitting, and that slowed down. And I'm specifically talking about auto insurance rate increase filings. It looks like the amount of the rate increase that you guys submitted during the second quarter slowed materially versus the first quarter. I'm just wondering why that was?\nThomas Wilson: David, I'll make a comment and then Glenn can -- if there's anything you want to add, you might jump in. First, we are fully committed to increasing rates necessary to get our combined ratio down to the target levels that Glenn talked about, that obviously bounces around by quarter.  And what you saw is what we got implemented in the second quarter, in the early part of your question, you said submitting as in forward-looking, that's not what we're submitting. What you saw in that release is just what got implemented. We're obviously in conversations with regulators when you have these kind of increases continuously.  So there are some states where Glenn's team chooses to go down and meet with the regulators, explain the numbers and then submit it and so we feel good about where we're headed there.  Glenn, anything you want to add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. I would just add, it really is about timing and about which states go through. So like if you look at the amount we filed per state, we really haven't backed off at all, David, it is the states that went through in that cycle. It just -- they aren't as large. And so the countrywide impact when you do a medium or smaller state population-wise is lesser than the big states.  We have some very large states going through the pipeline right now. And I think you'll see that timing level itself out, and it's why we're able to say to you that we are seeking more rate in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. We have some very large states with meaningful rate increases going through.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Yes. I was referring to -- I obviously can see the implemented rate. I was referring to submitted, which I guess is something that's -- they're not approved or disapproved yet. It's just more kind of a leading indicator that I track, and it just looked like you guys had slowed a little bit in the second quarter versus the first quarter.  But it does sound like that is more timing related as well. Maybe for just another question, I was just looking through the businesses in auto specifically, and I noticed that the Allstate brand combined ratio was 9 points above the NatGen combined ratio for the quarter and has been trending -- it's been higher for the last few quarters.  Could you just -- yes, that's kind of counterintuitive to me just given the differences in those books of business. So could you just maybe talk about what's going on between those two?\nThomas Wilson: David, it's an astute question, and let me -- but let me take it up a level and then get Glenn to jump into NatGen versus the Allstate brand. Because many of you have also written and asked about like how do you stand versus competitors and stuff on that? So let me just take it up and deal with that, and then we'll go into the specifics.  So like you, we always look at different comparisons, whether it's internal or external, to get a sense for our performance. That said, when it's external, it tends to be more directional versus our variance analysis because of the differences in strategies and particularly it gives you got different strategies, different risk profiles, different state mix.  It's better if you look at the long-term results rather than quarterly numbers, particularly when you're using percentage changes on a quarter-by-quarter.  That said, the numbers are the numbers, and you need to understand them and evaluate them. First thing I would say is when you look at -- most of you have asked about Progressive, they're a really strong competitors, so we have great respect to them. As it relates to auto insurance over a long period of time, Allstate, Progressive and GEICO have all had attractive returns.  And we're all dealing with the impact of what I would say, a wide swings in frequency and severity for auto claims, in particular that's driven by the pandemic and then the related inflationary impacts on tower repairs and prices. They did report, that is Progressive, a better combined ratio than us this quarter as they began raising prices earlier in 2021.  But again, we don't know why, like we're not them. But they did have different trends in frequency both last year and this year. So and of course, claims statistics are different for everybody and sometimes people change them how they count them over time. But the numbers I see are that in 2020, we both had frequency declines from 2019, that was reflecting the impact of shutting down the economy. So we were down -- in collision, we were down 26%, and they were down, I think, about 23%, 24%.  Last year, their collision frequency increased by 26%, whereas ours increased by only 18%. So you would expect them to raise prices more than we raise them. This year, they're down in frequency, and we're up. So you would expect our combined ratio to be higher than theirs.  It's hard to say why these short-term trends are different. But Glenn will talk, it may be that they have a relatively small share of the customer statement that they call the Robinson. And so the comparison to NatGen will be helpful for you to see how that's different. It could be state mix. It could be a whole bunch of other things. So I can't intuit exactly the results.  And so Glenn will go through that risk mix and show you how that impacts the different results.  As it relates to the strength of the business model, though, and your strategy, I think it's also worthwhile looking at other lines. And as we talked about on our last call, Allstate is an industry leader in homeowners with very attractive combined ratios. The reported combined ratio this quarter, again, is higher, as Glenn talked about, than it typically is in the second quarter.  On a longer-term basis, though, we've obviously done quite well.  To put that in perspective, if we had 112.5 combined ratio on our homeowners business, last year, our underwriting income would have been about $1.6 billion lower than it actually was, and that's particularly hard on a business that requires twice as much capital as auto insurance.  As it relates to commitment to profitability, speed, precision, we dramatically reshaped that business, which we took you through. So our business models tend to be good and precise, we tend to look at both lines of business and see how we're doing.  With that, Glenn, do you want to talk about NatGen versus the Allstate rate?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes, I will. Well, David, you're getting a good detailed answer there from Tom and after me, you like hit the daily double here because it is a really good question and an important one.  I want to take you back and kind of look at it over the 18 months that we've owned NatGen and since the closing of that deal, and it's a good time frame to use because 18 months is the time it takes to earn out the full annualized premium changes also.  So you go back to first quarter 2021, and this would be true, by the way, not only of comparison of Allstate brand and NatGen but Allstate to other competitors, like Tom was talking about. Allstate was running a combined ratio about 10 points lower. And the reason for that was the frequency was lower, frequency on more nonstandard or near nonstandard business came back much quicker as people needed to use their cars to make a living, and there was just a difference between different books of business.  And so as a result, the good news was for the Allstate brand was that is a really low combined ratio. It's around 80. The bad news is in the current state would be to say that, well, when you're running at that level, you need to take rates now. I mean you can't sustain and even in some places, require you to refile your rates, you can't sustain that level that far below target combined ratios.  And National General, on the other hand, was still taking a maintenance level of rates up over that period of time. So now flash forward to today, their frequency down while all states is up. And then you've got a higher average earned premium going through.  And I mentioned before the $1.7 billion of premium that we have already in the system, not only filed but approved and already like renewing on policies that hasn't been earned yet, we've actually only earned 15% of the premium that's been raised through this cycle. So we get 85% of it out there still left to be earned, whereas National General is earning off of a base, plus they didn't have the hole to fill, so to speak, of the negative rates that, again, we appropriately took because when you're running an 80 combined ratio, but you got to fill that up to get back to par and then go up from there. So there's a difference in the average earned premium that's a few points to the differences, one.  Two, there's a few points difference on the frequency levels right now. Three, and this is a really important one when you're looking across companies is the risks are different and the policies are different. So as you think about the inflationary factors and how they're hitting different policies, National General, even inside their own book, it's really fascinating.  If you look at their full coverage policies versus their liability-only policies, they're running about 10 points different on trend in their combined ratio. Because if you think about a liability-only policy, you don't have collision, which is the highest inflationary trend of any coverage right now, one. Two, you tend to have very low liability limits, so on things like, let's say, property damage. If you have a state minimum of $10,000 of property-liability coverage and you hit somebody's car and you total it, whether it's before the inflation factors that were hitting us or after, you're probably just going to pay that $10,000. And the inflation, there's a computation to that inflation. Whereas when you typically have $100,000 limits, you're bearing the full weight of the change in the value of vehicles.  So looking at all these components, we see just a lot of different ways, and I didn't even get into state mix, which is another one, a lot of different ways that the trends move differently. The nice thing is having acquired NatGen, and it's performing really well, it's growing nicely, it's profitable, is that it's really acting right now as a bit of a diversification on that auto trend and gives us a place where we are able and willing to grow.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.\nAndrew Kligerman: Can you hear me this time?\nThomas Wilson: We can.\nAndrew Kligerman: I'm sorry about that before. First question is around non-rate actions. Could you give a little color on some of the more material non-rate actions that you could take and the potential magnitude we might be able to see in the back half of the year on loss ratio? How much potential improvement could that offer?\nThomas Wilson: Glenn can give you the items. I think we probably won't be able to give you an attribution on what that will do for this year's combined ratio. Glenn, what do you -- do you want to take that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So I'll give you a few like you've got underwriting actions where we segment the business and we segment our pricing to where, as Tom said earlier, it isn't just about, geez, we're going to not write new business in this market, let's say, it's, well, we're profitable in these segments and not those other ones. So we're going to change the segmentation of our pricing, would be one.  Another would be, we changed the down payment on policies and expect that there's a change in the flow of business at times with that. Certainly, the targeting of marketing is a really big one that I think can be underplayed, but we're pretty sophisticated in how we go to market.  So when and where are we putting up banner ads when people are searching for auto insurance, which risk categories, which markets? And flat out, we've taken a lot of marketing dollars out right now. We're just reducing the marketing that we're doing: one, it will improve expense; two, it will lower the new business flow and allow us to more quickly get back to profitability; and then the last one I'll say is the sales incentives that are out there with our agents about how we're incentivizing people to grow and in which places.  So when you put all of that together and you look at how you're going to market, you're really limiting in some places, the ability to grow your business with your intent of being not growing in nonprofitable segments.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. That's helpful. And I should assume then that, that would be a very material impact on loss ratio as we go into the back half of the year?\nThomas Wilson: I don't think you should assume very material. I mean, the first, it's subject to anybody's -- underwriting actions, Andrew, won't get us to where we need to go. We need to raise prices, cut our expenses. Those are the big drivers. This is helpful.  And I'd like to say to our team, look, anybody can give it away, so like there's no sense writing business and knowing you're going to lose money out whatever. So this is more about managing long-term profitability than what it would do for the combined ratio in the second half of the year.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. And then just looking backwards a little bit and a lot of your competitors that their rate increases have been all over the place, and I think you got what about 2.5% across the whole book last quarter. What was the thinking going into that? Why not a lot more rate? Was it precluded by the fact that 20% of the book is in California and New York, and it's a lot more difficult? But maybe just rewinding back a little bit, why not pushing for a lot more rate 4 or 5 months ago?\nThomas Wilson: Well, I address part of that with the comparison of Progressive, but let me just address that first, the philosophical concept. We are raising prices as fast as we can, everywhere we can. So we're up 6.1% in 6 months of this year, which is -- would have been equal to maybe even our highest year in a long period of time. So we're -- and we expect to get at least that much in the second half. So there wasn't any thinking of let's dial down to 2.5%. It's let's get everything we can, everywhere we can.  It obviously does depend on -- if you don't get anything in California, as Glenn said, that's 12% of your stuff of your total book, so that you got to pick it up by getting the right price in other places or just getting smaller in those places. So it doesn't impact your profitability as much.  As it relates to our competitors, I think, again, everyone's got their own story. We have our own story inside National General is different than the Allstate brand is -- it's related to Progressive. Their frequency was up about 10 -- almost 10 points more than ours in 2021. So you would expect them to raise their prices faster and higher than we did because at the beginning of the year, we were still earning a very attractive combined ratio.  So I think everyone has their own story. What I would leave you with is that like we're completely committed to getting a combined ratio consistent with where we've been in the past. We've been able to run our business for a long time in the mid-90s, and even when the industry has been a lot higher than that and we see no change in the competitive situation, the regulatory environment or our capabilities that lead us to conclude that, that's not possible.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: I want to touch on your higher physical damage loss development, Slide 6. Just wondering, in your transformative growth initiative, I presume you cut clean staff. Do you feel like you're adequate staff in claims where you can close claims in a timely fashion? Maybe you could talk about how you're trying to speed up close rates?\nThomas Wilson: Let me -- Glenn, if you'll talk about what we're doing in claims from an operating standpoint to deal with a higher inflationary environment, leveraging our relationships and getting purchase contracts, and then Mario can talk about the difference between property damage, which is amounts that we have to pay to other people for accidents that our customers help create to how we look at collision. And Tracy, the change in the prior year reserve stuff was really on that first category. And so Mario can talk about how that flows through the system.\nGlenn Shapiro: So yes. So I'll start with -- let me just emphatically say we are not behind on claims staff, and we are not behind on claims. Our pending looks good. And we're in good shape there. The expenses that we took out of the claims process, the team has done a really terrific job of automating processes, creating good self-service capabilities, using a lot of virtual estimating capability. With the slowdown we talked about in the system is really external, and everybody is dealing with this part of it. And this would be uniform across the industry.  So, for example, shop capacity is way down. The staffing level in body shops across the repair industry is down to the point where there's been a 33% decline in the number of hours worked per car per day. So you think about a car sitting in a shop and historically is 4 hours a day, it got work done, now it's 3 hours a day or a little less than 3 hours a day.  So it's moved materially on that. Not surprisingly, the converse of that is that the average car time in a shop has doubled, and the average time to get a car into a shop has more than doubled. So you put all of those together and consumers are, frankly, just choosing to hold on to the check and wait to fix their drivable car until a time they think they can get it back in some reasonable time.  And so we're seeing a way elongated repair cycle that then you get your supplements later and you just have a different dynamic in the way the financials are coming through. And it's -- like I said in the prepared remarks, we had planned for it being about 40% greater than any point prior, and it turned out to be even higher than that with the way it delayed coming through. So I just didn't want the question to miss the chance to tell you, it is not claim staffing. We've got plenty of staff, and our team does a terrific job on it.\nThomas Wilson: Well, in fact, Glenn, you're also doing some stuff and parts buying and other things that mitigate the inflationary aspects, right?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes, absolutely. So using our scale as a company, we've doubled down on some of our parts suppliers, and this is both in home and auto, by the way, where we become a large and in some cases, the largest in the industry buyer of certain materials, whether it's parts in auto or roofing and homeowners or flooring, and we get the benefit of those broader relationships and trends.  We've also doubled down on our direct repair shop, network in auto, so that we can get our customers access to more shops that can take their car and we have a better one-to-one relationship with that network and are able to control costs in that way.\nThomas Wilson: And Mario, why don't you talk about a reserve release piece?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. So I guess -- just a couple of points I think are worth making before I jump into -- to that. First of all, at the end of any reporting period, we believe, based on our processes that our reserves are adequate. That's certainly the case at the end of the second quarter as we work our way what are very comprehensive and thorough processes to estimate reserves, taking into account all the data and inputs both in terms of internal and external data that we have. So I guess that's the place I'd start.  Well, Tracy, your question was on physical damage development specifically, which is different than historically because these tend to be pretty short-tail claims in the past. And as Tom mentioned, they're really -- they show up principally in 2 coverages: collision and property damage.  Collision is first-party coverage. There are customers. We're fixing their cars. A claim gets reported, it's open. It may be subject to the same delays that Glenn talked about in terms of body shops, waiting periods, certainly the same inflationary factors. But we have the claim, we pay the claim, we move on.  Property damage is a third-party coverage. So just to remind you, it's another carrier's customer. And oftentimes, we get notice of that claim and the payout on that claim are subrogation demands we get from a third-party carrier. And what we've seen is, as Glenn talked about, lack of capacity and auto repair shops, coupled with the inflation factors we've been talking about as well as changes in consumer claiming behavior. A lot of consumers are waiting oftentimes months to get their cars repaired whether that's because they can't get in the queue or they can't get an appointment to get it repaired, but it's just taking longer.  And what that -- what all those factors are showing up as is a much longer tail and property damage on those third-party sub road demand from other carriers. And that is the physical damage strengthening that we reported in the quarter, much of that was in PD, and you see that on the chart that we showed on Page 6 of the presentation. In terms of the dollar amounts getting paid after the end of the calendar year are much more significant than we've seen in the past.  The thing I'd leave you with is because we have this information on kind of longer tail expectations, we're taking that into account as we establish 2022 severity levels. So we're certainly factoring that into the severity increases that we talked about earlier.\nTracy Benguigui: So just a follow-up on that. Your auto underlying loss ratio of 79.6% was up 4.7 points sequentially. So should I think that part of that was raising your loss picks from everything you said, but was there also a component that you trued up your first quarter loss ratio since that will show up as a prior year, it's in the same accident year?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, Tracy. So as you know, when we increased severity, which we did slightly this quarter relative to where we talked about our severity trends last quarter, that gets applied to claim counts for the entire year. So there is a catch-up component that would have been reflected in the first quarter, had we had perfect information in the first quarter.\nTracy Benguigui: And would you be able to quantify what that first quarter true-up would have looked like, just so we have a better sense of what's the right starting point when thinking about your loss ratio?\nThomas Wilson: Tracy, I think you should just think about looking at the combined ratio by quarter, it does bounce around. There's seasonality, there's driving in the summer, there's all kinds of stuff. So I would -- I think look at it on a year basis. We did it 1 year -- 1 quarter last year when it was a pretty big number. It's not that big as we're looking at this quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: I was wondering thinking about on the home insurance side of the house. Do we see the same sort of regulatory pressure in the home insurance business that we do in the auto because presumably, we have inflationary issues there and presumably, you need to get rate there as well to offset those issues?\nThomas Wilson: Paul, the increase in home insurance, you saw is 15% year-over-year. So we don't -- we're getting the rates we think we need in those areas. The underlying assumption there is we have regulatory pressure in auto insurance. And as Glenn mentioned, we have good relationships with the regulation when the price of picking cars, they got it. So there are a few states. And so we've been waiting to get a rate increase that was agreed to with State of California over a year ago on homeowners, and that has yet to come through. So it tends to be more of a state-specific issue than a broad-based regulatory pushback. Glenn, anything you want to add?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. The only thing I would add there is it's that base level of premium we're getting that isn't great. It's the inflationary factors that really keeps us going in that space. It's just a different type of products. Home values go up, and replacement costs go up. Cars, other than recent history, tend to not go up. So it's a different type of product in that way.  So when you look at an average premium up over 13% year-over-year, it's a mix of rate in that. But to your point, Paul, like we've got to get rate there, it's not as heavy as it is in auto, but we deal with the same regulators.  And I always go back to, it's the math. Like we're not making up these rates, and they're not looking to make up a reason not to do the rates in most cases. It's the math. Does the math support a trend that says you need rate? And we've been successful in that space.\nPaul Newsome: No, I was just curious because obviously getting rate in home is different than auto is that inflation factors there and such. I just want to know if the dynamics is -- so really any different in the improvement of the rate there as well. And on the home side, is -- are you implementing some of the same underwriting criteria changes? Or are they materially different than what we've talked about from that volumes changes this quarter on the auto side?\nThomas Wilson: Glenn, do you want to take that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. No, we're -- I would say it is materially different. We like where we are in homeowners. That's obviously not universal. I mean, there's -- from a risk standpoint, from a catastrophe-prone standpoint, everything, there's obviously a lot of underwriting we do. It's one of the strengths we have. And homeowners is that we know how to underwrite this business to make money over time and protect a good balance set of customers in such a way that, that portfolio works.  But we are not in an equal or even that similar position in homeowners as auto right now in spite of the inflation. We're in a very good position to continue to write and grow homeowners.\nThomas Wilson: Jonathan, let's just do 1 last question.\nOperator: Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America.\nJoshua Shanker: When I think of Allstate, I think you guys are second to none understanding the long-term value bundler that the Progressive people call the Robinson. And when anyone says they're going after that Allstate customer, I'm very skeptical at the level of success they'll have. On the other hand, you guys bought NatGen to go into nonstandard in a bigger way. You guys have come back and forth over 20 years in that a number of times. And if you look at Progressive, they're losing their SAMs at this point in time. Whether they're unprofitable or whatnot, that they are going somewhere.  And when you talk about having 1,000 basis points of better margin in NatGen and it's growing, how confident are you given that that's not your legacy business that you understand that those aren't Progressive customers that they can't make work coming onto your books?\nThomas Wilson: Let me see if I can deal with that. So I'm going to go up in a minute. So it's really the question of we. And so who is we, Josh? So we as now Allstate and NatGen, as opposed to we was Allstate without experience in nonstandard.  So you may remember when we got started on NatGen, I went to Barry Karfunkel and said, hey, Barry, I got this problem, I'm not making any money in the independent agent business, and I'm not really in the nonstandard business. So I either have to get out of the business or try to fix it, I had trouble fixing it. So I've decided I'd like to get out of it, but I'm going to get out of it first by buying you, and then your team can fix our business, and that's exactly what's played out.  Peter Randell and that team are really good at nonstandard. They know their business well. They run separately. They have separate pricing, separate claims, they know that business well. And then they took our Encompass business, which was more a standard business, and they're folding that in.  And so we think we have a great opportunity to expand in the independent agent channel, not just for the nonstandard piece but in what's affectionately called, I guess, the Robinson is quite progressive because we're really in that segment. And we think there's a great opportunity for us to compete there.\nJoshua Shanker: And so I just -- I'll make this the last part of the question. You say who as we, and you're making it seeing that National General is running separately in some ways from Allstate. Of course, you're in charge and the buck stops with you, Tom, how comp are you that you understand the underwriting going on there that you know that what we see right now is results that you're very comfortable and proud of?\nThomas Wilson: Yes. It's not that hard to understand, Josh. It's more difficult to build a set of business processes, policy documents, procedures and relationships with agents to note. So they -- for example, they were on something called the WAR Score where they look at every individual agent and see what kind of business they're getting for them.  So it isn't -- like if it's got wheels on it, and it's got losses and that stuff is not that complicated. What's really complicated is building the business model to do it. And we are highly confident that they know what they're doing.  All right. First, as we move forward, we clearly, based on your comments and the amount of time, we're focused on auto insurance. We're going to get those margins up. We still got to make sure we make good money in homeowners, expand on our Protection services and at the same time, rebuild its digital insurer called transformer growth of that when we get margins where we are, we can hit the accelerator hard on profitable growth and drive more shareholder value.  So thank you all, and we'll talk to you on investments in September.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Thomas Wilson",
            "content": "Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time with Allstate today. Let's start on Slide 2.  So Allstate's strategy to increase shareholder value has 2 components: increase personal property-liability market share and expand Protection services, which are shown in the 2 ovals on the left. We're building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution we transformed the growth. We're also diversifying our business by expanding protection offers and by leveraging the Allstate brand, customer base capabilities and expanding distribution.  On the panel on the right, in the second quarter, we made progress executing this strategy, while we continue to implement a comprehensive strategy to improve profitability. That includes broadly raising auto and home insurance rates. In the second half of 2022, we plan to file for rate increases in excess of the increases implemented in the first half of this year, which were 6.1% of Allstate brand countrywide premiums. We're also reducing expenses on advertising and growth investments. Underwriting guidelines have been and will be changed to reduce new business volume, where we're not earning adequate returns. And we're also executing claims operating actions to manage loss cost in a high inflationary environment. These actions will likely have a negative impact on policy growth.  And now while the current environment requires a huge focus on margin improvement, we continue to advance our transformative growth strategy where profitability -- when profitability levels are acceptable we'll have a business model to capture market share.  The Protection Services businesses are generating profitable growth, although earnings declined slightly this quarter as we invest in that growth. Given the negative impact of inflation on the auto insurance business, as you know, beginning late last year, we reduced the bond portfolio duration to lower exposure to higher interest rates, which helped mitigate the reduction in bond valuations by approximately $1.3 billion in the first half of 2022. Our strong capital position enabled us to maintain high cash returns to shareholders in this environment.  Moving to Slide 3, let's review second quarter performance in more detail. Total revenues decreased 3.4% in the prior year quarter, despite property liability premiums earned increasing 8.6%, which reflected higher average premiums and policy growth. Higher loss costs in the current report year and upward loss reserve development of $411 million in the prior report years resulted in a property liability recorded combined ratio of 107.9 in the second quarter.  Net investment income of $562 million was 42% below the prior year quarter since performance-based income was exceptional in the prior year. Net losses on investments and derivatives were $733 million in the quarter as lower valuations and equity investments and losses on fixed income sales, which were only partially offset by the derivative gains associated with the bond portfolio duration shortening. The combination of these factors led to a net loss of $1.4 billion in the second quarter and an adjusted net loss of $209 million or $0.76 per diluted share.  The adjusted net income return on equity was 6.9% over the last 12 months, which is obviously unacceptable from our standpoint. It's substantially below the levels we achieved at this time last year, but we remain committed to achieving our long-term returns on equity of between 14% and 17%.  Now let me turn it over to Glenn to talk -- walk through our property liability results in more detail. Greg, this is Tom. I'll do a bit of overviewing. Glenn, you can jump right in. First, Greg, as you know, we don't give perspective -- earnings estimates in order to give perspective line-by-line. We would expect future loss costs to go up, like we don't -- and we're booking to have them go up in the future. And we also, as we mentioned, expect to take increase in rates.  With that, Glenn, do you want to provide some more perspective on both the trends you're seeing historically in loss cost and then what you're -- where we're thinking about -- how you're thinking about rate increases. Greg, I'll let Glenn give you the specifics there. But it isn't just to like negotiate. And I'm reading into your statement. I know you're not really saying that, but it's also to just maintain our loss cost. Like we just -- even if we get a rate increase, there may be certain cells or certain segments of the state that are less -- where we have less profitability than we want. So it's also about managing profitability.  Glenn, why don't you give some specifics on that? Jonathan, we didn't hear him. I don't know if you did or I don't know, Andrew, if you're on mute or not, but we didn't hear him. Now we can hear you. Now we can't. Andrew, maybe you want to question to Mark, and he can ask it for you, if you want. But let's move on. David, I'll make a comment and then Glenn can -- if there's anything you want to add, you might jump in. First, we are fully committed to increasing rates necessary to get our combined ratio down to the target levels that Glenn talked about, that obviously bounces around by quarter.  And what you saw is what we got implemented in the second quarter, in the early part of your question, you said submitting as in forward-looking, that's not what we're submitting. What you saw in that release is just what got implemented. We're obviously in conversations with regulators when you have these kind of increases continuously.  So there are some states where Glenn's team chooses to go down and meet with the regulators, explain the numbers and then submit it and so we feel good about where we're headed there.  Glenn, anything you want to add to that? David, it's an astute question, and let me -- but let me take it up a level and then get Glenn to jump into NatGen versus the Allstate brand. Because many of you have also written and asked about like how do you stand versus competitors and stuff on that? So let me just take it up and deal with that, and then we'll go into the specifics.  So like you, we always look at different comparisons, whether it's internal or external, to get a sense for our performance. That said, when it's external, it tends to be more directional versus our variance analysis because of the differences in strategies and particularly it gives you got different strategies, different risk profiles, different state mix.  It's better if you look at the long-term results rather than quarterly numbers, particularly when you're using percentage changes on a quarter-by-quarter.  That said, the numbers are the numbers, and you need to understand them and evaluate them. First thing I would say is when you look at -- most of you have asked about Progressive, they're a really strong competitors, so we have great respect to them. As it relates to auto insurance over a long period of time, Allstate, Progressive and GEICO have all had attractive returns.  And we're all dealing with the impact of what I would say, a wide swings in frequency and severity for auto claims, in particular that's driven by the pandemic and then the related inflationary impacts on tower repairs and prices. They did report, that is Progressive, a better combined ratio than us this quarter as they began raising prices earlier in 2021.  But again, we don't know why, like we're not them. But they did have different trends in frequency both last year and this year. So and of course, claims statistics are different for everybody and sometimes people change them how they count them over time. But the numbers I see are that in 2020, we both had frequency declines from 2019, that was reflecting the impact of shutting down the economy. So we were down -- in collision, we were down 26%, and they were down, I think, about 23%, 24%.  Last year, their collision frequency increased by 26%, whereas ours increased by only 18%. So you would expect them to raise prices more than we raise them. This year, they're down in frequency, and we're up. So you would expect our combined ratio to be higher than theirs.  It's hard to say why these short-term trends are different. But Glenn will talk, it may be that they have a relatively small share of the customer statement that they call the Robinson. And so the comparison to NatGen will be helpful for you to see how that's different. It could be state mix. It could be a whole bunch of other things. So I can't intuit exactly the results.  And so Glenn will go through that risk mix and show you how that impacts the different results.  As it relates to the strength of the business model, though, and your strategy, I think it's also worthwhile looking at other lines. And as we talked about on our last call, Allstate is an industry leader in homeowners with very attractive combined ratios. The reported combined ratio this quarter, again, is higher, as Glenn talked about, than it typically is in the second quarter.  On a longer-term basis, though, we've obviously done quite well.  To put that in perspective, if we had 112.5 combined ratio on our homeowners business, last year, our underwriting income would have been about $1.6 billion lower than it actually was, and that's particularly hard on a business that requires twice as much capital as auto insurance.  As it relates to commitment to profitability, speed, precision, we dramatically reshaped that business, which we took you through. So our business models tend to be good and precise, we tend to look at both lines of business and see how we're doing.  With that, Glenn, do you want to talk about NatGen versus the Allstate rate? We can. Glenn can give you the items. I think we probably won't be able to give you an attribution on what that will do for this year's combined ratio. Glenn, what do you -- do you want to take that? I don't think you should assume very material. I mean, the first, it's subject to anybody's -- underwriting actions, Andrew, won't get us to where we need to go. We need to raise prices, cut our expenses. Those are the big drivers. This is helpful.  And I'd like to say to our team, look, anybody can give it away, so like there's no sense writing business and knowing you're going to lose money out whatever. So this is more about managing long-term profitability than what it would do for the combined ratio in the second half of the year. Well, I address part of that with the comparison of Progressive, but let me just address that first, the philosophical concept. We are raising prices as fast as we can, everywhere we can. So we're up 6.1% in 6 months of this year, which is -- would have been equal to maybe even our highest year in a long period of time. So we're -- and we expect to get at least that much in the second half. So there wasn't any thinking of let's dial down to 2.5%. It's let's get everything we can, everywhere we can.  It obviously does depend on -- if you don't get anything in California, as Glenn said, that's 12% of your stuff of your total book, so that you got to pick it up by getting the right price in other places or just getting smaller in those places. So it doesn't impact your profitability as much.  As it relates to our competitors, I think, again, everyone's got their own story. We have our own story inside National General is different than the Allstate brand is -- it's related to Progressive. Their frequency was up about 10 -- almost 10 points more than ours in 2021. So you would expect them to raise their prices faster and higher than we did because at the beginning of the year, we were still earning a very attractive combined ratio.  So I think everyone has their own story. What I would leave you with is that like we're completely committed to getting a combined ratio consistent with where we've been in the past. We've been able to run our business for a long time in the mid-90s, and even when the industry has been a lot higher than that and we see no change in the competitive situation, the regulatory environment or our capabilities that lead us to conclude that, that's not possible. Let me -- Glenn, if you'll talk about what we're doing in claims from an operating standpoint to deal with a higher inflationary environment, leveraging our relationships and getting purchase contracts, and then Mario can talk about the difference between property damage, which is amounts that we have to pay to other people for accidents that our customers help create to how we look at collision. And Tracy, the change in the prior year reserve stuff was really on that first category. And so Mario can talk about how that flows through the system. Well, in fact, Glenn, you're also doing some stuff and parts buying and other things that mitigate the inflationary aspects, right? And Mario, why don't you talk about a reserve release piece? Tracy, I think you should just think about looking at the combined ratio by quarter, it does bounce around. There's seasonality, there's driving in the summer, there's all kinds of stuff. So I would -- I think look at it on a year basis. We did it 1 year -- 1 quarter last year when it was a pretty big number. It's not that big as we're looking at this quarter. Paul, the increase in home insurance, you saw is 15% year-over-year. So we don't -- we're getting the rates we think we need in those areas. The underlying assumption there is we have regulatory pressure in auto insurance. And as Glenn mentioned, we have good relationships with the regulation when the price of picking cars, they got it. So there are a few states. And so we've been waiting to get a rate increase that was agreed to with State of California over a year ago on homeowners, and that has yet to come through. So it tends to be more of a state-specific issue than a broad-based regulatory pushback. Glenn, anything you want to add? Glenn, do you want to take that? Jonathan, let's just do 1 last question. Let me see if I can deal with that. So I'm going to go up in a minute. So it's really the question of we. And so who is we, Josh? So we as now Allstate and NatGen, as opposed to we was Allstate without experience in nonstandard.  So you may remember when we got started on NatGen, I went to Barry Karfunkel and said, hey, Barry, I got this problem, I'm not making any money in the independent agent business, and I'm not really in the nonstandard business. So I either have to get out of the business or try to fix it, I had trouble fixing it. So I've decided I'd like to get out of it, but I'm going to get out of it first by buying you, and then your team can fix our business, and that's exactly what's played out.  Peter Randell and that team are really good at nonstandard. They know their business well. They run separately. They have separate pricing, separate claims, they know that business well. And then they took our Encompass business, which was more a standard business, and they're folding that in.  And so we think we have a great opportunity to expand in the independent agent channel, not just for the nonstandard piece but in what's affectionately called, I guess, the Robinson is quite progressive because we're really in that segment. And we think there's a great opportunity for us to compete there. Yes. It's not that hard to understand, Josh. It's more difficult to build a set of business processes, policy documents, procedures and relationships with agents to note. So they -- for example, they were on something called the WAR Score where they look at every individual agent and see what kind of business they're getting for them.  So it isn't -- like if it's got wheels on it, and it's got losses and that stuff is not that complicated. What's really complicated is building the business model to do it. And we are highly confident that they know what they're doing.  All right. First, as we move forward, we clearly, based on your comments and the amount of time, we're focused on auto insurance. We're going to get those margins up. We still got to make sure we make good money in homeowners, expand on our Protection services and at the same time, rebuild its digital insurer called transformer growth of that when we get margins where we are, we can hit the accelerator hard on profitable growth and drive more shareholder value.  So thank you all, and we'll talk to you on investments in September."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom. Let's start by reviewing underwriting profitability on Slide 4. The underwriting results reflect the high level of inflation, which is increasing severity leading to an underlying combined ratio of 93.4 for the second quarter and a recorded combined ratio of 107.9, which is shown in the chart on the left.  The chart on the right compares last year's recorded combined ratio of 95.7 to this year's second quarter. A higher auto insurance underlying loss ratio drove 8.6 of the 12.2 point increase as claims severity has been increasing faster than earned rate increases.  The other large negative impact was from prior year reserve strengthening this quarter, which I'll cover in a few minutes. The one positive impact on there was the 1.7 points from expense reductions.  Let's move to Slide 5 and talk about profitability and rising loss costs in more detail. As you know, we have a target combined ratio for auto insurance in the mid-90s. And you can see on the chart, which shows the combined ratio by year and then the first 2 quarters of this year, that we have a long history of meeting or exceeding those targets, which is supported by our pricing sophistication, underwriting, claims expertise and expense management.  Now in there, you'll see 2020 was an outlier because we had much better than target results than due to some of the early pandemic frequency impacts. And as we move from that environment to the high inflationary environment we're in today, incurred claims severities increased the underlying auto combined ratio of 102.1 for the quarter and 100.5 year-to-date.  Auto non-catastrophe prior year reserve strengthening in the second quarter totaled $275 million, which is primarily physical damage and injury coverages. The most significant impact, though, on the combined ratio was report year incurred severity for collision, property damage and bodily injury claims, which increased by 16%, 12% and 9%, respectively, over the average of the full year 2021 incurred. Because the costs were rising rapidly during 2021, the quarter-to-quarter increase comparison is even greater. And frequency also went up about 5 to 7 points, but it's still well below pre-pandemic levels.  So let's go to Slide 6, and we'll go deeper into the prior year physical damage for reserve development. The chart on the left shows used car values. They began to rise in 2020. And if you go back looking from the beginning of 2019 to current, used car prices have gone up more than 60% and continue to stay at an elevated level.  At the same time, OEM parts and labor rates have increased during the first half of this year, which causes severity increases for coverages like collision and property damage. Now we anticipated that those trends and the delays that are taking cars a long time to be repaired right now would increase the amount of claim payments we made on 2021 losses after the end of the year, even though these are relatively short-duration claims.  The chart on the right shows gross paid losses for physical damage coverages for the 6 months after the end of the calendar year. Now our expectation for paid losses for 2021 claims from months 13 to 18 was that it would be about $1.25 billion, which you can see from the chart is about 40% above the prior year. You can see that from the dash line on the far right bar compared to the bars to the left of it.  But at the end of the second quarter, the actual paid losses were $1.48 billion, which exceeded even our higher estimate by $230 million and is a large driver of the prior year reserve increases. All other non-catastrophe prior year development, primarily from injury, commercial auto and homeowners, totaled $268 million in the quarter.  Let's go to Slide 7 and discuss how higher auto insurance rates have been and will be implemented to improve profitability. Since the beginning of the year, we've implemented broad rate increases across the country, as shown on the map, at 9 states where we had increases over 10%, and auto rates have been increased in 48 locations, inclusive of Canadian provinces. Those rate increases are expected to increase Allstate brand annualized written premium by 6.1%.  Now we have not been able to get adequate rate in New York or any increase in rate in California. New York represents about 9% of our auto premium. And the implemented rate there was, we leveraged the annual flex filings process there. And it gave us less than 5% rate in our current indicated indication there is significantly higher than that to get to an adequate return.  Similarly, in California, which represents about 12% of our auto premium, we recently filed in the second quarter, a 6.9% increase, which again is significantly below the overall rate need there. In states markets, risk segments or channels where we cannot achieve an adequate price for the risk, we're implementing more restrictive underwriting actions and reducing new business as needed until adequate levels of rate are approved.  Let's move to Slide 8, and we'll look at how these rate increases are impacting and will impact the combined ratio for auto insurance. What you see here illustrates our path to target profitability, along with the magnitude of actions we've already taken and what's required prospectively.  Starting on the left. Through the first 6 months of the year, our auto insurance recorded combined ratio is 105, and that's shown in the blue bar. To start with, we normalized that by removing the impact of prior year reserve increases and going to a 5-year average on catastrophe losses, that improves the combined ratio by 2.5 points represented by the first green bar.  The second green bar reflects the estimated impact of rate actions already implemented when fully earned into premium. So these are already implemented actions that are in market and renewing on policies. They total an additional $1.7 billion of effective premium across Allstate and national general brands. Those will be earned over the coming quarters and fully earned by the end of 2023.  Now of course, loss costs will continue to increase, whether it's inflationary impacts on severity or higher frequency, which would increase the combined ratio from what I just described there. So prospective rate increases must exceed the loss cost increases that come to achieve our target returns.  Now everything I just described, combined with our non-rate actions such as reducing new business and expenses, gives us a track where we expect to achieve our target combined ratio in the mid-90s in auto insurance. Now the timing of that will be largely dependent on the relative increases and pace of these increases in premium and loss costs.  So on Page 9, we'll take a look again at our industry-leading homeowners business. As you know, a significant portion of our customers, bundle home and auto insurance, and that improves the retention and the overall economics of both products. We have a differentiated ecosystem in homeowners. That includes a differentiated product, underwriting, reinsurance, claim capabilities, and we discussed a lot of those capabilities in our last special topic call.  Our long-term underwriting results show the strength of the system. Our 5-year average reported combined ratio is 91.9, as shown in the chart on the left. And that produced $3.3 billion of underwriting profit since 2017, while the industry lost over $20 billion in that same period.  Now our second quarter combined ratio and most second quarter combined ratios have historically been higher than full year results, primarily due to catastrophes. And second quarter this year was at 106.9, which reflected again higher catastrophes and 1.7 points of unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve estimates.  Our year-to-date recorded combined ratio for home is 95.8. Now homeowners insurance is certainly not immune to the inflationary environment we're in, and we continue to see increases in labor and material costs. To combat that, our product has sophisticated pricing features that respond to changes in replacement values, and we've taken rate.  If you see on the chart on the right that shows some of the key Allstate brand homeowners operating statistics, we've grown net written premium by 15.2% from the prior year. And that's on a policy base that we grew of 1.2% in the second quarter, where our Allstate agents remain in a really good position to broaden customer relationships.  So as you've heard me say several times and certainly in our last special topic call, we're really well positioned at homeowners to not only maintain the competitive advantage we have, but to grow that line of business.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mario. Sure. Greg, on the loss cost piece of it, I know there's been some opinion out there that maybe the worst is behind us and the inflation will slow or just listening to other calls out there. We're not sure of that, and we certainly want to have the rate outpace the loss trends.  One thing I'll say is when you look at our frequency trend, I think this is a unique time in history where typically frequency is harder to predict than severity. And I think the opposite is true right now. Our frequency has been really, really steady. You look at it from the low points of the pandemic up to where it is now, it is just steadily crept back up but has leveled out in that creep, and we have good data and expectation that it remains below the pre-pandemic levels, but continues to rise slightly as it has.  And on the other side, severity, it's a big wild card out there, I think, in all industries right now as to how long and how severe inflation runs with the actions of the Fed and anything else out there, we're taking the conservative viewpoint that we need a lot more rate in order to offset that.  So I mentioned in the prepared remarks, a couple of places where we're having trouble on it, and we're working through it. But broadly, I will tell you, it's gone very well in that the regulators we work with, good relationships across the country, and we're getting some meaningful rates going through the pipeline right now, and they understand.  I mean the math is on our side, and we need to get those rates in to offset those future rate trends because as the slide depicts, if you froze time and loss costs didn't move, we would earn our way right to the mid-90s combined ratio over the coming quarters, but that isn't the case. We need additional rate to offset those loss trends. Yes. And I'll just build on that because it's exactly right. It really is -- it's segments within states, it's markets within states, and it's even channels. I mean look at the fact that right now, National General is performing quite well, both from a growth and a profit standpoint. And so we can position based on where we can be profitable, whether it's channel, market, segment of risk, and that's kind of how we're thinking about new business.  We -- to put it very simply, we don't want to write new business that we're not profitable on. And it's not as simple as looking at, you can see in our disclosures, the number of states where we're above 100 or above 96. And because it's -- that's the rearview mirror.  The prospective view is where we've already gotten rates. And in some of the states that we feel good about the price we're putting on for new business and we'll grow in those.  To answer your specific question, New Jersey would be another place that we're working hard on and need to get more rate. But the vast majority of states across the country, we've been working through, and we're in good shape in. Yes. I would just add, it really is about timing and about which states go through. So like if you look at the amount we filed per state, we really haven't backed off at all, David, it is the states that went through in that cycle. It just -- they aren't as large. And so the countrywide impact when you do a medium or smaller state population-wise is lesser than the big states.  We have some very large states going through the pipeline right now. And I think you'll see that timing level itself out, and it's why we're able to say to you that we are seeking more rate in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. We have some very large states with meaningful rate increases going through. Yes, I will. Well, David, you're getting a good detailed answer there from Tom and after me, you like hit the daily double here because it is a really good question and an important one.  I want to take you back and kind of look at it over the 18 months that we've owned NatGen and since the closing of that deal, and it's a good time frame to use because 18 months is the time it takes to earn out the full annualized premium changes also.  So you go back to first quarter 2021, and this would be true, by the way, not only of comparison of Allstate brand and NatGen but Allstate to other competitors, like Tom was talking about. Allstate was running a combined ratio about 10 points lower. And the reason for that was the frequency was lower, frequency on more nonstandard or near nonstandard business came back much quicker as people needed to use their cars to make a living, and there was just a difference between different books of business.  And so as a result, the good news was for the Allstate brand was that is a really low combined ratio. It's around 80. The bad news is in the current state would be to say that, well, when you're running at that level, you need to take rates now. I mean you can't sustain and even in some places, require you to refile your rates, you can't sustain that level that far below target combined ratios.  And National General, on the other hand, was still taking a maintenance level of rates up over that period of time. So now flash forward to today, their frequency down while all states is up. And then you've got a higher average earned premium going through.  And I mentioned before the $1.7 billion of premium that we have already in the system, not only filed but approved and already like renewing on policies that hasn't been earned yet, we've actually only earned 15% of the premium that's been raised through this cycle. So we get 85% of it out there still left to be earned, whereas National General is earning off of a base, plus they didn't have the hole to fill, so to speak, of the negative rates that, again, we appropriately took because when you're running an 80 combined ratio, but you got to fill that up to get back to par and then go up from there. So there's a difference in the average earned premium that's a few points to the differences, one.  Two, there's a few points difference on the frequency levels right now. Three, and this is a really important one when you're looking across companies is the risks are different and the policies are different. So as you think about the inflationary factors and how they're hitting different policies, National General, even inside their own book, it's really fascinating.  If you look at their full coverage policies versus their liability-only policies, they're running about 10 points different on trend in their combined ratio. Because if you think about a liability-only policy, you don't have collision, which is the highest inflationary trend of any coverage right now, one. Two, you tend to have very low liability limits, so on things like, let's say, property damage. If you have a state minimum of $10,000 of property-liability coverage and you hit somebody's car and you total it, whether it's before the inflation factors that were hitting us or after, you're probably just going to pay that $10,000. And the inflation, there's a computation to that inflation. Whereas when you typically have $100,000 limits, you're bearing the full weight of the change in the value of vehicles.  So looking at all these components, we see just a lot of different ways, and I didn't even get into state mix, which is another one, a lot of different ways that the trends move differently. The nice thing is having acquired NatGen, and it's performing really well, it's growing nicely, it's profitable, is that it's really acting right now as a bit of a diversification on that auto trend and gives us a place where we are able and willing to grow. Yes. So I'll give you a few like you've got underwriting actions where we segment the business and we segment our pricing to where, as Tom said earlier, it isn't just about, geez, we're going to not write new business in this market, let's say, it's, well, we're profitable in these segments and not those other ones. So we're going to change the segmentation of our pricing, would be one.  Another would be, we changed the down payment on policies and expect that there's a change in the flow of business at times with that. Certainly, the targeting of marketing is a really big one that I think can be underplayed, but we're pretty sophisticated in how we go to market.  So when and where are we putting up banner ads when people are searching for auto insurance, which risk categories, which markets? And flat out, we've taken a lot of marketing dollars out right now. We're just reducing the marketing that we're doing: one, it will improve expense; two, it will lower the new business flow and allow us to more quickly get back to profitability; and then the last one I'll say is the sales incentives that are out there with our agents about how we're incentivizing people to grow and in which places.  So when you put all of that together and you look at how you're going to market, you're really limiting in some places, the ability to grow your business with your intent of being not growing in nonprofitable segments. So yes. So I'll start with -- let me just emphatically say we are not behind on claims staff, and we are not behind on claims. Our pending looks good. And we're in good shape there. The expenses that we took out of the claims process, the team has done a really terrific job of automating processes, creating good self-service capabilities, using a lot of virtual estimating capability. With the slowdown we talked about in the system is really external, and everybody is dealing with this part of it. And this would be uniform across the industry.  So, for example, shop capacity is way down. The staffing level in body shops across the repair industry is down to the point where there's been a 33% decline in the number of hours worked per car per day. So you think about a car sitting in a shop and historically is 4 hours a day, it got work done, now it's 3 hours a day or a little less than 3 hours a day.  So it's moved materially on that. Not surprisingly, the converse of that is that the average car time in a shop has doubled, and the average time to get a car into a shop has more than doubled. So you put all of those together and consumers are, frankly, just choosing to hold on to the check and wait to fix their drivable car until a time they think they can get it back in some reasonable time.  And so we're seeing a way elongated repair cycle that then you get your supplements later and you just have a different dynamic in the way the financials are coming through. And it's -- like I said in the prepared remarks, we had planned for it being about 40% greater than any point prior, and it turned out to be even higher than that with the way it delayed coming through. So I just didn't want the question to miss the chance to tell you, it is not claim staffing. We've got plenty of staff, and our team does a terrific job on it. Yes, absolutely. So using our scale as a company, we've doubled down on some of our parts suppliers, and this is both in home and auto, by the way, where we become a large and in some cases, the largest in the industry buyer of certain materials, whether it's parts in auto or roofing and homeowners or flooring, and we get the benefit of those broader relationships and trends.  We've also doubled down on our direct repair shop, network in auto, so that we can get our customers access to more shops that can take their car and we have a better one-to-one relationship with that network and are able to control costs in that way. Yes. The only thing I would add there is it's that base level of premium we're getting that isn't great. It's the inflationary factors that really keeps us going in that space. It's just a different type of products. Home values go up, and replacement costs go up. Cars, other than recent history, tend to not go up. So it's a different type of product in that way.  So when you look at an average premium up over 13% year-over-year, it's a mix of rate in that. But to your point, Paul, like we've got to get rate there, it's not as heavy as it is in auto, but we deal with the same regulators.  And I always go back to, it's the math. Like we're not making up these rates, and they're not looking to make up a reason not to do the rates in most cases. It's the math. Does the math support a trend that says you need rate? And we've been successful in that space. Yes. No, we're -- I would say it is materially different. We like where we are in homeowners. That's obviously not universal. I mean, there's -- from a risk standpoint, from a catastrophe-prone standpoint, everything, there's obviously a lot of underwriting we do. It's one of the strengths we have. And homeowners is that we know how to underwrite this business to make money over time and protect a good balance set of customers in such a way that, that portfolio works.  But we are not in an equal or even that similar position in homeowners as auto right now in spite of the inflation. We're in a very good position to continue to write and grow homeowners."

            "content": "Thanks, Glenn. As Tom mentioned, while we are improving profitability, we also continue to invest in the core components of the transformative growth strategy to increase market share in the personal property-liability business.  Slide 10 is the flywheel of growth that we have discussed on earlier calls. Transformative growth is a multiyear initiative designed to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution.  I won't get into all the pieces today, but I want to highlight 2 specific items: first, we remain committed to achieving our adjusted expense ratio goal of 23 by year-end 2024, which represents a 6-point improvement compared to year-end 2018; secondly, in the quarter, we launched beta versions of a new fully digital auto insurance product and sales experience made possible with new technology for relationship initiation and product delivery.  Building these foundational elements will enable us to scale growth when adequate insurance pricing is a tank.  At the same time, the Protection Services businesses, in the lower strategic oval, are growing and increasing shareholder value, as shown on Slide 11.  Revenues, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, increased 8.3% to $629 million in the quarter, primarily driven by Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $43 million for the second quarter of 2022 decreased $13 million compared to the prior year quarter as ongoing investments and growth are being made to position these businesses for future success.  Policies in force did decrease by 1.6%, reflecting expiring Protection Plan warranties and lower retail sales compared to the favorable environment in the prior year quarter.  Moving to Slide 12. Allstate Health and Benefits is also growing. It is also growing an attractive set of businesses that protect millions of policyholders. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual health products to our portfolio, as you can see on the left.  Revenues of $574 million in the second quarter of 2022 increased to 4.6% for the prior year quarter, driven primarily by growth in group and individual health businesses. Adjusted net income of $65 million increased $3 million from the prior year quarter, driven by increased revenue, which was partially offset by a higher benefit ratio, primarily in individual health.  Now let's shift to investments on Slide 13 to review investment performance and the portfolio risk and return position we have taken given higher inflation and the possibility of a recession. Net investment income totaled $562 million in the quarter, which is $412 million below the prior year quarter, as shown in the chart on the left.  Market-based income, shown in blue, was $13 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase in the fixed income portfolio yields, which are now benefiting from investing in yields that are higher than the overall portfolio's current yield. Performance-based income of $236 million, shown in dark blue, was $413 million below with an exceptional quarter in 2021. The performance-based internal rate of return over the last 12 months was 24.6%, which remains above our long-term return expectations. The performance-based portfolio includes private equity as well as a mix of other asset types such as real estate and infrastructure, which diversify our performance in this segment.  In the second quarter, real estate investments had strong performance, including gains on asset sales, while private equity results were lower. As a reminder, our performance-based results are reported based on a 1 quarter lag, so second quarter results reflect March 31 sponsored financial statements, and future returns will reflect market and economic conditions from the prior quarter.  The total portfolio return was negative 2.8% for the quarter and negative 5.6% year-to-date due to higher interest rates and credit spreads, lowering the market value of bonds and a decline in public equity valuations. While these market conditions negatively impacted the market value of the portfolio, it continues to generate operating income. And because of proactive portfolio actions, the results are better than the broad indices with the S&P 500 Index 20% lower and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 10% lower.  The chart on the right illustrates the shift in risk positioning we have executed to protect portfolio value and position us to take advantage of opportunities as conditions evolve. We reduced interest rate risk towards the end of 2021 and into the first quarter through the sale of longer-duration bonds and the use of derivatives. The portfolio duration is shorter than our long-term targets, which has mitigated the negative impact of higher market rates by approximately $1.3 billion this year.  With recession concerns rising, the exposure to recession risk-sensitive assets was also reduced through sales of high-yield bonds, bank loans and public equity. These sales were largely executed prior to the most significant credit spread widening and equity market decline for the end of the quarter, further preserving portfolio value.  Now let's move to Slide 14 to discuss Allstate's strong cash returns to shareholders of $1.9 billion in the first 2 quarters. Over the last year, shares outstanding have been reduced by 8.7%, providing more upside per share as profitability has improved. In addition, there is another $1.8 billion remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase authorization.  Adjusted net income return on equity of 6.9% was below the prior year period, primarily due to lower underwriting income. Achieving our target combined ratios for both auto and homeowners insurance will bring adjusted net income returns on equity back to our long-term target range of 14% to 17%.  With that context, let's open up the line for questions. Yes. So I guess -- just a couple of points I think are worth making before I jump into -- to that. First of all, at the end of any reporting period, we believe, based on our processes that our reserves are adequate. That's certainly the case at the end of the second quarter as we work our way what are very comprehensive and thorough processes to estimate reserves, taking into account all the data and inputs both in terms of internal and external data that we have. So I guess that's the place I'd start.  Well, Tracy, your question was on physical damage development specifically, which is different than historically because these tend to be pretty short-tail claims in the past. And as Tom mentioned, they're really -- they show up principally in 2 coverages: collision and property damage.  Collision is first-party coverage. There are customers. We're fixing their cars. A claim gets reported, it's open. It may be subject to the same delays that Glenn talked about in terms of body shops, waiting periods, certainly the same inflationary factors. But we have the claim, we pay the claim, we move on.  Property damage is a third-party coverage. So just to remind you, it's another carrier's customer. And oftentimes, we get notice of that claim and the payout on that claim are subrogation demands we get from a third-party carrier. And what we've seen is, as Glenn talked about, lack of capacity and auto repair shops, coupled with the inflation factors we've been talking about as well as changes in consumer claiming behavior. A lot of consumers are waiting oftentimes months to get their cars repaired whether that's because they can't get in the queue or they can't get an appointment to get it repaired, but it's just taking longer.  And what that -- what all those factors are showing up as is a much longer tail and property damage on those third-party sub road demand from other carriers. And that is the physical damage strengthening that we reported in the quarter, much of that was in PD, and you see that on the chart that we showed on Page 6 of the presentation. In terms of the dollar amounts getting paid after the end of the calendar year are much more significant than we've seen in the past.  The thing I'd leave you with is because we have this information on kind of longer tail expectations, we're taking that into account as we establish 2022 severity levels. So we're certainly factoring that into the severity increases that we talked about earlier. Yes, Tracy. So as you know, when we increased severity, which we did slightly this quarter relative to where we talked about our severity trends last quarter, that gets applied to claim counts for the entire year. So there is a catch-up component that would have been reflected in the first quarter, had we had perfect information in the first quarter."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mark Nogal.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Kirby. Good morning, and welcome to Allstate's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation, along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate operations. Allstate's results could differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2021 and other public documents for information on potential risks.  Before I hand it off to Tom, I want to share that we will be hosting our second special topic investor call on June 16, focusing on the value of homeowners. We look forward to the additional engagement later this quarter, and we'll share further information soon. And now I'll turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Wilson: Well, good morning, and thank you for investing your time in Allstate today. Now let's start on Slide 2. So Allstate's strategy to deliver Transformative Growth and higher valuation has two components: increase personal profit liability market share and expand protection services, which are shown in the 2 ovals on the left. We're building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution to a Transformative Growth. We're also diversifying our business by expanding protection offerings as shown in the bottom.  In the first quarter, we made progress in 3 key areas to execute this strategy. We're 6 months into a multifaceted plan to address the negative impact of inflation, which is largely in auto insurance. This begins with aggressively raising prices. We're doing this surgically and raising prices more for new or shorter tenured customers with less profitability and less for longer tenured profitable customers. Progress was also made in executing programs to reduce expenses and manage loss costs. We also shifted our asset allocations by reducing the interest rate exposure of our bond portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year, which lowered the overall enterprise impact from higher inflation by $800 million.  Secondly, we continue to make progress on transformative growth by expanding customer access increasing pricing sophistication and building new technology ecosystems. Protection Services also continues its profitable growth trajectory with revenue growth of almost 14% above the prior year.  Moving to Slide 3, let's discuss first quarter performance in more detail. Property liability premiums earned increased 6.1% due to higher average premiums and a 2.1% growth in policies in force. Net investment income of $594 million was 16.1% below the prior year quarter, reflecting lower fixed income reinvestment rates, the impact of reducing the bond portfolio duration and strong performance-based portfolio income that was in comparison to an exceptional prior year quarter.  Net income of $630 million in the first quarter compares to a $1.4 billion loss in the prior year, which included losses related to the disposition of the life and annuity businesses. Adjusted net income of $726 million or $2.58 per diluted share declined compared to the nearly $1.9 billion generated in the prior year quarter due to lower underwriting income. You'll remember, last year's first quarter reflected low auto accident frequency because of the pandemic and inflation and loss costs had not yet been realized. We provided over $1 billion in cash returns to shareholders in the quarter and reduced outstanding shares by 8.1% over the last 12 months.  Moving to Slide 4. You can see how income from homeowners insurance, investments, Protection Services and health and benefits mitigated the negative impact as inflation had on auto insurance. Insurance underwriting margins provided $267 million of after-tax adjusted net income or $0.95 a share. Auto insurance generated a slight underwriting loss with a recorded combined ratio of B. Our industry-leading homeowners insurance business generated underwriting income that contributed $335 million of adjusted net income or $1.19 per share. And although performance-based investment income declined from record highs in 2021, results were still strong in the first quarter, with property liability net investment income contributing $1.56 per share. Protection Services and Health and Benefits income more than offset the losses in auto insurance.  Now let me turn it over to Glenn to discuss the property liability results in more detail.\nGlenn Shapiro: Thanks, Tom. Starting on Page 5, we'll talk about profitability in Allstate Brand auto insurance. We target mid-90s combined ratio in auto insurance. And as you could see from the chart on the left, we have a long history of meeting or exceeding that target, supported by our pricing sophistication, underwriting, claims expertise, expense management. And of course, when you look at 2020 in that chart, it's an outlier in terms of the view because we had much better than target results due to the early pandemic impacts. On the chart on the right breaks down the 5 most recent quarters, highlighting the significant increase in combined ratio that occurred in 2021, as we transitioned from those favorable pandemic impacts to the high inflation environment that we're in today. . In late 2020 and early 2021, as Tom just mentioned, while we were running a combined ratio around 80 and benefiting from frequency and the improved cost structure changes we've made, we took price decreases. And then as inflation spiked in Q2 and Q3 of last year, we shifted towards rate increases, which ramped up significantly in the last 6 months. The recorded and underlying combined ratios improved sequentially in the first quarter of '22, though inflationary trends continue to pressure margins with increasing severity. And frequency is obviously higher year-over-year from that low point, but it's been very stable in terms of maintaining lower level frequency compared to pre-pandemic levels. We'll go deeper into severity and pricing for auto insurance in the next few pages.  So let's move to Slide 6 and talk about Allstate auto physical damage claims severity in more detail. The story of higher severity has continued into 2022, and it's across the country, as you can see from the map on the left. Allstate Brand report year 2022 incurred severity for property damage increased about 11% compared to report year '21. Now recall that we shifted to report year incurred severity to give you a better view directly into what's recorded in our financials. And it's really important to note on this that when you look at paid severities, it's typically shared as a comparison to the prior year quarter or year-to-date or some prior period, whereas our new disclosure is an estimate of the full change in the fully developed report year severities year-over-year. So the 11% in this case, is the expected severity in '22 over all of 2021, inclusive of the inflation seen in quarters 2 through 4.  On the chart on the right, you can see that Allstate has a higher distribution of total loss claims involving newer vehicles compared to the industry. And while those vehicles come with higher premiums, they also can adversely impact total loss severity when vehicle values rise. We're adjusting pricing and using our strong claim capabilities to mitigate rising costs, and that includes leveraging our scale, our operating processes, experienced claim professionals, technology, broad repair relationships that we have and our investments in data and analytics to help contain costs for customers.  Moving to Slide 7. Let's talk about bodily injury severity increases because they've also contributed to auto insurance cost and price increases. Like property damage, casualty loss trends have been elevated for the past few years and continued into '22. But the bodily injury pressure isn't quite as wide spread. Allstate brand report year '22 incurred severity for bodily injury increased about 8% compared to report year '21. Higher-speed accidents and less congested roads are leading to harder impact crashes and more severe injuries, and an evolving legal environment is also a factor in casualty costs. If you look at the chart on the left, you'll see that claims resulting in a nondrivable vehicle, which would mean kind of a harder hit and claims resulting in bodily injury claims with a major injury designation have increased compared to pre-pandemic levels. That's driving a shift to more complex and costly treatments and contributing to higher medical consumption.  In terms of the legal environment, trial attorney advertising for claimants has doubled over the past decade and exceeds $1 billion annually now. That results in higher attorney representation rates, and ultimately, higher costs for consumers. The chart on the right shows the severity variance to prior years trending higher in some of our more populous states like Texas, Florida, Georgia, New York and California. And Texas actually accounted for about 80% of the prior report year strengthening within bodily injury in the first quarter. Here again, our scale, our investments in technology and in data and analytics and our claim expertise are helping us resolve claims fairly, accurately and efficiently.  Moving to Slide 8, let's talk about another key component to our multifaceted plan to deal with inflation, and that's raising auto insurance prices. The table on the left provides a view into 2021 in the first quarter of '22 rate actions in Allstate Brand Auto. We implemented rate decreases as we talked about earlier, in early '21 to reflect our continued lower frequency and expense reductions. In the second quarter, as inflation picked up, we pulled back on any reductions and began increasing rates by the third quarter, and then those rate actions accelerated in the fourth quarter and then further accelerate in the first quarter this year. In the first quarter of '22, we implemented rate in 28 states with an average increase of 9.3% and a weighted Allstate Brand Auto premium impact of 3.6%. When you combine that with the fourth quarter actions, we've increased weighted rates by 6.5% over the last 6 months, and that equates to a gross annualized written premium impact of $1.6 billion within the Allstate brand.  About 95% of our premiums in the U.S. are coming from 6-month term policies. So the rates will improve margins, but there's a lag between when the rates are implemented and they're ultimately earned, which you can see in the chart on the right, which estimates when the rate increases taken in the last 6 months will be earned into premium. That illustration assumes only 85% of the annualized premium will be earned to account for things like retention and the fact that customers modify their policy terms when faced with a price increase, like changing deductibles or limits.  As you can see, looking at Q1 2022, the rate increases we've taken didn't have a whole lot of impact yet, but you can see it coming in the coming quarters, and it really accelerates. We expect to see significant increases in earned premium beginning in the second half, reaching over $1.1 billion by the first quarter of next year based on the implemented rate so far. And keep in mind that additional rates and increases that we take through this year will be additive and compound on those rate increases. And given the ongoing inflationary pressure, we have increased the magnitude of rate increases we expect to take in the rest of 2022.  We remain very confident in our ability to restore auto profitability to targeted levels, and we'll keep you posted on that in our new monthly disclosures of rate filings.  So let's move to Slide 9 and take a look at something that I think is an undervalued strength at Allstate. It's our industry-leading homeowners business. As you know, a significant portion of our customers bundle home and auto, and that improves the retention and overall economics of both lines of business. We've differentiated our homeowners product and our homeowners capability really, and that goes to our product, our underwriting, our reinsurance, our claims ecosystem. It is a unique entire business model and system in the industry. The graph on the left shows the history of Allstate brand combined ratio in homeowners versus the industry and competitors. And we believe that in order to achieve an adequate return on the capital that's required in this particular line of business, you have to achieve a recorded combined ratio over time at a target of 90% or better. And as you can see from the Allstate dots on that chart, we have a long history of doing exactly that. You can also see that some of our large competitors and the industry as a whole consistently generate combined ratios that don't meet what we find as a definition of needed for a return on capital.  We've repositioned the homeowners business over a multiyear period by reducing exposure to unprofitable geographies, designing new products, creating highly sophisticated pricing plans, improving home inspection and risk selection process and sourcing capital through multiyear reinsurance programs. As a result of all of that, we've consistently generated excellent underwriting results. Since 2017, we've earned $3.3 billion or about $667 million annually in underwriting income with the industry generating an underwriting loss over that same period. Homeowners Insurance and Allstate's Homeowners Insurance is certainly not immune to the rising inflationary environment right now, though. And we see that in the form of higher labor costs and higher material costs. But our products have the sophisticated pricing features needed to respond to those changes and replacement values and help offset the impact.  The chart on the right shows key Allstate Brand Homeowners Insurance operating statistics. And there, you'll see that our net written premium has grown sharply through 2021 and into 2022, increasing 17% from the prior year. We grew policies in force by 1.7% in the first quarter. And our Allstate agents continue to be in a really good spot to broaden customer relationships with homeowners. And our average premiums rose 14.3%, mostly driven by increasing property values, as I mentioned earlier.  The first quarter combined ratio of 83.3% generated $368 million of underwriting income for the Allstate brand. In short, our property insurance business is a competitive advantage, and we aim to continue to leverage that advantage and grow it. And we look forward to sharing additional insights on homeowners with you during our upcoming special topic call on June 16.  And with that, I will turn it over to Mario.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Glenn. Let's move to Slide 10, where we'll discuss how we're improving customer value through cost reductions. The chart on the slide shows the adjusted expense ratio, which is a metric we introduced a couple of quarters ago. This starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-Liability business.  Through innovation and strong execution, we've achieved more than 3 points of improvement since 2018. Over time, we expect to drive an additional 2 points of improvement from rent levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024. This represents approximately a 6-point reduction compared to 2018, enabling an improved competitive position relative to our competitors while maintaining attractive returns. While the adjusted expense ratio increased compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher employee-related costs, we remain committed to our 3-year reduction goals.  Not included in this measure, but in the reported expense ratio was an increase in advertising expenses versus the prior year quarter as we took advantage of a drop in advertising costs and a seasonal increase in direct shopping to ship spending earlier in the year. Advertising will fluctuate throughout the year as we implement auto price increases and could impact near-term growth. Our future cost reduction efforts are focused on digitization, sourcing and operating efficiency and distribution-related costs.  Slide 11, diagrams Transformative Growth with increase market share. This multiyear initiative is designed to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by delivering on 5 key objectives: improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, deploying new technology ecosystems and enhancing organizational capabilities. We made significant progress across each objective in 2021 and are continuing the momentum in 2022.  While the current auto operating environment required rapid price increases, we are confident this plan will generate long-term growth. Starting at the top of the flywheel, we have reduced expenses to improve customer value with more competitive prices while earning target returns. We are building simple, affordable and connected protection solutions that are competitively differentiated. We have enhanced and expanded distribution, including modifying the Allstate agent model to increase growth and decrease distribution costs. We also improved the strength of our direct channel capabilities by leveraging the Allstate brand and significantly expanded in the independent agent channel through National General.  Differentiated products and expanded distribution are supported by increased marketing sophistication and investment. New technology ecosystems lower cost, support protection offerings and improved service and speed to market. This comprehensive approach is like a flywheel that creates sustainable competitive advantage, leading to market share growth. At the bottom of the page, you can see the 5 cases of Transformative Growth. We continue to make meaningful progress as we execute on building the new model in Phase III and begin to scale the new model in Phase 4.  Moving to Slide 12. You can see how expanding customer access better meets customer demand. Starting on the bar on the lower left, you can see the auto insurance industry written premium distribution by channel in 2020 was roughly 1/3 exclusive agency, 1/3 direct and 1/3 independent agency. Allstate's pre Transformative Growth distribution auto new business as of year-end 2019 is shown in the middle bar in Allstate's first quarter 2022 distribution is shown on the right. As you can see, today, the distribution of new business more closely mirrors the industry due to Transformative Growth and the acquisition of National General. The National General acquisition significantly increased our presence in the independent agent channel and offers future growth potential by expanding middle-market product offerings. Direct sales capabilities were improved and expanded from the Esurance base, including the use of the Allstate Brand with lower pricing in this channel.  Allstate agents are and will continue to be the competitive strength as an incentive shift to growth and costs are reduced. Today, the source of new business matches customer preferences and drove a 14% increase in new business applications in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter.  Slide 13 shows the profitable growth of Protection Services. Revenues, which exclude the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives increased 13.6% to $627 million in the quarter. The increase in revenues was driven by continued growth at Allstate Protection Plans, generating a 19.6% increase in revenues to $329 million compared to the prior year quarter. Policies in force also increased 4.7%, reflecting growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Identity Protection. Protection Services policies in force of $147 million are approximately 4x that of property liability, showing how ubiquitous the Allstate brand is becoming. Adjusted net income of $53 million for the first quarter of 2022 increased $4 million compared to the prior year quarter after generating $179 million of adjusted net income for all of 2021.  Moving to Slide 14. Allstate Health and Benefits standing product offering generated growth and income. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual health products to our portfolio, as you can see on the left. Revenues of $581 million in the first quarter of 2022 increased 4.9% to the prior year quarter, driven by higher premiums and contract charges and other revenue, primarily in Group Hub. Adjusted net income of $53 million decreased $12 million from the prior year quarter, driven by increased individual and group health lifes.  Now let's shift to Slide 15, which highlights our investment performance in the reduction of fixed income duration to reduce enterprise exposure to inflation. Net investment income totaled $594 million in the quarter, which is $114 million below the prior year quarter as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income, shown in dark blue, was $72 million below the prior year quarter, but 2021 was an exceptional year for private equity markets and reported income. While results are lower compared to a strong prior year, the performance-based annualized yield of 14% in the first quarter is above long-term average performance. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $31 million below the prior year quarter. As we've discussed, our market-based portfolio yield has declined in the lower interest rate environment over the last few years, with reinvestment rates below our average fixed income portfolio yield. The fixed income yield was further reduced by actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2021 to lower portfolio duration and reduce the negative impact higher inflation and interest rates would have on our fixed income portfolio valuations.  The chart on the right illustrates our proactive management of interest rate exposure over the interest rate cycle. After shortening duration late in the fourth quarter of 2021, we further reduced duration by 0.7 years in the first quarter. The increase in interest rates in the quarter decreased our fixed income valuations by $2 billion, resulting in a negative portfolio return of 2.8%. However, our interest rate risk mitigation lowered the negative impact of higher interest rates by approximately $800 million versus our position at the end of the third quarter of last year. The shorter duration portfolio also positions us to reinvest in higher market yields as interest rates continue to rise.  Now let's move to Slide 16, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position. Adjusted net income return on equity of 12.8% was below the prior year period due to lower auto insurance underwriting income. Allstate's strong capital position continues to enable significant cash returns to shareholders. We returned $1 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2022. Common shares outstanding were reduced by 8.1% over the last 12 months, 16.9% since 2018 and 45% since 2011, reflecting our history of providing strong cash returns to shareholders.  As of March 31, 2022, we had $2.5 million remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by early 2023.  With that context, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Bank of America.\nJoshua Shanker: I guess, the Agency segment, you guys added 159,000 auto policies in the quarter net and lost 5,000 homeowners policies. I don't know if those are our encompass policies or if those are net gen policies. But it does seem like you're adding a lot of monoline auto, which is a lower persistency than the overall Allstate book. Given where your pricing is in the net gen book, how comfortable are you with the monoline drivers you're adding right now? And what is the strategy there on April of 2022 versus where it will be in 1.5 years?\nThomas Wilson: Josh, let me go up and then I'll let Glenn take the specific part. So we bought National General in part to get into the monoline stuff you're talking about. So we wanted -- we needed a stronger presence in the nonstandard business, particularly designed with the products and the pricing on it. We also thought we had -- and see great potential with the independent agent business. And so our goal is to take that strength in nonstandard, add our standard auto insurance and our homeowners product to that portfolio and really leverage the distribution. So you should -- we expect to see not only just growth from picking up new product line but also by expanding our existing product line through that distribution. . The homeowners piece is basically we got to make them us. We're really good at homeowners. I think they were okay at homeowners. And so you see some of the reduction being us getting their profit targets to where they need to be. Glenn, why don't you take the specifics of how that works?\nGlenn Shapiro: Great. And thanks for the question, Josh. So it is definitely 2 different stories on the auto and home, as Tom mentioned. So auto, the first quarter is the shopping quarter in nonstandard auto. It's by far the biggest shopping quarter and our National General team did a really nice job of being in the market in the right places in the places they felt they had good profitability and the right pricing and growing effectively. So think of that one as -- and you're right, it's shorter duration business in terms of lifetime value, but that is their business model and they make a good return on those policies. So they grew auto in that way. . As Tom just mentioned, on the homeowner side, this has been a shift to the homeowner strategy in NatGen time that we're in we're really taking the Allstate strength and making it a strength of NatGen. So they've had to get some pricing in there. They haven't -- they've shrunk a bit in homeowners, but that's setting ourselves up for than the strategy part of this, which is as we get our middle-market products based on that Allstate data and the Allstate capabilities into the independent agent channel marketed as National General and Allstate company, the endorsed branding, that we think we have a really great opportunity to grow homeowners with the Allstate level of sophistication and pricing and all the things I talked about in the opening remarks. But in a channel, we really haven't meaningfully been in before. So that's the path forward. But as we sit from a 1-quarter basis, we're still in, I guess, correction mode of the homeowners business there, but in a really good quarter and in a really good place from a nonstandard auto standpoint.\nJoshua Shanker: Okay. And [indiscernible] reputation is the only person who asked a question is about Allstate Protection Plans. I want to go to another area that never gets any questions. Allstate Commercial, as I calculated, it seems like you guys are running at about 120% combined ratio in that business, but growing very quickly. What is it and what exactly is going on there? And maybe I'm wrong.\nThomas Wilson: No. We always appreciate your precision, Josh. First, I am not pleased -- none of us are pleased with the results of Allstate Business Insurance. So we review -- we've done a bunch of work to improve the profitability in that line. There's really 2 parts to the business. And one is the, what I would just call traditional commercial insurers, small contract or stuff like that, that we sell through Allstate agents. And then there's the shared economy business. And it's a shared economy business that has been trouble for us from a profitability standpoint, particularly a home-sharing company and then some states in the transportation network companies. . And we made a decision last year that we weren't going to chase revenue if we didn't think that the states were profitable. So we exited a number of states. I think 3 big states, in particular, in the transportation network piece because they were not profitable. And then the home-sharing business, we just got out of that contract altogether.  Glenn, do you want to -- what would you like to add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: I would just add that if you look at -- when you're talking about the premium growth there, it is 2 things in large part. One is, we've raised rates in sort of the traditional small commercial business we have. So rates are materially up, units are not. The other is that a year ago, transportation business is -- because we have -- the charge by mile and we pay them for the usage. A year ago, there was very little usage still in those transportation networks, and there's a lot more usage and therefore, a lot more premium right now. And we have raised, as Tom said, we've gotten out of some states and we've raised rates on those. So we think the profitability go forward is better. So it's not growth in that we're piling on business as we've gotten a lot more revenue coming through.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: I appreciate the new information and your updated investor slide deck, just FYI. So I'm going to focus my one question on Slide 8. And I'm just trying to put the pieces together of the information you provided us around pricing. Tom, you mentioned in your opening remarks, surgical pricing, and you talked about how you're differentiating between lower lifetime value customers and longer lifetime values. Glenn, you talked about a lot of rate in the pipeline that's going to affect earned premium going forward.  And I was trying to reconcile the language difference from your February cat and pricing report to your March cat and pricing report. And the difference between the 2, just 1 month later in the March pricing report, you said that that effectively lost cost inflations were exceeding your targets and you were going to have to raise prices even more, just 1 month later from your February pricing report. So I was hoping maybe you could put all those pieces together for us and sort of map out what's going on.\nGlenn Shapiro: Tom, did you want to start on that? Or do you want me to?\nThomas Wilson: Yes, sorry, I was on mute. It was quite articulate but -- great. Let me start off and then I'll get Glenn and Mario to give you more specifics. So first, obviously, increasing price is really important to getting our auto insurance possibility. We've been aggressive, but we believe smart about spreading it between newer less profitable customers and profitable longer-tenure customers. And so obviously, let's say you have a customer who's been with you 10 years and you're making a 95% combined ratio, and you have one that's new and you're losing money on it.  And you have to raise your rates to cover the higher inflation, which impacts both customers. If you give them both the same amount, you run the risk of losing that long-tenured profitable customer. So we've put less rate into our, what we would call, older closed books and more into our newer books with shorter-term customers. And we believe that, that protects lifetime value and will help with retention. In this new space, retention is going to be a challenge for all companies. And so we're -- but we're trying to make sure we manage our way through it. So the numbers that you see on Slide 8 are the total between all the customers, whether new old profitable, unprofitable to help us get there. But it's more surgical than it appears. I would say the other part is what we're doing auto profitability back to Glenn's earlier slide was like we know how to make money in auto insurance, and we're going to make money in auto insurance. But we want to make sure it's sustainable.  One is the way we're taking those prices. Two is make sure the expense reductions are permanent, not just temporary, making sure you manage your loss costs differently, and just make sure you're being -- continuing to invest in sophistication and new products. So we feel good about this, but then hopefully, that provides some insight. As to the change in the outlook, that maybe be more what we said than just sort of like waking up in the month of March and deciding we're going to say something different. Glenn, do you want to talk about how this has unfolded. And Mario, if you're going to go onto closures, that would be helpful.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So I'll start with how it unfolded. I mean -- I would say, we continue to see inflation run like a lot of people continue to see. We continue to see elongated time frames for development, including prior year development. And so we're taking, I think, an appropriately conservative view and saying that like we're going to need more rate on that part of it. The other part on the precision, I want to build on what Tom said, because it's an important point because we do use a lot of precision.  And I think that there some folks who talk more -- or some companies talk more or less about their level of segmentation and precision. We maybe don't do a good enough job talking about the depth that we have in terms of our segmentation, which is highly sophisticated and that's what Tom is going into. But it's sophistication at that level, but also on the go-to-market level. Because clearly, we kept marketing open, and we took an opportunity to grow some business that the economics were good on. We did that because the marketing cost itself was down with others leaving that area. There were a lot of shoppers and first quarter tends to be a time that a lot of people shop. . Now we also did that with a lot of precision. It's the entire go-to-market system because we're not just -- to sort of have the open sign everywhere. It is -- we're marketing precisely where we know we have a lifetime value return based on risk type based on market within state level. And it's a combination of underwriting, marketing, pricing that all comes together -- and distribution that all comes together with how we go to market and drive where we want to grow and how we want to grow that I think goes into the need for rate as well.\nMario Rizzo: Yes. If I can just add, Greg, this is Mario. First, I guess, where I'd start is, the objective of providing that rate information monthly that we started this year was really to create a level of transparency into what we were doing with auto profitability with rates being such a significant lever and provide you all with a view of the progress we're making but also some color around what we're seeing on a forward-looking basis. So that's the objective. And the language we used in the most recent disclosure provided, I think, some additional context.  In terms of what's happening, I think we continue to look at loss trends month-in and month-out, both in terms of reserve levels, severe trends and just loss trends overall. And the statement we made in our most recent release was really a reflection of what we were seeing in loss trends in severity development both in terms of what we saw in last year, we strengthened reserves by $151 million in auto this quarter and what we were seeing in terms of the physical damage severity escalation as well as what -- how that translated into current year severity. So we're taking that data. We're looking at it. We're working with the pricing team and factoring it into our outlook and the purpose of the disclosure again is to tell you what we did, but also provide a little more texture around what we're seeing in the market. .\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman of Credit Suisse.\nAndrew Kligerman: Yes, great answer to the prior question. I guess you didn't mention anything about non-rate actions. Would it be possible to discuss nonrate actions as as maybe a percent of the business that you're able to get that on and maybe how much that might be contributing to improved performance?\nThomas Wilson: Glenn, do you want to take that for both the Allstate Brand and National General?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So one, and if you saw the -- I'll go to the National General first, we saw that National General underlying combined ratio looked pretty good in the first quarter. And one of the things that they have that's really stable is fee structure. The fee structure is a nonrate element that turns out to be really stable over time and helps them predict and plan for their combined ratio. When I think about nonrate actions across the Allstate book, it really goes back to what I was talking about where it's about -- I don't like to isolate it to the word underwriting because then it sounds like you're sort of deciding to write or not to write as opposed to getting the right level of rate for each type of risk, but that also goes into with underwriting and marketing and distribution how you go to market.  And where we've really built our sophistication is in how our marketing team, our underwriting and product teams and pricing and our distribution organization deploy resources quickly and nimbly to where and how we're looking to grow. And I think that in itself generates a lot of the long-term economic value that we drive.\nAndrew Kligerman: Okay. So really not any real actions to -- okay, makes a lot of sense. And then if I could just quickly sneak one in. The buyback of $794 million that's pretty fast in terms of the pace. I thought you had about $3.3 billion left, and this implies you're going at a quicker pace. Is there a chance that you could complete that authorization by the end of this year or do more than you anticipated because it seems pretty robust and I was curious about the thinking there.\nThomas Wilson: Andrew, it's Tom. First, on the actions. You will see though -- I know you will see some things like down-pay requirements and stuff like that, that we will change going forward to help manage the selection of the business. So Glenn is absolutely right that we're being very precise in which stuff we want, but if we feel like there are certain policy terms and things we can change or payment terms that we can change that will help us, we will put those in place. . On the buyback Mario is committed to have it done early in the first quarter of next year. Mario, anything you want to add to that?\nMario Rizzo: No, I think that's right, Tom. So I wouldn't read too much into any one quarter. We still have $2.5 billion left to buy. We said we'll complete it by early next year, and that's the point.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. .\nDavid Motemaden: I had a question on Slide 8. It says that you guys have a higher mix of newer, more expensive vehicles. Glenn, I believe you said that those vehicles come with higher premiums, and they can adversely impact total loss severity when vehicle values rise. Does the fact that you have more of a mix of more expensive vehicles, does that increase -- or does that mean that you need to take more rate relative to peers? Or I guess, how should I interpret this mix difference that you guys have versus peers?\nThomas Wilson: Glenn, do you want to do that?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So there's a few parts to that because I'll talk more macro about the auto -- the car park out there and like the whole system. With every new model year newer that we get and every year that passes, we've done the math through what's in our book of business, what type of safety elements are in cars, accident avoidance, technology and everything. And we know 2 things: one, that we get a little bit of a tailwind with every year that passes on frequency, and we get a little bit of a headwind on severity because they're more expensive to fix, more sensors and so on. And the reason I started there is that would be true of this example as well. The fact that our book of business tends to trend that way more, it will give us a little bit of a sustainable benefit on frequency in comparison to others, and it will give us a little bit of a sustainable headwind on the severity.  But we do charge premium based on make and model year and you get a higher premium for it. It was more of a statement in that opening that as we look at and we try to put our trends, whether we're looking at Fast Track or looking at public disclosures, when we look at our trends on bodily injury or property damage, which are third-party vehicles, and then collision first-party vehicles, we see some of that difference come through and then have to like do the math back to our premium and ensure that we're getting the right rates for all of that.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Fantastic. I wanted to dig in a little more to your comments on homeowners and the automatic lift because we've seen a little bit of deterioration in the underlying loss ratio all of last year into the first quarter. Is the automatic, I guess, inflation guard changing? Are there other steps that are necessary in homeowners?\nThomas Wilson: Well, the first, we're really happy with where the homeowners business is today in terms of its profitability. As you know, sometimes it bounces around because catastrophes -- we had slightly lower catastrophes this quarter than the prior year quarter, but still earn a really good return. The underlying combined ratio, as you point out, which excludes catastrophes, ticked up a little bit. We feel comfortable with where that is in part because of the inflation parts that you mentioned that come through, what we call PIA, Property Insurance Adjustment. It really raises average premium. And as that burns in to earn premium just like it does burn through in auto that cover some of those increased costs. If it doesn't, we have plenty of room to go in and continue to prices. Glenn, what would you add about severity in the combined ratio in [indiscernible]?\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes. So first, I always start with I think we're accountable for the recorded combined ratio because ultimately, if we always had a good underlying but like we hadn't gotten the right reinsurance or we hadn't been in the right locations, and we hadn't done good risk mapping for wildfire or hail or hurricane or any other exposure and we were constantly running what the industry or key competitors run. I think you would rightfully hold us accountable for that. So I always go back to the recorded combined ratio. That said, the underlying, as Tom said, it moves up and down a little bit, and we do watch that primarily though we watch the recorded combined ratio.  Right now, like Tom, I feel really good about where we are. Severity ran hot in the first quarter. It's tough to look at one quarter in homeowners and draw a lot of conclusions because there's a decent amount of volatility between the mix of perils in homeowners. It's not nearly as stable as auto in that way. And so we're watching that, that was a high number, but we got an average price increase, average earned premium of 14.3% burning through, which really ticked up in the latter part of the year last year. So we'll continue to give us benefit as that earns through. And we're in -- obviously, we're really good shape in homeowners, and I feel good about it.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's helpful. Second question on the auto side. I just want to make sure that I'm understanding the commentary on the surgical application of rate increases, should we expect, I guess, suppressed new business as the strategy works its way through to the extent that rate increases are being focused on lower tenured customers? .\nThomas Wilson: I'll start off and then Glenn, you can jump in. I think a lot of this premier depends on what happens in the competitive environment. So as other people are taking rents, it depends where they're spreading their rates. So if you buy on the renewal book, then that will create more shoppers because those tend to be people who shop less than just putting it all on the new business. But part of it depends what happens, how people do it. That said we feel pretty good about where we track our competitive position, the LTI index with our LTI Index at this point. So we're hopeful that as we move through this, we'll still continue to grow. With Transformative Growth on top of that, we think that it all still hangs together in terms of increasing market share.  Glenn, what would you add to that?\nGlenn Shapiro: I'll just add if you take the long term and the short term, the long term first, as Tom said, our expanded customer access, our work on improving value as we get the 3 points at cost that Mario talked about out and we've got access into all these systems, and we get middle market products into the IA channel and our exclusive agents are humming, we've got a really good long-term prognosis on that. . With your question, you were asking, I think, some about the short term. So as you think about what we did early this year, we pulled marketing dollars forward, and we've talked about the fact that we pulled them forward. That's not the same as increasing them. It did increase in the quarter, but it's pulling it forward. That means it does have to come out of somewhere, too. We decided to do that because there were good economics on the marketing. A number of companies publicly talked about pulling back from marketing that left from the supply and demand curve of marketing costs that left it reasonable, and there was good economics on it, plus a lot of business gets sold in the first quarter.  So we thought with a lot of shoppers in the market with rates out there, that it would be a good time to be in the market where we had our prices in, and we felt good about the lifetime value. That said, inflation is continuing to run and we're taking more rate, and we pulled that money forward from later. So marketing will reduce from this point and that could have a short-term impact on new business growth, plus we've got -- everybody will have headwinds on retention with the amount of rate that's in the system across the industry.\nThomas Wilson: Yes. I think when you go back to Glenn's long term. Bottom we like prospects for sustainable profitable growth. I mean, auto insurance, we know how to buy money and with transformative growth, we really grow that business. You add homeowners on top of that, which is really a growth business. And just like price and value are important to auto insurance customers, it's also important in investing. And when you look at the price of Allstate, it's essentially less than your other options. That's why we think transformative growth is going to increase nation multiples. .\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS.\nBrian Meredith: A quick question here. On Slide 11 of your supplement, you've got an interesting chart here that looks at auto state profitability. Just my question is, is this based on an earned kind of basis? Or is on a written basis. And if it's on an earned basis, how would this chart look on a written basis, as far as what states do you think are currently pretty close to rate adequate?\nThomas Wilson: Well, that's a tough question. I don't know if we -- Glenn, do you want to take the forward looking.\nGlenn Shapiro: Yes, I'll take it. Yes. So it's definitely earned basis in that we look at our when you look at combined ratios, it's on an earned basis. So you're hitting a really important point. So it's an astute observation. Because I think about that disclosure and you could look at -- when you look at the percentage of states that are above 100, for example, that is not the same as looking at the way we look at where do we want to grow. Because the state could be above 100 right now, but we've just gotten in the rate we feel we need to be adequate. So any new business we put on is going to be at a rate adequate level that we like, and we would want to grow there. So it really does lag and you have to go back to Page 8 and see where that -- which we don't -- because that's an estimate. We don't estimate every state and disclose based on when we'll earn the premiums and what percentage will earn by state and what that will do. But the point is, while that's a snapshot of where we are today, that does not reflect all of the written premiums and increases that we've got. .\nThomas Wilson: Okay. Well, thank you all for engaging with us today. As we go forward, we look forward to in the next month or so talking about homeowners -- and then we continue to execute in the meantime our multi-facet fan, both to improve profitability of auto insurance and to get Transformative Growth because that's a key component to sustainable growth, and both of those will improve shareholder value. So thank you for your engagement, and we'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: Thank you so much to our presenters and to everyone who participated. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Wilson",
            "content": "Well, good morning, and thank you for investing your time in Allstate today. Now let's start on Slide 2. So Allstate's strategy to deliver Transformative Growth and higher valuation has two components: increase personal profit liability market share and expand protection services, which are shown in the 2 ovals on the left. We're building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution to a Transformative Growth. We're also diversifying our business by expanding protection offerings as shown in the bottom.  In the first quarter, we made progress in 3 key areas to execute this strategy. We're 6 months into a multifaceted plan to address the negative impact of inflation, which is largely in auto insurance. This begins with aggressively raising prices. We're doing this surgically and raising prices more for new or shorter tenured customers with less profitability and less for longer tenured profitable customers. Progress was also made in executing programs to reduce expenses and manage loss costs. We also shifted our asset allocations by reducing the interest rate exposure of our bond portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year, which lowered the overall enterprise impact from higher inflation by $800 million.  Secondly, we continue to make progress on transformative growth by expanding customer access increasing pricing sophistication and building new technology ecosystems. Protection Services also continues its profitable growth trajectory with revenue growth of almost 14% above the prior year.  Moving to Slide 3, let's discuss first quarter performance in more detail. Property liability premiums earned increased 6.1% due to higher average premiums and a 2.1% growth in policies in force. Net investment income of $594 million was 16.1% below the prior year quarter, reflecting lower fixed income reinvestment rates, the impact of reducing the bond portfolio duration and strong performance-based portfolio income that was in comparison to an exceptional prior year quarter.  Net income of $630 million in the first quarter compares to a $1.4 billion loss in the prior year, which included losses related to the disposition of the life and annuity businesses. Adjusted net income of $726 million or $2.58 per diluted share declined compared to the nearly $1.9 billion generated in the prior year quarter due to lower underwriting income. You'll remember, last year's first quarter reflected low auto accident frequency because of the pandemic and inflation and loss costs had not yet been realized. We provided over $1 billion in cash returns to shareholders in the quarter and reduced outstanding shares by 8.1% over the last 12 months.  Moving to Slide 4. You can see how income from homeowners insurance, investments, Protection Services and health and benefits mitigated the negative impact as inflation had on auto insurance. Insurance underwriting margins provided $267 million of after-tax adjusted net income or $0.95 a share. Auto insurance generated a slight underwriting loss with a recorded combined ratio of B. Our industry-leading homeowners insurance business generated underwriting income that contributed $335 million of adjusted net income or $1.19 per share. And although performance-based investment income declined from record highs in 2021, results were still strong in the first quarter, with property liability net investment income contributing $1.56 per share. Protection Services and Health and Benefits income more than offset the losses in auto insurance.  Now let me turn it over to Glenn to discuss the property liability results in more detail. Josh, let me go up and then I'll let Glenn take the specific part. So we bought National General in part to get into the monoline stuff you're talking about. So we wanted -- we needed a stronger presence in the nonstandard business, particularly designed with the products and the pricing on it. We also thought we had -- and see great potential with the independent agent business. And so our goal is to take that strength in nonstandard, add our standard auto insurance and our homeowners product to that portfolio and really leverage the distribution. So you should -- we expect to see not only just growth from picking up new product line but also by expanding our existing product line through that distribution. . The homeowners piece is basically we got to make them us. We're really good at homeowners. I think they were okay at homeowners. And so you see some of the reduction being us getting their profit targets to where they need to be. Glenn, why don't you take the specifics of how that works? No. We always appreciate your precision, Josh. First, I am not pleased -- none of us are pleased with the results of Allstate Business Insurance. So we review -- we've done a bunch of work to improve the profitability in that line. There's really 2 parts to the business. And one is the, what I would just call traditional commercial insurers, small contract or stuff like that, that we sell through Allstate agents. And then there's the shared economy business. And it's a shared economy business that has been trouble for us from a profitability standpoint, particularly a home-sharing company and then some states in the transportation network companies. . And we made a decision last year that we weren't going to chase revenue if we didn't think that the states were profitable. So we exited a number of states. I think 3 big states, in particular, in the transportation network piece because they were not profitable. And then the home-sharing business, we just got out of that contract altogether.  Glenn, do you want to -- what would you like to add to that? Yes, sorry, I was on mute. It was quite articulate but -- great. Let me start off and then I'll get Glenn and Mario to give you more specifics. So first, obviously, increasing price is really important to getting our auto insurance possibility. We've been aggressive, but we believe smart about spreading it between newer less profitable customers and profitable longer-tenure customers. And so obviously, let's say you have a customer who's been with you 10 years and you're making a 95% combined ratio, and you have one that's new and you're losing money on it.  And you have to raise your rates to cover the higher inflation, which impacts both customers. If you give them both the same amount, you run the risk of losing that long-tenured profitable customer. So we've put less rate into our, what we would call, older closed books and more into our newer books with shorter-term customers. And we believe that, that protects lifetime value and will help with retention. In this new space, retention is going to be a challenge for all companies. And so we're -- but we're trying to make sure we manage our way through it. So the numbers that you see on Slide 8 are the total between all the customers, whether new old profitable, unprofitable to help us get there. But it's more surgical than it appears. I would say the other part is what we're doing auto profitability back to Glenn's earlier slide was like we know how to make money in auto insurance, and we're going to make money in auto insurance. But we want to make sure it's sustainable.  One is the way we're taking those prices. Two is make sure the expense reductions are permanent, not just temporary, making sure you manage your loss costs differently, and just make sure you're being -- continuing to invest in sophistication and new products. So we feel good about this, but then hopefully, that provides some insight. As to the change in the outlook, that maybe be more what we said than just sort of like waking up in the month of March and deciding we're going to say something different. Glenn, do you want to talk about how this has unfolded. And Mario, if you're going to go onto closures, that would be helpful. Glenn, do you want to take that for both the Allstate Brand and National General? Andrew, it's Tom. First, on the actions. You will see though -- I know you will see some things like down-pay requirements and stuff like that, that we will change going forward to help manage the selection of the business. So Glenn is absolutely right that we're being very precise in which stuff we want, but if we feel like there are certain policy terms and things we can change or payment terms that we can change that will help us, we will put those in place. . On the buyback Mario is committed to have it done early in the first quarter of next year. Mario, anything you want to add to that? Glenn, do you want to do that? Well, the first, we're really happy with where the homeowners business is today in terms of its profitability. As you know, sometimes it bounces around because catastrophes -- we had slightly lower catastrophes this quarter than the prior year quarter, but still earn a really good return. The underlying combined ratio, as you point out, which excludes catastrophes, ticked up a little bit. We feel comfortable with where that is in part because of the inflation parts that you mentioned that come through, what we call PIA, Property Insurance Adjustment. It really raises average premium. And as that burns in to earn premium just like it does burn through in auto that cover some of those increased costs. If it doesn't, we have plenty of room to go in and continue to prices. Glenn, what would you add about severity in the combined ratio in [indiscernible]? I'll start off and then Glenn, you can jump in. I think a lot of this premier depends on what happens in the competitive environment. So as other people are taking rents, it depends where they're spreading their rates. So if you buy on the renewal book, then that will create more shoppers because those tend to be people who shop less than just putting it all on the new business. But part of it depends what happens, how people do it. That said we feel pretty good about where we track our competitive position, the LTI index with our LTI Index at this point. So we're hopeful that as we move through this, we'll still continue to grow. With Transformative Growth on top of that, we think that it all still hangs together in terms of increasing market share.  Glenn, what would you add to that? Yes. I think when you go back to Glenn's long term. Bottom we like prospects for sustainable profitable growth. I mean, auto insurance, we know how to buy money and with transformative growth, we really grow that business. You add homeowners on top of that, which is really a growth business. And just like price and value are important to auto insurance customers, it's also important in investing. And when you look at the price of Allstate, it's essentially less than your other options. That's why we think transformative growth is going to increase nation multiples. . Well, that's a tough question. I don't know if we -- Glenn, do you want to take the forward looking. Okay. Well, thank you all for engaging with us today. As we go forward, we look forward to in the next month or so talking about homeowners -- and then we continue to execute in the meantime our multi-facet fan, both to improve profitability of auto insurance and to get Transformative Growth because that's a key component to sustainable growth, and both of those will improve shareholder value. So thank you for your engagement, and we'll talk to you soon."

            "name": "Glenn Shapiro",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Starting on Page 5, we'll talk about profitability in Allstate Brand auto insurance. We target mid-90s combined ratio in auto insurance. And as you could see from the chart on the left, we have a long history of meeting or exceeding that target, supported by our pricing sophistication, underwriting, claims expertise, expense management. And of course, when you look at 2020 in that chart, it's an outlier in terms of the view because we had much better than target results due to the early pandemic impacts. On the chart on the right breaks down the 5 most recent quarters, highlighting the significant increase in combined ratio that occurred in 2021, as we transitioned from those favorable pandemic impacts to the high inflation environment that we're in today. . In late 2020 and early 2021, as Tom just mentioned, while we were running a combined ratio around 80 and benefiting from frequency and the improved cost structure changes we've made, we took price decreases. And then as inflation spiked in Q2 and Q3 of last year, we shifted towards rate increases, which ramped up significantly in the last 6 months. The recorded and underlying combined ratios improved sequentially in the first quarter of '22, though inflationary trends continue to pressure margins with increasing severity. And frequency is obviously higher year-over-year from that low point, but it's been very stable in terms of maintaining lower level frequency compared to pre-pandemic levels. We'll go deeper into severity and pricing for auto insurance in the next few pages.  So let's move to Slide 6 and talk about Allstate auto physical damage claims severity in more detail. The story of higher severity has continued into 2022, and it's across the country, as you can see from the map on the left. Allstate Brand report year 2022 incurred severity for property damage increased about 11% compared to report year '21. Now recall that we shifted to report year incurred severity to give you a better view directly into what's recorded in our financials. And it's really important to note on this that when you look at paid severities, it's typically shared as a comparison to the prior year quarter or year-to-date or some prior period, whereas our new disclosure is an estimate of the full change in the fully developed report year severities year-over-year. So the 11% in this case, is the expected severity in '22 over all of 2021, inclusive of the inflation seen in quarters 2 through 4.  On the chart on the right, you can see that Allstate has a higher distribution of total loss claims involving newer vehicles compared to the industry. And while those vehicles come with higher premiums, they also can adversely impact total loss severity when vehicle values rise. We're adjusting pricing and using our strong claim capabilities to mitigate rising costs, and that includes leveraging our scale, our operating processes, experienced claim professionals, technology, broad repair relationships that we have and our investments in data and analytics to help contain costs for customers.  Moving to Slide 7. Let's talk about bodily injury severity increases because they've also contributed to auto insurance cost and price increases. Like property damage, casualty loss trends have been elevated for the past few years and continued into '22. But the bodily injury pressure isn't quite as wide spread. Allstate brand report year '22 incurred severity for bodily injury increased about 8% compared to report year '21. Higher-speed accidents and less congested roads are leading to harder impact crashes and more severe injuries, and an evolving legal environment is also a factor in casualty costs. If you look at the chart on the left, you'll see that claims resulting in a nondrivable vehicle, which would mean kind of a harder hit and claims resulting in bodily injury claims with a major injury designation have increased compared to pre-pandemic levels. That's driving a shift to more complex and costly treatments and contributing to higher medical consumption.  In terms of the legal environment, trial attorney advertising for claimants has doubled over the past decade and exceeds $1 billion annually now. That results in higher attorney representation rates, and ultimately, higher costs for consumers. The chart on the right shows the severity variance to prior years trending higher in some of our more populous states like Texas, Florida, Georgia, New York and California. And Texas actually accounted for about 80% of the prior report year strengthening within bodily injury in the first quarter. Here again, our scale, our investments in technology and in data and analytics and our claim expertise are helping us resolve claims fairly, accurately and efficiently.  Moving to Slide 8, let's talk about another key component to our multifaceted plan to deal with inflation, and that's raising auto insurance prices. The table on the left provides a view into 2021 in the first quarter of '22 rate actions in Allstate Brand Auto. We implemented rate decreases as we talked about earlier, in early '21 to reflect our continued lower frequency and expense reductions. In the second quarter, as inflation picked up, we pulled back on any reductions and began increasing rates by the third quarter, and then those rate actions accelerated in the fourth quarter and then further accelerate in the first quarter this year. In the first quarter of '22, we implemented rate in 28 states with an average increase of 9.3% and a weighted Allstate Brand Auto premium impact of 3.6%. When you combine that with the fourth quarter actions, we've increased weighted rates by 6.5% over the last 6 months, and that equates to a gross annualized written premium impact of $1.6 billion within the Allstate brand.  About 95% of our premiums in the U.S. are coming from 6-month term policies. So the rates will improve margins, but there's a lag between when the rates are implemented and they're ultimately earned, which you can see in the chart on the right, which estimates when the rate increases taken in the last 6 months will be earned into premium. That illustration assumes only 85% of the annualized premium will be earned to account for things like retention and the fact that customers modify their policy terms when faced with a price increase, like changing deductibles or limits.  As you can see, looking at Q1 2022, the rate increases we've taken didn't have a whole lot of impact yet, but you can see it coming in the coming quarters, and it really accelerates. We expect to see significant increases in earned premium beginning in the second half, reaching over $1.1 billion by the first quarter of next year based on the implemented rate so far. And keep in mind that additional rates and increases that we take through this year will be additive and compound on those rate increases. And given the ongoing inflationary pressure, we have increased the magnitude of rate increases we expect to take in the rest of 2022.  We remain very confident in our ability to restore auto profitability to targeted levels, and we'll keep you posted on that in our new monthly disclosures of rate filings.  So let's move to Slide 9 and take a look at something that I think is an undervalued strength at Allstate. It's our industry-leading homeowners business. As you know, a significant portion of our customers bundle home and auto, and that improves the retention and overall economics of both lines of business. We've differentiated our homeowners product and our homeowners capability really, and that goes to our product, our underwriting, our reinsurance, our claims ecosystem. It is a unique entire business model and system in the industry. The graph on the left shows the history of Allstate brand combined ratio in homeowners versus the industry and competitors. And we believe that in order to achieve an adequate return on the capital that's required in this particular line of business, you have to achieve a recorded combined ratio over time at a target of 90% or better. And as you can see from the Allstate dots on that chart, we have a long history of doing exactly that. You can also see that some of our large competitors and the industry as a whole consistently generate combined ratios that don't meet what we find as a definition of needed for a return on capital.  We've repositioned the homeowners business over a multiyear period by reducing exposure to unprofitable geographies, designing new products, creating highly sophisticated pricing plans, improving home inspection and risk selection process and sourcing capital through multiyear reinsurance programs. As a result of all of that, we've consistently generated excellent underwriting results. Since 2017, we've earned $3.3 billion or about $667 million annually in underwriting income with the industry generating an underwriting loss over that same period. Homeowners Insurance and Allstate's Homeowners Insurance is certainly not immune to the rising inflationary environment right now, though. And we see that in the form of higher labor costs and higher material costs. But our products have the sophisticated pricing features needed to respond to those changes and replacement values and help offset the impact.  The chart on the right shows key Allstate Brand Homeowners Insurance operating statistics. And there, you'll see that our net written premium has grown sharply through 2021 and into 2022, increasing 17% from the prior year. We grew policies in force by 1.7% in the first quarter. And our Allstate agents continue to be in a really good spot to broaden customer relationships with homeowners. And our average premiums rose 14.3%, mostly driven by increasing property values, as I mentioned earlier.  The first quarter combined ratio of 83.3% generated $368 million of underwriting income for the Allstate brand. In short, our property insurance business is a competitive advantage, and we aim to continue to leverage that advantage and grow it. And we look forward to sharing additional insights on homeowners with you during our upcoming special topic call on June 16.  And with that, I will turn it over to Mario. Great. And thanks for the question, Josh. So it is definitely 2 different stories on the auto and home, as Tom mentioned. So auto, the first quarter is the shopping quarter in nonstandard auto. It's by far the biggest shopping quarter and our National General team did a really nice job of being in the market in the right places in the places they felt they had good profitability and the right pricing and growing effectively. So think of that one as -- and you're right, it's shorter duration business in terms of lifetime value, but that is their business model and they make a good return on those policies. So they grew auto in that way. . As Tom just mentioned, on the homeowner side, this has been a shift to the homeowner strategy in NatGen time that we're in we're really taking the Allstate strength and making it a strength of NatGen. So they've had to get some pricing in there. They haven't -- they've shrunk a bit in homeowners, but that's setting ourselves up for than the strategy part of this, which is as we get our middle-market products based on that Allstate data and the Allstate capabilities into the independent agent channel marketed as National General and Allstate company, the endorsed branding, that we think we have a really great opportunity to grow homeowners with the Allstate level of sophistication and pricing and all the things I talked about in the opening remarks. But in a channel, we really haven't meaningfully been in before. So that's the path forward. But as we sit from a 1-quarter basis, we're still in, I guess, correction mode of the homeowners business there, but in a really good quarter and in a really good place from a nonstandard auto standpoint. I would just add that if you look at -- when you're talking about the premium growth there, it is 2 things in large part. One is, we've raised rates in sort of the traditional small commercial business we have. So rates are materially up, units are not. The other is that a year ago, transportation business is -- because we have -- the charge by mile and we pay them for the usage. A year ago, there was very little usage still in those transportation networks, and there's a lot more usage and therefore, a lot more premium right now. And we have raised, as Tom said, we've gotten out of some states and we've raised rates on those. So we think the profitability go forward is better. So it's not growth in that we're piling on business as we've gotten a lot more revenue coming through. Tom, did you want to start on that? Or do you want me to? Yes. So I'll start with how it unfolded. I mean -- I would say, we continue to see inflation run like a lot of people continue to see. We continue to see elongated time frames for development, including prior year development. And so we're taking, I think, an appropriately conservative view and saying that like we're going to need more rate on that part of it. The other part on the precision, I want to build on what Tom said, because it's an important point because we do use a lot of precision.  And I think that there some folks who talk more -- or some companies talk more or less about their level of segmentation and precision. We maybe don't do a good enough job talking about the depth that we have in terms of our segmentation, which is highly sophisticated and that's what Tom is going into. But it's sophistication at that level, but also on the go-to-market level. Because clearly, we kept marketing open, and we took an opportunity to grow some business that the economics were good on. We did that because the marketing cost itself was down with others leaving that area. There were a lot of shoppers and first quarter tends to be a time that a lot of people shop. . Now we also did that with a lot of precision. It's the entire go-to-market system because we're not just -- to sort of have the open sign everywhere. It is -- we're marketing precisely where we know we have a lifetime value return based on risk type based on market within state level. And it's a combination of underwriting, marketing, pricing that all comes together -- and distribution that all comes together with how we go to market and drive where we want to grow and how we want to grow that I think goes into the need for rate as well. Yes. So one, and if you saw the -- I'll go to the National General first, we saw that National General underlying combined ratio looked pretty good in the first quarter. And one of the things that they have that's really stable is fee structure. The fee structure is a nonrate element that turns out to be really stable over time and helps them predict and plan for their combined ratio. When I think about nonrate actions across the Allstate book, it really goes back to what I was talking about where it's about -- I don't like to isolate it to the word underwriting because then it sounds like you're sort of deciding to write or not to write as opposed to getting the right level of rate for each type of risk, but that also goes into with underwriting and marketing and distribution how you go to market.  And where we've really built our sophistication is in how our marketing team, our underwriting and product teams and pricing and our distribution organization deploy resources quickly and nimbly to where and how we're looking to grow. And I think that in itself generates a lot of the long-term economic value that we drive. Yes. So there's a few parts to that because I'll talk more macro about the auto -- the car park out there and like the whole system. With every new model year newer that we get and every year that passes, we've done the math through what's in our book of business, what type of safety elements are in cars, accident avoidance, technology and everything. And we know 2 things: one, that we get a little bit of a tailwind with every year that passes on frequency, and we get a little bit of a headwind on severity because they're more expensive to fix, more sensors and so on. And the reason I started there is that would be true of this example as well. The fact that our book of business tends to trend that way more, it will give us a little bit of a sustainable benefit on frequency in comparison to others, and it will give us a little bit of a sustainable headwind on the severity.  But we do charge premium based on make and model year and you get a higher premium for it. It was more of a statement in that opening that as we look at and we try to put our trends, whether we're looking at Fast Track or looking at public disclosures, when we look at our trends on bodily injury or property damage, which are third-party vehicles, and then collision first-party vehicles, we see some of that difference come through and then have to like do the math back to our premium and ensure that we're getting the right rates for all of that. Yes. So first, I always start with I think we're accountable for the recorded combined ratio because ultimately, if we always had a good underlying but like we hadn't gotten the right reinsurance or we hadn't been in the right locations, and we hadn't done good risk mapping for wildfire or hail or hurricane or any other exposure and we were constantly running what the industry or key competitors run. I think you would rightfully hold us accountable for that. So I always go back to the recorded combined ratio. That said, the underlying, as Tom said, it moves up and down a little bit, and we do watch that primarily though we watch the recorded combined ratio.  Right now, like Tom, I feel really good about where we are. Severity ran hot in the first quarter. It's tough to look at one quarter in homeowners and draw a lot of conclusions because there's a decent amount of volatility between the mix of perils in homeowners. It's not nearly as stable as auto in that way. And so we're watching that, that was a high number, but we got an average price increase, average earned premium of 14.3% burning through, which really ticked up in the latter part of the year last year. So we'll continue to give us benefit as that earns through. And we're in -- obviously, we're really good shape in homeowners, and I feel good about it. I'll just add if you take the long term and the short term, the long term first, as Tom said, our expanded customer access, our work on improving value as we get the 3 points at cost that Mario talked about out and we've got access into all these systems, and we get middle market products into the IA channel and our exclusive agents are humming, we've got a really good long-term prognosis on that. . With your question, you were asking, I think, some about the short term. So as you think about what we did early this year, we pulled marketing dollars forward, and we've talked about the fact that we pulled them forward. That's not the same as increasing them. It did increase in the quarter, but it's pulling it forward. That means it does have to come out of somewhere, too. We decided to do that because there were good economics on the marketing. A number of companies publicly talked about pulling back from marketing that left from the supply and demand curve of marketing costs that left it reasonable, and there was good economics on it, plus a lot of business gets sold in the first quarter.  So we thought with a lot of shoppers in the market with rates out there, that it would be a good time to be in the market where we had our prices in, and we felt good about the lifetime value. That said, inflation is continuing to run and we're taking more rate, and we pulled that money forward from later. So marketing will reduce from this point and that could have a short-term impact on new business growth, plus we've got -- everybody will have headwinds on retention with the amount of rate that's in the system across the industry. Yes, I'll take it. Yes. So it's definitely earned basis in that we look at our when you look at combined ratios, it's on an earned basis. So you're hitting a really important point. So it's an astute observation. Because I think about that disclosure and you could look at -- when you look at the percentage of states that are above 100, for example, that is not the same as looking at the way we look at where do we want to grow. Because the state could be above 100 right now, but we've just gotten in the rate we feel we need to be adequate. So any new business we put on is going to be at a rate adequate level that we like, and we would want to grow there. So it really does lag and you have to go back to Page 8 and see where that -- which we don't -- because that's an estimate. We don't estimate every state and disclose based on when we'll earn the premiums and what percentage will earn by state and what that will do. But the point is, while that's a snapshot of where we are today, that does not reflect all of the written premiums and increases that we've got. ."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Glenn. Let's move to Slide 10, where we'll discuss how we're improving customer value through cost reductions. The chart on the slide shows the adjusted expense ratio, which is a metric we introduced a couple of quarters ago. This starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-Liability business.  Through innovation and strong execution, we've achieved more than 3 points of improvement since 2018. Over time, we expect to drive an additional 2 points of improvement from rent levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024. This represents approximately a 6-point reduction compared to 2018, enabling an improved competitive position relative to our competitors while maintaining attractive returns. While the adjusted expense ratio increased compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher employee-related costs, we remain committed to our 3-year reduction goals.  Not included in this measure, but in the reported expense ratio was an increase in advertising expenses versus the prior year quarter as we took advantage of a drop in advertising costs and a seasonal increase in direct shopping to ship spending earlier in the year. Advertising will fluctuate throughout the year as we implement auto price increases and could impact near-term growth. Our future cost reduction efforts are focused on digitization, sourcing and operating efficiency and distribution-related costs.  Slide 11, diagrams Transformative Growth with increase market share. This multiyear initiative is designed to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by delivering on 5 key objectives: improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, deploying new technology ecosystems and enhancing organizational capabilities. We made significant progress across each objective in 2021 and are continuing the momentum in 2022.  While the current auto operating environment required rapid price increases, we are confident this plan will generate long-term growth. Starting at the top of the flywheel, we have reduced expenses to improve customer value with more competitive prices while earning target returns. We are building simple, affordable and connected protection solutions that are competitively differentiated. We have enhanced and expanded distribution, including modifying the Allstate agent model to increase growth and decrease distribution costs. We also improved the strength of our direct channel capabilities by leveraging the Allstate brand and significantly expanded in the independent agent channel through National General.  Differentiated products and expanded distribution are supported by increased marketing sophistication and investment. New technology ecosystems lower cost, support protection offerings and improved service and speed to market. This comprehensive approach is like a flywheel that creates sustainable competitive advantage, leading to market share growth. At the bottom of the page, you can see the 5 cases of Transformative Growth. We continue to make meaningful progress as we execute on building the new model in Phase III and begin to scale the new model in Phase 4.  Moving to Slide 12. You can see how expanding customer access better meets customer demand. Starting on the bar on the lower left, you can see the auto insurance industry written premium distribution by channel in 2020 was roughly 1/3 exclusive agency, 1/3 direct and 1/3 independent agency. Allstate's pre Transformative Growth distribution auto new business as of year-end 2019 is shown in the middle bar in Allstate's first quarter 2022 distribution is shown on the right. As you can see, today, the distribution of new business more closely mirrors the industry due to Transformative Growth and the acquisition of National General. The National General acquisition significantly increased our presence in the independent agent channel and offers future growth potential by expanding middle-market product offerings. Direct sales capabilities were improved and expanded from the Esurance base, including the use of the Allstate Brand with lower pricing in this channel.  Allstate agents are and will continue to be the competitive strength as an incentive shift to growth and costs are reduced. Today, the source of new business matches customer preferences and drove a 14% increase in new business applications in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter.  Slide 13 shows the profitable growth of Protection Services. Revenues, which exclude the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives increased 13.6% to $627 million in the quarter. The increase in revenues was driven by continued growth at Allstate Protection Plans, generating a 19.6% increase in revenues to $329 million compared to the prior year quarter. Policies in force also increased 4.7%, reflecting growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Identity Protection. Protection Services policies in force of $147 million are approximately 4x that of property liability, showing how ubiquitous the Allstate brand is becoming. Adjusted net income of $53 million for the first quarter of 2022 increased $4 million compared to the prior year quarter after generating $179 million of adjusted net income for all of 2021.  Moving to Slide 14. Allstate Health and Benefits standing product offering generated growth and income. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual health products to our portfolio, as you can see on the left. Revenues of $581 million in the first quarter of 2022 increased 4.9% to the prior year quarter, driven by higher premiums and contract charges and other revenue, primarily in Group Hub. Adjusted net income of $53 million decreased $12 million from the prior year quarter, driven by increased individual and group health lifes.  Now let's shift to Slide 15, which highlights our investment performance in the reduction of fixed income duration to reduce enterprise exposure to inflation. Net investment income totaled $594 million in the quarter, which is $114 million below the prior year quarter as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income, shown in dark blue, was $72 million below the prior year quarter, but 2021 was an exceptional year for private equity markets and reported income. While results are lower compared to a strong prior year, the performance-based annualized yield of 14% in the first quarter is above long-term average performance. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $31 million below the prior year quarter. As we've discussed, our market-based portfolio yield has declined in the lower interest rate environment over the last few years, with reinvestment rates below our average fixed income portfolio yield. The fixed income yield was further reduced by actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2021 to lower portfolio duration and reduce the negative impact higher inflation and interest rates would have on our fixed income portfolio valuations.  The chart on the right illustrates our proactive management of interest rate exposure over the interest rate cycle. After shortening duration late in the fourth quarter of 2021, we further reduced duration by 0.7 years in the first quarter. The increase in interest rates in the quarter decreased our fixed income valuations by $2 billion, resulting in a negative portfolio return of 2.8%. However, our interest rate risk mitigation lowered the negative impact of higher interest rates by approximately $800 million versus our position at the end of the third quarter of last year. The shorter duration portfolio also positions us to reinvest in higher market yields as interest rates continue to rise.  Now let's move to Slide 16, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position. Adjusted net income return on equity of 12.8% was below the prior year period due to lower auto insurance underwriting income. Allstate's strong capital position continues to enable significant cash returns to shareholders. We returned $1 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2022. Common shares outstanding were reduced by 8.1% over the last 12 months, 16.9% since 2018 and 45% since 2011, reflecting our history of providing strong cash returns to shareholders.  As of March 31, 2022, we had $2.5 million remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by early 2023.  With that context, let's open up the line for questions. Yes. If I can just add, Greg, this is Mario. First, I guess, where I'd start is, the objective of providing that rate information monthly that we started this year was really to create a level of transparency into what we were doing with auto profitability with rates being such a significant lever and provide you all with a view of the progress we're making but also some color around what we're seeing on a forward-looking basis. So that's the objective. And the language we used in the most recent disclosure provided, I think, some additional context.  In terms of what's happening, I think we continue to look at loss trends month-in and month-out, both in terms of reserve levels, severe trends and just loss trends overall. And the statement we made in our most recent release was really a reflection of what we were seeing in loss trends in severity development both in terms of what we saw in last year, we strengthened reserves by $151 million in auto this quarter and what we were seeing in terms of the physical damage severity escalation as well as what -- how that translated into current year severity. So we're taking that data. We're looking at it. We're working with the pricing team and factoring it into our outlook and the purpose of the disclosure again is to tell you what we did, but also provide a little more texture around what we're seeing in the market. . No, I think that's right, Tom. So I wouldn't read too much into any one quarter. We still have $2.5 billion left to buy. We said we'll complete it by early next year, and that's the point."

After prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please be aware this call is being recorded. And now, I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrent Vandermause: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. And welcome to Allstate\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and our strategy. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement, and forward-looking statements about Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I will turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning. And we appreciate you taking the time and spending your efforts to explore why Allstate is an attractive investment. So I will begin with an overview of our strategy and results, and Mario and Jess, can go through the operating performance. Then we will have time for your questions at the end. Let\u2019s begin on slide two, which depicts Allstate\u2019s strategy to increase shareholder value. So we have two components to this strategy, increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the fourth quarter. We generated net income of $1.5 billion. The strong results reflect our actions to improve auto insurance profitability and mild weather conditions, which was a welcome reprieve from the elevated level of weather related losses in the first three quarters of the year. The proactive approach to increasing bond duration also contributed to strong results with higher income from the market based portfolio. To further increase shareholder value this year, we remain focused on improving auto insurance profitability. There is more work to be done, but we are well on our way. Additional shareholder value will then be increased by increasing policies in-force across all of our businesses. The transformative growth initiatives to drive Property-Liability market share growth can be implemented in more states this year now as auto margins have been improved. We are also focusing on expanding protection offerings to Protection Services businesses, which is shown in the lower oval as Protection Plans, Identity Protection, Roadside and Arity, all have good growth prospects. As you know, we started the process to sell the Health and Benefits business and that process is proceeding on schedule. Let\u2019s review the financial results on slide three. Revenues of $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter increased by 8.7%. That reflects a 10.7% increase in Property-Liability earned premium and that was due to rate increases in 2022 and -- mostly in 2022, and in 2023 in both the auto and homeowners\u2019 insurances. Net investment income in the quarter was $604 million, an 8.4% increase, reflecting higher fixed-income yields and duration extension, which is partially offset by lower performance based income. The strong profitability in the quarter generated adjusted net income of $1.5 billion or $5.82 per diluted share. Annual revenues of $57 billion were up $5.7 billion or 11.1% over the prior year. Strong fourth quarter earnings resulted in positive adjusted net income for the year. Slide four summarizes the status of the four-part auto insurance profit improvement plan. Strong execution resulted in 6.7% point improvement in the combined ratio in 2023. Starting with rates. Since 2022, the Allstate brand implemented rate increases 33.3%, which included 16.4% in 2023 and 6.9% in the fourth quarter, driven by the recent approvals in California, New York and New Jersey. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022 and an additional 12.8% in 2023. Looking forward, we will pursue rate increases in 10 states to improve margins and in other states to keep pace with increases in loss costs. Expense reductions were initiated in 2019 as part of the transformative growth plan to become a low cost provider of protections, being early in this effort helped offset the rapid inflation in loss costs. The underwriting expense ratio decreased 1.1 points in 2023 compared to the prior year when you exclude the large decline in advertising that was directly linked to lower profitability. Looking forward, further cost reductions will improve efficiencies and our competitive price position. Given the significant improvement in perspective, auto margins will increase advertising investment this year. In addition, we implemented underwriting actions to restrict new business, where we were not achieving target returns. We are moving some underwriting restrictions as rate adequacy is achieved. Finally, enhancing claim practices in a high inflation and increasingly litigious environment are required to deliver good customer value. This includes accelerating the settlement of injury claims and increasing in-person inspections. This program has positioned us to increase new business levels and begin to grow policies in-force in sales where acceptable margins have been restored. Now I will turn it over to Mario to discuss Property-Liability.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s start on slide five. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by, excuse me, higher average premiums from rate increases, partially offset by a 2% decline in policies in-force. Underwriting income of $1.3 billion in the quarter improved $2.4 billion compared to the prior year quarter due to increased premiums earned, improved underlying loss experience, lower catastrophe losses and operating efficiencies. The chart on the right highlights the components of the 89.5 combined ratio in the quarter, which improved 19.6 points from the prior year quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve re-estimates on the combined ratio as shown in light blue and gray materially improved compared to the prior year. Catastrophe losses of $68 million were $711 million or 6.3 points lower than prior year due to the mild weather conditions experienced in the quarter and favorable loss development from prior period events. Prior year reserve re-estimates, excluding catastrophes, were unfavorable and totaled $199 million, representing a 1.6-point adverse combined ratio impact in the quarter and a 0.9-point favorable impact compared to the prior year quarter. Approximately $148 million related to personal auto driven in part by costs related to claims in litigation and adverse development in National General. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9, improved by 12.3 points compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher average premium and the favorable influence of milder weather conditions on accident frequency. Despite the favorable results in the quarter, the full year combined ratio of 104.5 was significantly impacted by elevated catastrophe losses primarily from events in the first three quarters, resulting in a catastrophe loss ratio that was 4 points above the 10-year average from 2013 to 2022. Now let\u2019s move to slide six to review Allstate\u2019s auto insurance profit trends. The fourth quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 98.9 improved by 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earned premium, lower underlying losses, lower adverse prior year reserve re-estimates and expense efficiencies. The chart shows the underlying combined ratios from 2022 and 2023 with quarterly reported figures adjusted to reflect the estimated average severity level as of year-end for each year. As you can see, the underlying combined ratio decreased each quarter in 2023, reflecting the benefits of the profit improvement plan, Tom discussed earlier. As a reminder, we continually reassess claim severity expectations as the year progresses. If the current year expected severity increases or decreases, the year-to-date impact of that change is recorded in the current quarter, despite a portion of that impact being driven by reassessment of the prior quarters. In 2023, the full year estimate of claim severity decreased in the fourth quarter. So there was a benefit from prior quarters included in reported results in the fourth quarter. When you adjust for this, the reported underlying combined ratio of 96.4, as shown in the table would be 98.2 as shown in the bar on the graph. The three preceding quarters all benefit from the adjustments, including Q3, which improved from 100.5 in the presentation shown last quarter to 99.9, reflecting the latest severity estimates. While loss cost trends remain historically elevated, the rate of increase moderated in the second half of the year, mainly in physical damage coverages. Allstate brand weighted-average major coverage severity expectations improved from 11% as of the end of the second quarter to 9% in the third quarter and now that 8% to 9% at the end of the year. As a reminder, this trend reflects our current best estimate for the year-over-year increase in average severity. Slide seven shows the impact of our profit improvement actions across the country. As shown on the left, Allstate\u2019s brand rate increases have exceeded 33% over the last eight quarters, including larger increases in California, New York, New Jersey and Texas, reflective of the elevated loss trends in these states. These four states comprised 36% of Allstate brand auto total written premiums in the U.S. during 2023. As you know, increases were approved in California, New York and New Jersey in December. So we have yet to see this in earned premiums. The chart on the right shows states with an underlying combined ratio below 100, shown in the light and dark blue bars were 65% of the total in 2023, more than doubling from the percentage at year-end 2022. Excluding California, New York, and New Jersey, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 in 2023. Slide eight shows improving profitability had a negative impact on policies in-force during 2023. On the left, you can see that total Protection Auto policies in-force, decreased by 2.9% compared to prior year, as the Allstate brand decline of 6.2% more than offset a 13.3% increase at National General. Allstate brand auto policies in-force decreased due to reduced new business volumes and lower retention. National General growth of 581,000 policies in-force was mostly driven by non-standard auto insurance and to a lesser extent, the rollout of new middle-market standard and preferred auto insurance product launches for the Custom 360 products. The chart on the right shows total personal auto new issued applications for 2023 decreased 6% compared to the prior year and the accompanying drivers. Targeted profitability actions within the Allstate brand resulted in a decline in new auto issued applications of 20% compared to the prior year. The first two red bars reflect the impact of lower new business volume in California, New York and New Jersey, as well as the direct channel decline in the remainder of the country, which was most directly impacted by the reduction in marketing investment last year. Outside of the three states where profit actions significantly reduced new business, Allstate exclusive agents increased production by 6%, driven by higher productivity, showing the response of Allstate agents to the changes we have made to incent growth and the opportunity to continue to grow with our agency owners as part of transformative growth. The acquisition of National General strategically positioned Allstate to grow in the independent agent channel with new business applications, increasing 12% in 2023. National General continues to grow non-standard auto and generate higher volume from the Custom 360 product launches. Slide nine covers homeowners\u2019 insurance results, which generated significant profits for the quarter, while full year results were impacted by elevated catastrophe losses in the first three quarters of the year. On the left you can see net written premium increased 13.3% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the National General and Allstate Brands, and a 1.1% increase in policies in-force. National General net written premium grew 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to policy in-force growth, driven by the Custom 360 offering and higher average premiums from implemented rate increases. Allstate brand net written premiums increased 12.5%, driven by average gross written premium per policy increases of 12.2% compared to the prior year quarter and a small increase in policies in-force. Allstate agents continue to bundle auto and homeowners\u2019 insurance at historically high levels. Catastrophe losses of $21 million in the fourth quarter were low by historical standards, reflecting milder weather conditions and favorable development from prior events contributing to a 62 combined ratio and $1.2 billion of underwriting income for the quarter. Milder weather in the fourth quarter also favorably influenced the underlying combined ratio due to lower non-catastrophe claim frequency. For the full year, higher catastrophe losses drove the combined ratio increase in 2023 compared to 2022. Full year catastrophe losses of $4.5 billion were higher than our historical experience and translated to a catastrophe loss ratio that was 17 points higher than prior year and roughly 14 points above the 10-year average from 2013 to 2022. As you can see from the chart on the right, the full year underlying combined ratio declined from 70.3 in 2022 to 67.3 in 2023, reflecting higher average premiums from rate increases, partially offset by higher claims severity due to materials and labor costs. With an industry-leading product, advanced pricing, underwriting and analytics, broad distribution capabilities and a comprehensive reinsurance program, we will continue to leverage homeowners as a growth opportunity and remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in this line. Moving to slide 10, let\u2019s discuss how we are advancing transformative growth to provide customers low-cost protection through broad distribution. We remain focused on four key elements of this multiyear initiative, as you can see on this slide. We have improved our cost structure to enhance our competitive price position. In the current environment with most competitors taking large rate increases, it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint competitive position. That said, our relative competitive position likely deteriorated in 2023. But as many of our competitors continue to implement rate increases and our expenses decline, we believe our competitive position will improve enhancing growth opportunities as part of transformative growth. Redesigned, affordable, simple and connected products currently available for auto insurance in seven states with plans for further expansion this year, both improve customer value and deliver a differentiated customer experience. National General independent agent growth prospects will be further enhanced by expanding Custom 360 products, which were live in 16 states as of year-end 2023 and expect to be in nearly every state by the end of 2024. Expanding customer access will also support market share growth and we have made good progress in all three channels. Increasing sophistication and customer acquisition continues to advance and will improve the effectiveness of increased advertising spend in 2024, as we look to grow in more states. A new technology ecosystem is also being deployed to improve the customer experience, speed-to-market and reduce costs for legacy technology platforms. Let me turn it over to Jess now to talk about expense reductions and other operating results.\nJesse Merten: All right. Thank you, Mario. On slide 11 we delve deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. As shown in the chart on the left, the Property-Liability underwriting expense ratio decreased two points from 2022 to 2023 as we continue to focus on lowering costs to provide more value to customers and some of the benefits of higher earned premium growth relative to fixed costs. The right half of the chart provides additional context on the drivers of the 1.3-point improvement in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first red bar shows the two-tenth of a point impact from increased advertising spend, reflecting the slight increase was driven by seasonal investment changes and growth investments in rate adequacy states. The second green bar shows the 1.4 -- 1.4-point decline in operating costs, which was mainly driven by lower employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums relative to fixed costs in the quarter. Shifting to the longer term trend in the chart on the right, we remain committed to reducing the adjusted expense ratio as part of transformative growth. As a reminder, the adjusted expense ratio starts with our underwriting expense ratio, which I just covered and excludes restructuring COVID-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising expense. It then adds our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims. Those expenses are excluded because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate. Through innovation, process improvement and strong execution, we have driven significant improvement in expenses for the fourth quarter and year-end 2023 adjusted expense ratio of 24.7. This reflects decreases in both the underwriting expense and non-cat claims expense ratio compared to the prior year quarter. Now moving to slide 12, I will cover investment results. This quarter showed how our proactive approach to duration management benefits results. The chart on the left shows changes we made in the duration of the bond portfolio in comparison to bond market yields, from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, lowering fixed-income duration, mitigated losses as rates rose. Beginning in Q4 of 2022, we began to extend duration which when combined with higher yields has increased market-based income. Our fixed income yield, shown in the table below the chart, remains below the current intermediate corporate bond yield, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields as we continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows into higher interest rates. The bar chart on the right shows the income and total return benefits of these decisions. As you can see in the table on the chart, the total return of our portfolio was 4.6% in the fourth quarter and 6.7% for the year. Portfolio returns in both periods reflect income earned, as well as higher fixed income valuations due to the decline in market yields in the fourth quarter. Net investment income totaled $604 million in the quarter, which was $47 million above the fourth quarter of last year. Market based income of $604 million shown in blue, was $140 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting the repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration and the benefit from higher yielding assets that sustainably increase income. Market based income also benefit -- benefited from higher fixed-income balances. Performance based income of $60 million shown in black, was 87 million below the prior year quarter due to lower valuation increases and fewer sales of underlying assets. As we have stated previously, the performance based portfolio is expected to enhance long-term returns as demonstrated through our five-year and 10-year internal rates of return of 12% and volatility in these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected. Slide 13 covers results for our Protection Services businesses. Revenue in these businesses increased 11.8% to $719 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This result is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans, which increased 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded product breadth and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $4 million in the fourth quarter decreased $34 million as compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease is attributable to the results of a state income tax examination that increased the effective state tax rate that we apply, which increased deferred income taxes by $43 million in the quarter for future tax payments and Protection Services, largely related to dealer services. The impact of the tax change on the enterprise was a net benefit of $6 million. We do not anticipate that these tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our ongoing operations. Shifting now to slide 14, our Health and Benefits businesses continue to generate profitable growth. From the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue of $630 million increased by $50 million compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in individual health, group health, as well as fees and other revenue. Adjusted net income of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, increased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter as individual health revenue growth partially offset higher benefit ratios in group health. As you know, late last year, we announced a decision to pursue the divestiture of our Health and Benefits business following the successful integration of Allstate\u2019s voluntary benefits business in National General\u2019s Group and individual health businesses. We continue to anticipate a transaction will be completed in 2024. We will close on slide 15 by reviewing Allstate\u2019s financial condition and capital position. Allstate\u2019s proactive capital management approach provides the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to navigate a challenging operating environment, while providing support for long-term value creation. Fourth quarter results demonstrated the company\u2019s capital generation capabilities with a statutory surplus in holding company assets of $18 billion, increasing by $1.6 billion compared to the prior quarter. Assets held at the holding company also increased to $3.4 billion. The increase to the prior quarter primarily reflects a return of capital from National General statutory entities, partially offset by common shareholder dividends. Additionally, GAAP shareholders\u2019 equity of $17.8 billion increased $3.2 billion compared to the prior quarter, reflecting $1.5 billion of GAAP net income and the improved unrealized position on fixed income securities of $1.9 billion. We continue to proactively manage capital, make progress on the comprehensive profit improvement plan and invest in transformative growth. We remain confident that these strategic actions will generate attractive shareholder returns. With that as context, let\u2019s open it up for your questions.\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey. Good morning. So I had a couple of questions. First, can you talk about rate adequacy in California, New York, New Jersey, the new business that you are issuing there now is that adequate price for normal profitability or are you assuming that you are going to need another sort of stab at it in 2024 to get the normal profits?\nTom Wilson: Thank you, Jimmy. I will let, Mario, really three different stories, Mario will take you through those in, then we will do a follow-up question, and I would just remind everybody, we like -- ask one question with a follow-up, hopefully, related to the first question. But so we can make sure we get through everybody\u2019s call. So, Mario, you...\nMario Rizzo: Yeah. So, Jimmy, first thing I\u2019d say is, we have talked a lot last quarter about the actions we needed to take in the three states, California, New York and New Jersey. I will start with a view that says, look our objective is to meet the protection needs of as many customers in as many states as possible. When that can happen, we think customers are served well, markets operate effectively and we can operate our business to achieve the appropriate levels of returns. We had rate pending in all three of those states and I will just spend a minute kind of giving you the story in each one of those, because I think it\u2019s slightly different. In California, you will remember we filed a 35% rate. We got approval for 30 %. But we got approval earlier than our expected effective date. So, effectively, we filed our full rate need and got approval for our full rate need. As of yesterday, we are writing business in California, again across all channels and we feel comfortable writing business in California given the rate level that we are operating. Now, of course, having said that, we have got to stay on top of loss trends going forward and we will do that, but we are comfortable with the rate level, we have gotten California that have opened up that market. In New Jersey, it\u2019s kind of the opposite story we filed for 29 points of rate, we got approval for just under 17%. And as a result of that, we are going to continue to take the more restrictive underwriting actions that we have been taking in New Jersey, which means we will continue to get smaller in New Jersey, while we plan on filing additional rate as a matter of fact, we have two rates pending with the New Jersey Department and depending on how those things shake out that that will inform future actions we take in New Jersey. But as of right now, we will continue to get smaller in New Jersey, just given the lack of rate adequacy. And New York is kind of somewhere in between, we got approval for a 14.6% rate in December. We have implemented that, that helps. But we still need more rate. We are actively engaged with the department and intend to file our full rate need going forward and do that in reasonably short order. And again, depending on how that plays out, that will inform the next set of actions we have taken in New York.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just a follow-up, maybe slightly related and slightly unrelated, in those three states, if you are raising prices a lot, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that you would suffer in terms of discount or at least at a minimum, it wouldn\u2019t grow. But how is your PIF faring in the states where you are not taking any outsized rate actions versus what some of your peers are taking and just trying to assess whether you think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that your overall PIF count stabilizes at some point this year for the company as a whole and potentially grows this year, later in the year or next year.\nTom Wilson: Jimmy, this is Tom. I will start and then Mario can give -- can add on to that. I would say that the current competitive environment is still in flux. So, we raise our rates 30 points in California. State Farm gets another increase somewhere after that. So it\u2019s too early to tell what impact that will have on volume in 2024. We do -- our goal, though, is obviously to, one, make good money for our shareholders as first part, and as Jess said, the other part is, we need to grow. So we are -- we think we have got transformative growth in place, which is differentiated in a long-term growth plan, as well as some of the short-term things you are talking about here. Mario, what would you add to that?\nMario Rizzo: Yeah. I think, specifically, on retention, Jimmy, as Tom mentioned, in the three states we talked about, those markets are still in a bit of a state of flux. One state I\u2019d point to, to kind of tell the story about retention and how taking outsized rates and then kind of lapping that impacts retention is Texas. We took significant rates in Texas in 2022 and earlier in 2023 and we showed you last quarter there was a pretty substantial hit to retention in Texas. As we have lapped those rates, we have seen a nice bounce back which contributed to the sequential improvement in the fourth quarter retention level in auto relative to Q3. So, once the rate need stabilizes, that certainly has a positive impact on retention going forward. And hopefully, as we in more and more states are really just keeping on top of loss trend, we would expect the headwind that we faced in retention to diminish going forward.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question please.\nGregory Peters: Okay. Good morning, everyone. I -- for my first question, I\u2019d like to focus on transformative growth and it\u2019s kind of counter intuitive, right, because you are talking about lowering expenses at the same time growing your policy count. So when I think of some of the headwinds going forward on expenses, I think, of increased agent commission because profitability is going up. I see maybe the potential for increased advertising expense. So maybe you can help us pull together on how you see growth emerging at a lower expense base?\nTom Wilson: Greg, I will start and Mario can jump in. So I don\u2019t know that, I think, there is counterintuitive that as you grow your expenses can\u2019t go down, and I would point out, if you look at National General, its growth has helped drive more scale and has brought its expenses down. So that\u2019s just a scale-related comment to it. As you relate -- you look at the programs we have in place on transformative growth, it\u2019s really across the Board. Everywhere we are at where programs that are -- we have been working on for three plus years and they are rolling out as we go. For example, we are cutting costs by becoming more digital. By becoming more digital, we can move more jobs either get rid of the jobs or move them offshore. That\u2019s a multiyear thing. You don\u2019t just take first notice of loss and change it in three months. So the benefits of those programs, which we have been working and rolling those out for the last 18 months really still will get more of those benefits as we go forward in 2024 just based on the work we have already done. In terms of agent commission, Mario mentioned this, we have changed the agent commission structure such that it pays more for new business and less for renewals and that was one of the core parts of transformative growth was how do we distribute our products at a lower price and still give people the value of an agent. And people want an agent to buy the stuff, they don\u2019t necessarily want to pay as much for attention. One of the underlying assumptions we validated with transformer growth, which quite honestly, a number of analysts and other people were not so sure, but you are going to keep agents head in the game? And the answer is, yes. Look at the productivity numbers that Mario showed. Do they like having renewal compensation go down? No. Do our customers like having a better priced product? Yes. And so we choose to do what our customers want and they have worked through that. So we have a series of things that go on. Now, we do spend money, but like -- we are doing our expenses to, first, take care of our customers, second, build long-term value. We are not running our expenses to make a particular P&L number in a quarter. We just don\u2019t do that. We cut advertising, as you pointed out, because there was no sense growing if you are losing money on the product. It wasn\u2019t because we were trying to make some combined ratio target. It certainly helped that. But we are like, why go out and advertise if you are going to write it at 105 combined ratio. So we think about it economically first and in terms of creating long-term value. Mario, do you want to talk about how you are thinking about expenses and where you go this year?\nMario Rizzo: Yeah. So, Greg, I think, when you combine the pieces that Tom talked about, I think, you can get comfortable that we can continue to improve our expense ratio and our cost structure to get more competitively priced and invest in marketing at the same time. So when I think about the broad areas where we are looking to get more efficient and where we have gotten more efficient over the last several years, first, distribution costs. So when you look at the progress we have made on creating a lower cost but more productive Allstate agency distribution system. We are really happy with the progress we have made there. And I have talked a little bit earlier about the increases in overall production. But underneath that, the even more significant increases in average productivity as we have fewer agents producing more volume today than was the case a couple of years ago. And within our expense ratio, the distribution cost component of our expense ratio has continued to come down while we have been able to do that. So I am really optimistic that as we move forward and look to grow in more states that our Allstate agency force is going to be a core part of that and we will continue to be able to do that, but do that at a lower distribution cost overall. On the operating cost side through the combination of becoming more digital, outsourcing, offshoring, just improving processes, we have seen pretty significant reduction in operating costs going forward and we are going to continue to hammer on that one. We have also seen similar improvements on the claim side. Although I will say we are going to continue to invest in claims as part of profit improvement plan to get more effective on a number of processes. And I think the combination of the efficiencies we will get in those three areas will help fund the marketing investments that we want to make and will make as we look to accelerate growth.\nGregory Peters: Okay.\nTom Wilson: But if we need to spend money to grow on advertising and we like the profitability, we are going to spend more money on advertising.\nGregory Peters: That makes sense. Can you just help remind me how the transformative growth plan moves over and touches National General or is National General sort of in its own ecosystem in terms of how you are thinking about expenses?\nMario Rizzo: No. National General is a core part of transformative growth. The reason we acquired National General was to, first and foremost improve our competitive positioning in the independent agent channel and we have done that. With the business, we got a very well run non-standard auto business that we have continued to grow and grow profitably over the last several years. We are in the, I will say, early stages of rolling out what we call Custom 360. As I mentioned, that\u2019s the standard and preferred auto and homeowners offering. So we think there\u2019s significant opportunity in the independent agent space. When you look at the size of the National General business when we bought it compared to what it is now, our total IA presence, say, at the beginning of 2021 was a little over $5 billion, which included National General plus the Allstate independent agent business, as well as the encompass business. It\u2019s over $9 billion currently. So we have had a lot of success in that channel and we think there\u2019s just a ton of opportunity both in non-standard auto, but in standard preferred homeowners in the IA channel, and we expect to continue to capture that opportunity and that\u2019s a core part of how we are going to grow and a core part of the transformative growth strategy.\nGregory Peters: Got it. Thank you for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. I want to stay on the line of growth, if I can. So based on the expectation that Allstate will be better competitively positioned in 2024? Like, how quickly and aggressively can you pivot a growth and is it more a matter of improving the retention rates, which I would think would be pretty quick or is it more about the ability to pivot to new business?\nTom Wilson: Well, how quickly will depend what happens in the marketplace, Yaron. So, I fully expect that Progressive and GEICO are going to spend more money in advertising and seeking to grow this year based on where their profitability is. State Farm has also been aggressive in trying to grow. Although they still have to improve their price position so that they are earning profit. But I expect it to continue to be a competitive environment. But you are right about the -- and then, it will just be how effective are we versus them. We feel -- Mario showed you the numbers, where two-thirds of the country were like all systems go. When you add in California, that\u2019s another big chunk. So we think we have got plenty of open fields, so to speak, to run in and to compete with transformative growth. We have validated a lot of the underlying assumptions, but we have yet to bring it to market in a consolidated way in particular states with all of our channels, that\u2019s on Mario\u2019s list to do this year. So we feel good about those opportunities. So we will grow as fast as we can and still make sure we have a good combined ratio. Mario, what would you add to that?\nMario Rizzo: Yeah. I think that\u2019s a comprehensive answer, Tom. And I think the short answer, Yaron, is it\u2019s going to be both through retention and new business acquisition. And certainly, as we said earlier, as more states get into the right zone from a margin perspective, we would expect the amount of rate we need to take in those states to diminish. That\u2019s really, again, as Tom said earlier, is going to be a function of what the future loss trend looks like, but having to take less rate is a good thing from a retention perspective and we will continue to focus on that. And then in terms of new business, as we begin to invest in more states and do things like unwinding some of the restrictive underwriting actions we had to take to limit growth, invest in marketing and take full advantage of the broad distribution capabilities we have built across the Allstate exclusive agency system, direct and independent agent. We think we can fully leverage all the things we have been building with a better competitive position to help drive growth. But timing will be dependent on state-by-state, market-by-market, and influenced in large part by the competitive marketplace we are going to be operating in.\nYaron Kinar: Thanks. And then maybe as my follow-up, tying the appetite to grow as much as you can profitably to the question of capital. You talked in the past and even on this call, about the -- about maybe selling the Health and Benefits business, you talked about the stop loss that you were looking to maybe purchase last year. Do you need to take any of these actions or other strategic actions in order to satisfy the growth appetite or do you have all the capital you need to grow as much as you want today?\nMario Rizzo: No. We don\u2019t have to take any of those actions, we have plenty of capital and we have plenty of capital today. When you look at our earnings power, we will have plenty of capital to fund whatever growth we think we can achieve.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the holdco cash. It did go up in the quarter. Did you guys take a dividend out of AIC or another entity in the third quarter.\nJesse Merten: Good morning, Elyse. It\u2019s Jess. So as it relates to holdco cash, you can see that it went up from the prior quarter and this was really in accordance with our normal practice of moving capital around to maximize flexibility. So what we did do is move some capital up from a statutory legal entity was not AIC. But we moved some money out from statutory legal entities, as well as a few dividends out of non-insurance companies into the holding company. I know when we have talked in prior quarters, we had a few insurance companies that had fair amount of capital in them and didn\u2019t have risk, because the risk was all reinsured into the Allstate Insurance Company, so sort of in the normal-course of creating flexibility, we looked at those entities and move some of that surplus up to the holdco in the quarter.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question is on policy growth, but on the Nat Gen side, right? You guys have been showing on as growth slow within Allstate brand. You have been showing pretty strong growth within Nat Gen policies in-force. Just hoping to get some color there as you have kind of put way through books like what\u2019s been driving the growth within NAT Gen and how should we think about that continuing from here?\nMario Rizzo: Yeah. Hi, Elyse. It\u2019s Mario. So most of the growth that we have been experience in the National General has been in the non-standard auto space. And as you know, that\u2019s a part of the market that\u2019s had a lot of disruption competitively where a lot of carriers have really pulled out or certainly slowed their growth. With National General, we have taken the same approach from a profit improvement perspective as we have in Allstate, we have taken almost 23 points of rate over the last two years in National General. The non-standard auto book intends to turnover quickly, so you can reprice the book on a continual basis. And so we have stayed in that market, we generated meaningful growth in non-standard auto and we are comfortable with the margins that we are experiencing in that in that book of business and look to continue to grow that. On top of that, as I said earlier, we are rolling out the Customer 360, which is going up market. In the IA channel to write standard preferred auto and homeowners. Again, early stages there. The good news is, that product is in 16 states, we are getting good traction and it accounts for in the fourth quarter, it was about 70% of our standard auto and preferred new business production in the IA channel. We will expand that into additional states throughout the course of 2024 and into 2025. So we think that will be an additive opportunity in the IA space. But we are comfortable with what we have been writing non-standard auto and National General, we think there\u2019s an additive opportunity as we look to really leverage Allstate\u2019s capabilities in the middle-market to expand National General in that space in the IA channel.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nBob Huang: Hi. Good morning. Just a quick question on the capital side, obviously, your capital now, it seems to be very sufficient. Curious as to how you think about the path to resuming buybacks, especially given the material rebound in capital levels so far?\nTom Wilson: So -- hi. This is Tom. I am going to start. Our capital is always been sufficient. So it should like reiterate what the position we have had. As it relates to buybacks when we are looking at capital regenerate. We start with, first, making sure we have enough capital to run the business and to grow the business and we have -- had put aside more capital for growth, given the dramatic increase in premiums and the risk and we think by transformative growth. We will continue to have opportunities to deploying capital and high ROEs in fact growth. So that\u2019s the first thing we do is like how do you drive shareholder value. And so, I think, looking forward with those opportunities, we will have less capital than it\u2019s for share buybacks that we had historically. That said, we have a strong track record of buying shares back. I think, I don\u2019t know, since I have been CEO, maybe it\u2019s $30 billion worth of shares we bought back. Like, if we don\u2019t have a good use for the capital. Then we will give it back to shareholders, because there\u2019s no sense holding onto extra capital. But between growth in the Property-Liability business, growth in some of our Protection Services, they tend to be a little lighter in terms of capital needs. And then our investment portfolio we derisked our investment portfolio last year, because of what we didn\u2019t see as great market opportunities and if we saw there was opportunities to put more risk into that portfolio that would be another use of capital. So I think -- the think about capital we are always trying to manage and maximize shareholder value and we will do that -- do whatever form that is best.\nBob Huang: All right. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful and apologies for misstating the capital side of things.\nTom Wilson: Okay. That\u2019s fine. So my second question really is on the expense. So one thing we hear typically from litigation lawyers is that, well, social inflation is an issue because insurance companies, carriers tend to under underfunded claims departments and often have inexperienced claim staffing. As you think about expense save going forward and as we think about re-pivoting back to growth, can you maybe help us think about what areas within expenses are you cutting and what are the areas where it is very critical and then things that are you are not going to cut on the expense side, is it possible to provide some colors?\nTom Wilson: Let me maybe address the litigation fees. Mario, can talk about expenses in claims. And then if you want, we can go above that in claims, already share just folks on claims. I am not shocked that lawyers would say that the only reason they exist is because we don\u2019t have good people settling claims. That\u2019s just not true. We -- bodily injury claims are where our customers get into an accident and hurt somebody else, we take those very seriously. We try to resolve those quickly. We try to make sure people get a fair amount. So I don\u2019t think I have seen any systemic changes either in the way we do it or the way the industry does it. I will say there have been a couple of things that have led to increased number of suits and litigation. First is, there\u2019s just more severe accidents. So during the pandemic, people started driving faster. They keep driving faster. And so when you look at the severity of the accidents, severity is up, and when severity is up, people tend to get hurt more, and when people get hurt more, they tend to have more damages, and that leads to a greater increase in the use of lawyers to help them resolve their claims. So that part seems completely natural to me. There\u2019s, obviously, been a big change in the way those litigation firms go to market. I don\u2019t know, obviously, but if you look at their advertising spend today, it\u2019s over $1 billion a year. So they are out looking for customers. Some of those are people who need their help because they have been in severe accidents and there are more of them. Some of them are people that maybe don\u2019t need as much help. They have also gotten much more sophisticated in the use of data and analytics, and trying to hunt down claimants and possible clients. Some of that would be good. Some of that -- we are not so sure they are actually doing what they are supposed to be doing. So I think it\u2019s just a process, like, we want to make sure people get the right amount, we don\u2019t want them to get too little and we don\u2019t want them to get too much, we work to do that. You saw, we mentioned in the release for sure that we have also been settling claims faster. I guess we mentioned it in a presentation as well. So to counter that, what we have found is that if we can put more resources on a claim, settle it faster, then people are less likely to feel they need to go get a lawyer. They are happy, we are happy and it\u2019s cheaper for everybody because nobody has to pay the 30% to attorneys. Mario, do you want to talk more about claims, maybe bodily injury, other claim expenses?\nMario Rizzo: Yeah. I guess where I start is, as we talked over the last really couple of years about our profit improvement plan, it\u2019s multidimensional, and one dimension that we have continued to focus on is just improving claim operational execution. The fact is, as much as continuing to reduce our cost structure improves our competitive position, really operational excellence and claims is another way to make sure that, we pay what we owe, but that also will translate into better competitive position over time. So we are focused on really, I would say, all elements of the claim process. It\u2019s people, it\u2019s process, it\u2019s technology, analytics. And we are going to invest in the claims process moving forward across all those dimensions to just continue to invest in terms of people, making sure we have the right adjuster capacity. We went through a pretty significant turnover. It was really in 2022. That has largely subsided. So we have much more stability in terms of claim staffing, but we are focused on training claim staff and providing them the tools, both in bodily injury and in physical damage to operate in a way that, again, we pay what we owe, but we ensure that we eliminate any leakage in the system and again, that\u2019s been a core part of the profit improvement plan going forward. We are investing in people to provide more oversight, get more eyes on cars in the physical damage side, do a much more effective job in terms of total loss evaluation on the injury side. Tom mentioned we are paying claims faster. We have reduced our pending inventory on the casualty side to the lowest level it\u2019s been since well before the pandemic. We think that continues to reduce reserve risk going forward. So I would say, really, the answer is, we are going to continue to invest in claims broadly, because we just do believe it\u2019s a core part of enabling us to be more competitive and ultimately translate into growth.\nTom Wilson: Let me link this to Greg\u2019s question as well, because I think sometimes when we set goals out there and we talk about specific line items in the P&L, we don\u2019t always show the subtleties of how they are linked together. So we clearly have a goal to reduce expenses related to transformative growth so we can be a low cost provider. That said, we -- that\u2019s not our primary goal. Our primary goal is to treat our customers really well, to build a great long-term business platform and to settle our claims and run our business properly. So if it means we have to spend more money on claims personnel, so that we lower, so loss costs come down and we think that\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders and our customers, then we are going to do that even if the expense number goes up. So we put those numbers out there to help you say we are let you know we are managing them, but we are not captured by just that one-line item.\nBob Huang: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question please.\nJosh Shanker: Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Once upon a time you think about combined ratio guidance and now you talk more about ROE guidance, which is sensible. But I look at the results in homeowners and they are quite volatile and good this quarter. I want to know where we stand in terms of pricing adequacy broadly for the homeowners\u2019 line. But more importantly, I want to see pricing adequacy for bundlers, I assume that you have a pricing adequacy for monoline drivers and it\u2019s different for the bundlers. Are we at a point where you are very happy to take unbundles at a nice level of profitability today?\nTom Wilson: I will let Mario take on the bundling question, because we are really happy about that. Let me just -- in terms of the homeowners\u2019 business, we really like the business. It\u2019s -- you see -- look at our six-year combined ratio before this year, it was 92 and so really high return on equity, it\u2019s a great combined ratio. If you look at our underlying combined ratio this year, which excludes catastrophes, it\u2019s come down from last year. Obviously, we had a bad two quarters -- bad two quarters doesn\u2019t make a bad business. So we still really like the business, we have raised prices in the low-teens this year from a variety of different ways. So we like that business. If cats is the first two quarters are indicative of where we go in the future, our cats were up $2.5 billion this year versus the prior year. So if that\u2019s the case. I am confident we have the business model, which will adapt to it. We might not catch it before it, you won\u2019t catch it before it happens, but we haven\u2019t really great go-to-market business, so we are really happy with the homeowners\u2019 business. Mario, do you want to talk about returns in the homeowners\u2019 business and then the bundling question.\nMario Rizzo: Yes. So, Josh. On -- in terms of overall rate adequacy. Obviously, through the combination of the rates we have taken over the last couple of years, plus the inflation and replacement values in homes, that\u2019s really fueling a pretty consistent and significant low-teens increase in average premiums. So this quarter that was about 12.5%, so we are seeing price flow through the system. And that doesn\u2019t include, because as you know, with a 12-month policy, it takes 24 months to earn it all that rate. So a lot of the rate we took in 2023 we have yet to earn and we are going to we are going to keep at it in terms of staying on top of loss cost. The underlying combined ratio for the year was 67 improved by about 3 points, mid 60s is where we would like that number to be. So we are getting closer to that, we have more rate that\u2019s going to earn in, and as Tom mentioned, we feel really good about our capabilities in homeowners and we are going to continue to lean-in and look to grow that business. From a bundling perspective, just 80% of our homeowners\u2019 customers have a supporting line are bundled. That\u2019s a pretty meaningful number and it happens at discount, it\u2019s upwards of 15%. And again, what we think with that pricing the lifetime value of that bundled segment is substantial and we will write bundled customers all day long. Our agents are writing bundled business at an all-time high level north of 70% of new business we are incenting agents to write that, we are seeing more bundled business come through our call centers and our direct business. And as I talked earlier Custom 360 going up market is both in auto and home offering. So we think we are well-positioned across all three channels to continue to attract bundled business that we can be even more competitively priced and because of the discounting element, but also it\u2019s a segment that we think generates substantial lifetime value and we are good at it, so we are going to keep that.\nTom Wilson: Hey, Josh. I know you are a student of our competitors. So you see both GEICO and Progressive talking more about bundling in their advertising. They obviously see also good customers there. Our difference is we expect to make money in homeowners.\nJosh Shanker: And if I just close upon that, even though we are going to see some modest decline in auto policy count due to price increases and turning the book a little bit, are you net growing bundlers every day?\nTom Wilson: I think we probably don\u2019t give that number out, but let\u2019s just say, we have a high focus on bundling, our agents are doing more bundling these days because we changed the way in which we reward and compensate them. So we are continuing to hunt down.\nBrent Vandermause: I think we have time for one more question, is that.\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our final question then. And our final question for today comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. Your question please.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey. Thanks for sweeping me in at the end. Quick -- maybe some quick questions here. With regard to the impacts of unwinding the restrictions and increasing advertising, could you give us a sense of the impacts of each on the combined ratio?\nTom Wilson: Well, I think, the first -- the principal impact of unwinding underwriting restrictions will be to kind of increase the aperture of the types of risks that we will be willing to write. Again, now that in the states that we are going to do that, we feel better and good about our rate adequacy and that\u2019s true across segments. So we have a pretty sophisticated approach to pricing where the prices accurately reflect the specific risks of each individual segment. So as we write more business, it\u2019s going to be written at what we believe to be a rate adequate level. Now, from a new business perspective, as we increase the volume of new business, that does tend to write or run a higher loss ratio due to renewal relativity going forward. So it will have some impact on our overall combined ratio going forward. But we take that into account in terms of how we manage the business. But we don\u2019t open the underwriting restrictions until we are comfortable with the rate level we are at. We price each risk according to its unique characteristics. Having said that, there is a new business penalty associated with higher new business volume. But again, we factor that in in terms of how we manage the overall combined ratio in the business.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. And then with regard to severity, just to make sure I am clear on it, you talked about 8% to 9% in 2023. Is that what you are anticipating for 2024 and how are you thinking about frequency as well going into the year?\nMario Rizzo: We don\u2019t do a forecast for either frequency or severity on a go-forward basis. I would say it\u2019s whatever it is, we will make sure we get priced for it.\nAndrew Kligerman: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Wilson: Okay. Thank you all for spending time with us this quarter. Obviously, with the sun shining a little bit and a few less cats, it gave you the opportunity to see the benefits of all the hard work the team\u2019s been doing to improve profitability in auto insurance and making sure we keep our homeowner business strong. We didn\u2019t really get to our other businesses, but they also continue to do quite well and our investment portfolio and team had a great year when you look at our total returns. So we feel good about where we are going forward. Thank you and we will see you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Jesse Merten",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Mario. On slide 11 we delve deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. As shown in the chart on the left, the Property-Liability underwriting expense ratio decreased two points from 2022 to 2023 as we continue to focus on lowering costs to provide more value to customers and some of the benefits of higher earned premium growth relative to fixed costs. The right half of the chart provides additional context on the drivers of the 1.3-point improvement in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first red bar shows the two-tenth of a point impact from increased advertising spend, reflecting the slight increase was driven by seasonal investment changes and growth investments in rate adequacy states. The second green bar shows the 1.4 -- 1.4-point decline in operating costs, which was mainly driven by lower employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums relative to fixed costs in the quarter. Shifting to the longer term trend in the chart on the right, we remain committed to reducing the adjusted expense ratio as part of transformative growth. As a reminder, the adjusted expense ratio starts with our underwriting expense ratio, which I just covered and excludes restructuring COVID-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising expense. It then adds our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims. Those expenses are excluded because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate. Through innovation, process improvement and strong execution, we have driven significant improvement in expenses for the fourth quarter and year-end 2023 adjusted expense ratio of 24.7. This reflects decreases in both the underwriting expense and non-cat claims expense ratio compared to the prior year quarter. Now moving to slide 12, I will cover investment results. This quarter showed how our proactive approach to duration management benefits results. The chart on the left shows changes we made in the duration of the bond portfolio in comparison to bond market yields, from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, lowering fixed-income duration, mitigated losses as rates rose. Beginning in Q4 of 2022, we began to extend duration which when combined with higher yields has increased market-based income. Our fixed income yield, shown in the table below the chart, remains below the current intermediate corporate bond yield, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields as we continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows into higher interest rates. The bar chart on the right shows the income and total return benefits of these decisions. As you can see in the table on the chart, the total return of our portfolio was 4.6% in the fourth quarter and 6.7% for the year. Portfolio returns in both periods reflect income earned, as well as higher fixed income valuations due to the decline in market yields in the fourth quarter. Net investment income totaled $604 million in the quarter, which was $47 million above the fourth quarter of last year. Market based income of $604 million shown in blue, was $140 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting the repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration and the benefit from higher yielding assets that sustainably increase income. Market based income also benefit -- benefited from higher fixed-income balances. Performance based income of $60 million shown in black, was 87 million below the prior year quarter due to lower valuation increases and fewer sales of underlying assets. As we have stated previously, the performance based portfolio is expected to enhance long-term returns as demonstrated through our five-year and 10-year internal rates of return of 12% and volatility in these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected. Slide 13 covers results for our Protection Services businesses. Revenue in these businesses increased 11.8% to $719 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This result is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans, which increased 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded product breadth and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $4 million in the fourth quarter decreased $34 million as compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease is attributable to the results of a state income tax examination that increased the effective state tax rate that we apply, which increased deferred income taxes by $43 million in the quarter for future tax payments and Protection Services, largely related to dealer services. The impact of the tax change on the enterprise was a net benefit of $6 million. We do not anticipate that these tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our ongoing operations. Shifting now to slide 14, our Health and Benefits businesses continue to generate profitable growth. From the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue of $630 million increased by $50 million compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in individual health, group health, as well as fees and other revenue. Adjusted net income of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, increased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter as individual health revenue growth partially offset higher benefit ratios in group health. As you know, late last year, we announced a decision to pursue the divestiture of our Health and Benefits business following the successful integration of Allstate's voluntary benefits business in National General's Group and individual health businesses. We continue to anticipate a transaction will be completed in 2024. We will close on slide 15 by reviewing Allstate's financial condition and capital position. Allstate's proactive capital management approach provides the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to navigate a challenging operating environment, while providing support for long-term value creation. Fourth quarter results demonstrated the company's capital generation capabilities with a statutory surplus in holding company assets of $18 billion, increasing by $1.6 billion compared to the prior quarter. Assets held at the holding company also increased to $3.4 billion. The increase to the prior quarter primarily reflects a return of capital from National General statutory entities, partially offset by common shareholder dividends. Additionally, GAAP shareholders' equity of $17.8 billion increased $3.2 billion compared to the prior quarter, reflecting $1.5 billion of GAAP net income and the improved unrealized position on fixed income securities of $1.9 billion. We continue to proactively manage capital, make progress on the comprehensive profit improvement plan and invest in transformative growth. We remain confident that these strategic actions will generate attractive shareholder returns. With that as context, let's open it up for your questions. Good morning, Elyse. It's Jess. So as it relates to holdco cash, you can see that it went up from the prior quarter and this was really in accordance with our normal practice of moving capital around to maximize flexibility. So what we did do is move some capital up from a statutory legal entity was not AIC. But we moved some money out from statutory legal entities, as well as a few dividends out of non-insurance companies into the holding company. I know when we have talked in prior quarters, we had a few insurance companies that had fair amount of capital in them and didn't have risk, because the risk was all reinsured into the Allstate Insurance Company, so sort of in the normal-course of creating flexibility, we looked at those entities and move some of that surplus up to the holdco in the quarter."

            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Good morning. And we appreciate you taking the time and spending your efforts to explore why Allstate is an attractive investment. So I will begin with an overview of our strategy and results, and Mario and Jess, can go through the operating performance. Then we will have time for your questions at the end. Let's begin on slide two, which depicts Allstate's strategy to increase shareholder value. So we have two components to this strategy, increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the fourth quarter. We generated net income of $1.5 billion. The strong results reflect our actions to improve auto insurance profitability and mild weather conditions, which was a welcome reprieve from the elevated level of weather related losses in the first three quarters of the year. The proactive approach to increasing bond duration also contributed to strong results with higher income from the market based portfolio. To further increase shareholder value this year, we remain focused on improving auto insurance profitability. There is more work to be done, but we are well on our way. Additional shareholder value will then be increased by increasing policies in-force across all of our businesses. The transformative growth initiatives to drive Property-Liability market share growth can be implemented in more states this year now as auto margins have been improved. We are also focusing on expanding protection offerings to Protection Services businesses, which is shown in the lower oval as Protection Plans, Identity Protection, Roadside and Arity, all have good growth prospects. As you know, we started the process to sell the Health and Benefits business and that process is proceeding on schedule. Let's review the financial results on slide three. Revenues of $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter increased by 8.7%. That reflects a 10.7% increase in Property-Liability earned premium and that was due to rate increases in 2022 and -- mostly in 2022, and in 2023 in both the auto and homeowners' insurances. Net investment income in the quarter was $604 million, an 8.4% increase, reflecting higher fixed-income yields and duration extension, which is partially offset by lower performance based income. The strong profitability in the quarter generated adjusted net income of $1.5 billion or $5.82 per diluted share. Annual revenues of $57 billion were up $5.7 billion or 11.1% over the prior year. Strong fourth quarter earnings resulted in positive adjusted net income for the year. Slide four summarizes the status of the four-part auto insurance profit improvement plan. Strong execution resulted in 6.7% point improvement in the combined ratio in 2023. Starting with rates. Since 2022, the Allstate brand implemented rate increases 33.3%, which included 16.4% in 2023 and 6.9% in the fourth quarter, driven by the recent approvals in California, New York and New Jersey. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022 and an additional 12.8% in 2023. Looking forward, we will pursue rate increases in 10 states to improve margins and in other states to keep pace with increases in loss costs. Expense reductions were initiated in 2019 as part of the transformative growth plan to become a low cost provider of protections, being early in this effort helped offset the rapid inflation in loss costs. The underwriting expense ratio decreased 1.1 points in 2023 compared to the prior year when you exclude the large decline in advertising that was directly linked to lower profitability. Looking forward, further cost reductions will improve efficiencies and our competitive price position. Given the significant improvement in perspective, auto margins will increase advertising investment this year. In addition, we implemented underwriting actions to restrict new business, where we were not achieving target returns. We are moving some underwriting restrictions as rate adequacy is achieved. Finally, enhancing claim practices in a high inflation and increasingly litigious environment are required to deliver good customer value. This includes accelerating the settlement of injury claims and increasing in-person inspections. This program has positioned us to increase new business levels and begin to grow policies in-force in sales where acceptable margins have been restored. Now I will turn it over to Mario to discuss Property-Liability. Thank you, Jimmy. I will let, Mario, really three different stories, Mario will take you through those in, then we will do a follow-up question, and I would just remind everybody, we like -- ask one question with a follow-up, hopefully, related to the first question. But so we can make sure we get through everybody's call. So, Mario, you... Jimmy, this is Tom. I will start and then Mario can give -- can add on to that. I would say that the current competitive environment is still in flux. So, we raise our rates 30 points in California. State Farm gets another increase somewhere after that. So it's too early to tell what impact that will have on volume in 2024. We do -- our goal, though, is obviously to, one, make good money for our shareholders as first part, and as Jess said, the other part is, we need to grow. So we are -- we think we have got transformative growth in place, which is differentiated in a long-term growth plan, as well as some of the short-term things you are talking about here. Mario, what would you add to that? Greg, I will start and Mario can jump in. So I don't know that, I think, there is counterintuitive that as you grow your expenses can't go down, and I would point out, if you look at National General, its growth has helped drive more scale and has brought its expenses down. So that's just a scale-related comment to it. As you relate -- you look at the programs we have in place on transformative growth, it's really across the Board. Everywhere we are at where programs that are -- we have been working on for three plus years and they are rolling out as we go. For example, we are cutting costs by becoming more digital. By becoming more digital, we can move more jobs either get rid of the jobs or move them offshore. That's a multiyear thing. You don't just take first notice of loss and change it in three months. So the benefits of those programs, which we have been working and rolling those out for the last 18 months really still will get more of those benefits as we go forward in 2024 just based on the work we have already done. In terms of agent commission, Mario mentioned this, we have changed the agent commission structure such that it pays more for new business and less for renewals and that was one of the core parts of transformative growth was how do we distribute our products at a lower price and still give people the value of an agent. And people want an agent to buy the stuff, they don't necessarily want to pay as much for attention. One of the underlying assumptions we validated with transformer growth, which quite honestly, a number of analysts and other people were not so sure, but you are going to keep agents head in the game? And the answer is, yes. Look at the productivity numbers that Mario showed. Do they like having renewal compensation go down? No. Do our customers like having a better priced product? Yes. And so we choose to do what our customers want and they have worked through that. So we have a series of things that go on. Now, we do spend money, but like -- we are doing our expenses to, first, take care of our customers, second, build long-term value. We are not running our expenses to make a particular P&L number in a quarter. We just don't do that. We cut advertising, as you pointed out, because there was no sense growing if you are losing money on the product. It wasn't because we were trying to make some combined ratio target. It certainly helped that. But we are like, why go out and advertise if you are going to write it at 105 combined ratio. So we think about it economically first and in terms of creating long-term value. Mario, do you want to talk about how you are thinking about expenses and where you go this year? But if we need to spend money to grow on advertising and we like the profitability, we are going to spend more money on advertising. Well, how quickly will depend what happens in the marketplace, Yaron. So, I fully expect that Progressive and GEICO are going to spend more money in advertising and seeking to grow this year based on where their profitability is. State Farm has also been aggressive in trying to grow. Although they still have to improve their price position so that they are earning profit. But I expect it to continue to be a competitive environment. But you are right about the -- and then, it will just be how effective are we versus them. We feel -- Mario showed you the numbers, where two-thirds of the country were like all systems go. When you add in California, that's another big chunk. So we think we have got plenty of open fields, so to speak, to run in and to compete with transformative growth. We have validated a lot of the underlying assumptions, but we have yet to bring it to market in a consolidated way in particular states with all of our channels, that's on Mario's list to do this year. So we feel good about those opportunities. So we will grow as fast as we can and still make sure we have a good combined ratio. Mario, what would you add to that? So -- hi. This is Tom. I am going to start. Our capital is always been sufficient. So it should like reiterate what the position we have had. As it relates to buybacks when we are looking at capital regenerate. We start with, first, making sure we have enough capital to run the business and to grow the business and we have -- had put aside more capital for growth, given the dramatic increase in premiums and the risk and we think by transformative growth. We will continue to have opportunities to deploying capital and high ROEs in fact growth. So that's the first thing we do is like how do you drive shareholder value. And so, I think, looking forward with those opportunities, we will have less capital than it's for share buybacks that we had historically. That said, we have a strong track record of buying shares back. I think, I don't know, since I have been CEO, maybe it's $30 billion worth of shares we bought back. Like, if we don't have a good use for the capital. Then we will give it back to shareholders, because there's no sense holding onto extra capital. But between growth in the Property-Liability business, growth in some of our Protection Services, they tend to be a little lighter in terms of capital needs. And then our investment portfolio we derisked our investment portfolio last year, because of what we didn't see as great market opportunities and if we saw there was opportunities to put more risk into that portfolio that would be another use of capital. So I think -- the think about capital we are always trying to manage and maximize shareholder value and we will do that -- do whatever form that is best. Okay. That's fine. So my second question really is on the expense. So one thing we hear typically from litigation lawyers is that, well, social inflation is an issue because insurance companies, carriers tend to under underfunded claims departments and often have inexperienced claim staffing. As you think about expense save going forward and as we think about re-pivoting back to growth, can you maybe help us think about what areas within expenses are you cutting and what are the areas where it is very critical and then things that are you are not going to cut on the expense side, is it possible to provide some colors? Let me maybe address the litigation fees. Mario, can talk about expenses in claims. And then if you want, we can go above that in claims, already share just folks on claims. I am not shocked that lawyers would say that the only reason they exist is because we don't have good people settling claims. That's just not true. We -- bodily injury claims are where our customers get into an accident and hurt somebody else, we take those very seriously. We try to resolve those quickly. We try to make sure people get a fair amount. So I don't think I have seen any systemic changes either in the way we do it or the way the industry does it. I will say there have been a couple of things that have led to increased number of suits and litigation. First is, there's just more severe accidents. So during the pandemic, people started driving faster. They keep driving faster. And so when you look at the severity of the accidents, severity is up, and when severity is up, people tend to get hurt more, and when people get hurt more, they tend to have more damages, and that leads to a greater increase in the use of lawyers to help them resolve their claims. So that part seems completely natural to me. There's, obviously, been a big change in the way those litigation firms go to market. I don't know, obviously, but if you look at their advertising spend today, it's over $1 billion a year. So they are out looking for customers. Some of those are people who need their help because they have been in severe accidents and there are more of them. Some of them are people that maybe don't need as much help. They have also gotten much more sophisticated in the use of data and analytics, and trying to hunt down claimants and possible clients. Some of that would be good. Some of that -- we are not so sure they are actually doing what they are supposed to be doing. So I think it's just a process, like, we want to make sure people get the right amount, we don't want them to get too little and we don't want them to get too much, we work to do that. You saw, we mentioned in the release for sure that we have also been settling claims faster. I guess we mentioned it in a presentation as well. So to counter that, what we have found is that if we can put more resources on a claim, settle it faster, then people are less likely to feel they need to go get a lawyer. They are happy, we are happy and it's cheaper for everybody because nobody has to pay the 30% to attorneys. Mario, do you want to talk more about claims, maybe bodily injury, other claim expenses? Let me link this to Greg's question as well, because I think sometimes when we set goals out there and we talk about specific line items in the P&L, we don't always show the subtleties of how they are linked together. So we clearly have a goal to reduce expenses related to transformative growth so we can be a low cost provider. That said, we -- that's not our primary goal. Our primary goal is to treat our customers really well, to build a great long-term business platform and to settle our claims and run our business properly. So if it means we have to spend more money on claims personnel, so that we lower, so loss costs come down and we think that's in the best interest of our shareholders and our customers, then we are going to do that even if the expense number goes up. So we put those numbers out there to help you say we are let you know we are managing them, but we are not captured by just that one-line item. I will let Mario take on the bundling question, because we are really happy about that. Let me just -- in terms of the homeowners' business, we really like the business. It's -- you see -- look at our six-year combined ratio before this year, it was 92 and so really high return on equity, it's a great combined ratio. If you look at our underlying combined ratio this year, which excludes catastrophes, it's come down from last year. Obviously, we had a bad two quarters -- bad two quarters doesn't make a bad business. So we still really like the business, we have raised prices in the low-teens this year from a variety of different ways. So we like that business. If cats is the first two quarters are indicative of where we go in the future, our cats were up $2.5 billion this year versus the prior year. So if that's the case. I am confident we have the business model, which will adapt to it. We might not catch it before it, you won't catch it before it happens, but we haven't really great go-to-market business, so we are really happy with the homeowners' business. Mario, do you want to talk about returns in the homeowners' business and then the bundling question. Hey, Josh. I know you are a student of our competitors. So you see both GEICO and Progressive talking more about bundling in their advertising. They obviously see also good customers there. Our difference is we expect to make money in homeowners. I think we probably don't give that number out, but let's just say, we have a high focus on bundling, our agents are doing more bundling these days because we changed the way in which we reward and compensate them. So we are continuing to hunt down. Well, I think, the first -- the principal impact of unwinding underwriting restrictions will be to kind of increase the aperture of the types of risks that we will be willing to write. Again, now that in the states that we are going to do that, we feel better and good about our rate adequacy and that's true across segments. So we have a pretty sophisticated approach to pricing where the prices accurately reflect the specific risks of each individual segment. So as we write more business, it's going to be written at what we believe to be a rate adequate level. Now, from a new business perspective, as we increase the volume of new business, that does tend to write or run a higher loss ratio due to renewal relativity going forward. So it will have some impact on our overall combined ratio going forward. But we take that into account in terms of how we manage the business. But we don't open the underwriting restrictions until we are comfortable with the rate level we are at. We price each risk according to its unique characteristics. Having said that, there is a new business penalty associated with higher new business volume. But again, we factor that in in terms of how we manage the overall combined ratio in the business. Okay. Thank you all for spending time with us this quarter. Obviously, with the sun shining a little bit and a few less cats, it gave you the opportunity to see the benefits of all the hard work the team's been doing to improve profitability in auto insurance and making sure we keep our homeowner business strong. We didn't really get to our other businesses, but they also continue to do quite well and our investment portfolio and team had a great year when you look at our total returns. So we feel good about where we are going forward. Thank you and we will see you next quarter."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's start on slide five. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by, excuse me, higher average premiums from rate increases, partially offset by a 2% decline in policies in-force. Underwriting income of $1.3 billion in the quarter improved $2.4 billion compared to the prior year quarter due to increased premiums earned, improved underlying loss experience, lower catastrophe losses and operating efficiencies. The chart on the right highlights the components of the 89.5 combined ratio in the quarter, which improved 19.6 points from the prior year quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve re-estimates on the combined ratio as shown in light blue and gray materially improved compared to the prior year. Catastrophe losses of $68 million were $711 million or 6.3 points lower than prior year due to the mild weather conditions experienced in the quarter and favorable loss development from prior period events. Prior year reserve re-estimates, excluding catastrophes, were unfavorable and totaled $199 million, representing a 1.6-point adverse combined ratio impact in the quarter and a 0.9-point favorable impact compared to the prior year quarter. Approximately $148 million related to personal auto driven in part by costs related to claims in litigation and adverse development in National General. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9, improved by 12.3 points compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher average premium and the favorable influence of milder weather conditions on accident frequency. Despite the favorable results in the quarter, the full year combined ratio of 104.5 was significantly impacted by elevated catastrophe losses primarily from events in the first three quarters, resulting in a catastrophe loss ratio that was 4 points above the 10-year average from 2013 to 2022. Now let's move to slide six to review Allstate's auto insurance profit trends. The fourth quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 98.9 improved by 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earned premium, lower underlying losses, lower adverse prior year reserve re-estimates and expense efficiencies. The chart shows the underlying combined ratios from 2022 and 2023 with quarterly reported figures adjusted to reflect the estimated average severity level as of year-end for each year. As you can see, the underlying combined ratio decreased each quarter in 2023, reflecting the benefits of the profit improvement plan, Tom discussed earlier. As a reminder, we continually reassess claim severity expectations as the year progresses. If the current year expected severity increases or decreases, the year-to-date impact of that change is recorded in the current quarter, despite a portion of that impact being driven by reassessment of the prior quarters. In 2023, the full year estimate of claim severity decreased in the fourth quarter. So there was a benefit from prior quarters included in reported results in the fourth quarter. When you adjust for this, the reported underlying combined ratio of 96.4, as shown in the table would be 98.2 as shown in the bar on the graph. The three preceding quarters all benefit from the adjustments, including Q3, which improved from 100.5 in the presentation shown last quarter to 99.9, reflecting the latest severity estimates. While loss cost trends remain historically elevated, the rate of increase moderated in the second half of the year, mainly in physical damage coverages. Allstate brand weighted-average major coverage severity expectations improved from 11% as of the end of the second quarter to 9% in the third quarter and now that 8% to 9% at the end of the year. As a reminder, this trend reflects our current best estimate for the year-over-year increase in average severity. Slide seven shows the impact of our profit improvement actions across the country. As shown on the left, Allstate's brand rate increases have exceeded 33% over the last eight quarters, including larger increases in California, New York, New Jersey and Texas, reflective of the elevated loss trends in these states. These four states comprised 36% of Allstate brand auto total written premiums in the U.S. during 2023. As you know, increases were approved in California, New York and New Jersey in December. So we have yet to see this in earned premiums. The chart on the right shows states with an underlying combined ratio below 100, shown in the light and dark blue bars were 65% of the total in 2023, more than doubling from the percentage at year-end 2022. Excluding California, New York, and New Jersey, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 in 2023. Slide eight shows improving profitability had a negative impact on policies in-force during 2023. On the left, you can see that total Protection Auto policies in-force, decreased by 2.9% compared to prior year, as the Allstate brand decline of 6.2% more than offset a 13.3% increase at National General. Allstate brand auto policies in-force decreased due to reduced new business volumes and lower retention. National General growth of 581,000 policies in-force was mostly driven by non-standard auto insurance and to a lesser extent, the rollout of new middle-market standard and preferred auto insurance product launches for the Custom 360 products. The chart on the right shows total personal auto new issued applications for 2023 decreased 6% compared to the prior year and the accompanying drivers. Targeted profitability actions within the Allstate brand resulted in a decline in new auto issued applications of 20% compared to the prior year. The first two red bars reflect the impact of lower new business volume in California, New York and New Jersey, as well as the direct channel decline in the remainder of the country, which was most directly impacted by the reduction in marketing investment last year. Outside of the three states where profit actions significantly reduced new business, Allstate exclusive agents increased production by 6%, driven by higher productivity, showing the response of Allstate agents to the changes we have made to incent growth and the opportunity to continue to grow with our agency owners as part of transformative growth. The acquisition of National General strategically positioned Allstate to grow in the independent agent channel with new business applications, increasing 12% in 2023. National General continues to grow non-standard auto and generate higher volume from the Custom 360 product launches. Slide nine covers homeowners' insurance results, which generated significant profits for the quarter, while full year results were impacted by elevated catastrophe losses in the first three quarters of the year. On the left you can see net written premium increased 13.3% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the National General and Allstate Brands, and a 1.1% increase in policies in-force. National General net written premium grew 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to policy in-force growth, driven by the Custom 360 offering and higher average premiums from implemented rate increases. Allstate brand net written premiums increased 12.5%, driven by average gross written premium per policy increases of 12.2% compared to the prior year quarter and a small increase in policies in-force. Allstate agents continue to bundle auto and homeowners' insurance at historically high levels. Catastrophe losses of $21 million in the fourth quarter were low by historical standards, reflecting milder weather conditions and favorable development from prior events contributing to a 62 combined ratio and $1.2 billion of underwriting income for the quarter. Milder weather in the fourth quarter also favorably influenced the underlying combined ratio due to lower non-catastrophe claim frequency. For the full year, higher catastrophe losses drove the combined ratio increase in 2023 compared to 2022. Full year catastrophe losses of $4.5 billion were higher than our historical experience and translated to a catastrophe loss ratio that was 17 points higher than prior year and roughly 14 points above the 10-year average from 2013 to 2022. As you can see from the chart on the right, the full year underlying combined ratio declined from 70.3 in 2022 to 67.3 in 2023, reflecting higher average premiums from rate increases, partially offset by higher claims severity due to materials and labor costs. With an industry-leading product, advanced pricing, underwriting and analytics, broad distribution capabilities and a comprehensive reinsurance program, we will continue to leverage homeowners as a growth opportunity and remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in this line. Moving to slide 10, let's discuss how we are advancing transformative growth to provide customers low-cost protection through broad distribution. We remain focused on four key elements of this multiyear initiative, as you can see on this slide. We have improved our cost structure to enhance our competitive price position. In the current environment with most competitors taking large rate increases, it's difficult to pinpoint competitive position. That said, our relative competitive position likely deteriorated in 2023. But as many of our competitors continue to implement rate increases and our expenses decline, we believe our competitive position will improve enhancing growth opportunities as part of transformative growth. Redesigned, affordable, simple and connected products currently available for auto insurance in seven states with plans for further expansion this year, both improve customer value and deliver a differentiated customer experience. National General independent agent growth prospects will be further enhanced by expanding Custom 360 products, which were live in 16 states as of year-end 2023 and expect to be in nearly every state by the end of 2024. Expanding customer access will also support market share growth and we have made good progress in all three channels. Increasing sophistication and customer acquisition continues to advance and will improve the effectiveness of increased advertising spend in 2024, as we look to grow in more states. A new technology ecosystem is also being deployed to improve the customer experience, speed-to-market and reduce costs for legacy technology platforms. Let me turn it over to Jess now to talk about expense reductions and other operating results. Yeah. So, Jimmy, first thing I'd say is, we have talked a lot last quarter about the actions we needed to take in the three states, California, New York and New Jersey. I will start with a view that says, look our objective is to meet the protection needs of as many customers in as many states as possible. When that can happen, we think customers are served well, markets operate effectively and we can operate our business to achieve the appropriate levels of returns. We had rate pending in all three of those states and I will just spend a minute kind of giving you the story in each one of those, because I think it's slightly different. In California, you will remember we filed a 35% rate. We got approval for 30 %. But we got approval earlier than our expected effective date. So, effectively, we filed our full rate need and got approval for our full rate need. As of yesterday, we are writing business in California, again across all channels and we feel comfortable writing business in California given the rate level that we are operating. Now, of course, having said that, we have got to stay on top of loss trends going forward and we will do that, but we are comfortable with the rate level, we have gotten California that have opened up that market. In New Jersey, it's kind of the opposite story we filed for 29 points of rate, we got approval for just under 17%. And as a result of that, we are going to continue to take the more restrictive underwriting actions that we have been taking in New Jersey, which means we will continue to get smaller in New Jersey, while we plan on filing additional rate as a matter of fact, we have two rates pending with the New Jersey Department and depending on how those things shake out that that will inform future actions we take in New Jersey. But as of right now, we will continue to get smaller in New Jersey, just given the lack of rate adequacy. And New York is kind of somewhere in between, we got approval for a 14.6% rate in December. We have implemented that, that helps. But we still need more rate. We are actively engaged with the department and intend to file our full rate need going forward and do that in reasonably short order. And again, depending on how that plays out, that will inform the next set of actions we have taken in New York. Yeah. I think, specifically, on retention, Jimmy, as Tom mentioned, in the three states we talked about, those markets are still in a bit of a state of flux. One state I'd point to, to kind of tell the story about retention and how taking outsized rates and then kind of lapping that impacts retention is Texas. We took significant rates in Texas in 2022 and earlier in 2023 and we showed you last quarter there was a pretty substantial hit to retention in Texas. As we have lapped those rates, we have seen a nice bounce back which contributed to the sequential improvement in the fourth quarter retention level in auto relative to Q3. So, once the rate need stabilizes, that certainly has a positive impact on retention going forward. And hopefully, as we in more and more states are really just keeping on top of loss trend, we would expect the headwind that we faced in retention to diminish going forward. Yeah. So, Greg, I think, when you combine the pieces that Tom talked about, I think, you can get comfortable that we can continue to improve our expense ratio and our cost structure to get more competitively priced and invest in marketing at the same time. So when I think about the broad areas where we are looking to get more efficient and where we have gotten more efficient over the last several years, first, distribution costs. So when you look at the progress we have made on creating a lower cost but more productive Allstate agency distribution system. We are really happy with the progress we have made there. And I have talked a little bit earlier about the increases in overall production. But underneath that, the even more significant increases in average productivity as we have fewer agents producing more volume today than was the case a couple of years ago. And within our expense ratio, the distribution cost component of our expense ratio has continued to come down while we have been able to do that. So I am really optimistic that as we move forward and look to grow in more states that our Allstate agency force is going to be a core part of that and we will continue to be able to do that, but do that at a lower distribution cost overall. On the operating cost side through the combination of becoming more digital, outsourcing, offshoring, just improving processes, we have seen pretty significant reduction in operating costs going forward and we are going to continue to hammer on that one. We have also seen similar improvements on the claim side. Although I will say we are going to continue to invest in claims as part of profit improvement plan to get more effective on a number of processes. And I think the combination of the efficiencies we will get in those three areas will help fund the marketing investments that we want to make and will make as we look to accelerate growth. No. National General is a core part of transformative growth. The reason we acquired National General was to, first and foremost improve our competitive positioning in the independent agent channel and we have done that. With the business, we got a very well run non-standard auto business that we have continued to grow and grow profitably over the last several years. We are in the, I will say, early stages of rolling out what we call Custom 360. As I mentioned, that's the standard and preferred auto and homeowners offering. So we think there's significant opportunity in the independent agent space. When you look at the size of the National General business when we bought it compared to what it is now, our total IA presence, say, at the beginning of 2021 was a little over $5 billion, which included National General plus the Allstate independent agent business, as well as the encompass business. It's over $9 billion currently. So we have had a lot of success in that channel and we think there's just a ton of opportunity both in non-standard auto, but in standard preferred homeowners in the IA channel, and we expect to continue to capture that opportunity and that's a core part of how we are going to grow and a core part of the transformative growth strategy. Yeah. I think that's a comprehensive answer, Tom. And I think the short answer, Yaron, is it's going to be both through retention and new business acquisition. And certainly, as we said earlier, as more states get into the right zone from a margin perspective, we would expect the amount of rate we need to take in those states to diminish. That's really, again, as Tom said earlier, is going to be a function of what the future loss trend looks like, but having to take less rate is a good thing from a retention perspective and we will continue to focus on that. And then in terms of new business, as we begin to invest in more states and do things like unwinding some of the restrictive underwriting actions we had to take to limit growth, invest in marketing and take full advantage of the broad distribution capabilities we have built across the Allstate exclusive agency system, direct and independent agent. We think we can fully leverage all the things we have been building with a better competitive position to help drive growth. But timing will be dependent on state-by-state, market-by-market, and influenced in large part by the competitive marketplace we are going to be operating in. No. We don't have to take any of those actions, we have plenty of capital and we have plenty of capital today. When you look at our earnings power, we will have plenty of capital to fund whatever growth we think we can achieve. Yeah. Hi, Elyse. It's Mario. So most of the growth that we have been experience in the National General has been in the non-standard auto space. And as you know, that's a part of the market that's had a lot of disruption competitively where a lot of carriers have really pulled out or certainly slowed their growth. With National General, we have taken the same approach from a profit improvement perspective as we have in Allstate, we have taken almost 23 points of rate over the last two years in National General. The non-standard auto book intends to turnover quickly, so you can reprice the book on a continual basis. And so we have stayed in that market, we generated meaningful growth in non-standard auto and we are comfortable with the margins that we are experiencing in that in that book of business and look to continue to grow that. On top of that, as I said earlier, we are rolling out the Customer 360, which is going up market. In the IA channel to write standard preferred auto and homeowners. Again, early stages there. The good news is, that product is in 16 states, we are getting good traction and it accounts for in the fourth quarter, it was about 70% of our standard auto and preferred new business production in the IA channel. We will expand that into additional states throughout the course of 2024 and into 2025. So we think that will be an additive opportunity in the IA space. But we are comfortable with what we have been writing non-standard auto and National General, we think there's an additive opportunity as we look to really leverage Allstate's capabilities in the middle-market to expand National General in that space in the IA channel. Yeah. I guess where I start is, as we talked over the last really couple of years about our profit improvement plan, it's multidimensional, and one dimension that we have continued to focus on is just improving claim operational execution. The fact is, as much as continuing to reduce our cost structure improves our competitive position, really operational excellence and claims is another way to make sure that, we pay what we owe, but that also will translate into better competitive position over time. So we are focused on really, I would say, all elements of the claim process. It's people, it's process, it's technology, analytics. And we are going to invest in the claims process moving forward across all those dimensions to just continue to invest in terms of people, making sure we have the right adjuster capacity. We went through a pretty significant turnover. It was really in 2022. That has largely subsided. So we have much more stability in terms of claim staffing, but we are focused on training claim staff and providing them the tools, both in bodily injury and in physical damage to operate in a way that, again, we pay what we owe, but we ensure that we eliminate any leakage in the system and again, that's been a core part of the profit improvement plan going forward. We are investing in people to provide more oversight, get more eyes on cars in the physical damage side, do a much more effective job in terms of total loss evaluation on the injury side. Tom mentioned we are paying claims faster. We have reduced our pending inventory on the casualty side to the lowest level it's been since well before the pandemic. We think that continues to reduce reserve risk going forward. So I would say, really, the answer is, we are going to continue to invest in claims broadly, because we just do believe it's a core part of enabling us to be more competitive and ultimately translate into growth. Yes. So, Josh. On -- in terms of overall rate adequacy. Obviously, through the combination of the rates we have taken over the last couple of years, plus the inflation and replacement values in homes, that's really fueling a pretty consistent and significant low-teens increase in average premiums. So this quarter that was about 12.5%, so we are seeing price flow through the system. And that doesn't include, because as you know, with a 12-month policy, it takes 24 months to earn it all that rate. So a lot of the rate we took in 2023 we have yet to earn and we are going to we are going to keep at it in terms of staying on top of loss cost. The underlying combined ratio for the year was 67 improved by about 3 points, mid 60s is where we would like that number to be. So we are getting closer to that, we have more rate that's going to earn in, and as Tom mentioned, we feel really good about our capabilities in homeowners and we are going to continue to lean-in and look to grow that business. From a bundling perspective, just 80% of our homeowners' customers have a supporting line are bundled. That's a pretty meaningful number and it happens at discount, it's upwards of 15%. And again, what we think with that pricing the lifetime value of that bundled segment is substantial and we will write bundled customers all day long. Our agents are writing bundled business at an all-time high level north of 70% of new business we are incenting agents to write that, we are seeing more bundled business come through our call centers and our direct business. And as I talked earlier Custom 360 going up market is both in auto and home offering. So we think we are well-positioned across all three channels to continue to attract bundled business that we can be even more competitively priced and because of the discounting element, but also it's a segment that we think generates substantial lifetime value and we are good at it, so we are going to keep that. We don't do a forecast for either frequency or severity on a go-forward basis. I would say it's whatever it is, we will make sure we get priced for it."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrent Vandermause: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and our strategy. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning. We appreciate your investment in time in Allstate. Let's start with an overview of results and then Mario and Jess will walk through our operating performance. Let's begin on Slide 2. So our strategy's 2 components: increase personal Property-Liability market share. And expand protection provided to customers which are shown in the 2 over on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the quarter. We made good progress on improving auto insurance profitability. There is more to be done but you can see the improving trend again this quarter. We decided to pursue our sale of Allstate's Health and Benefits businesses. After successful integration of Allstate's voluntary benefits business, with National General's group and individual health businesses, we've created a really well-positioned benefits platform and that strategy was part of the National General acquisition plan. Our success now positions us to achieve additional growth that potential could be maximized by aligning this platform with a broader set of complementary products, distribution channels and capabilities. We anticipate completing a transaction in 2024. We also made progress in executing and transformative growth initiatives to set the stage for personal profit liability market share growth as margins improve. The second part of our strategy to broaden protection offerings also progressed with Allstate Protection Plans growth. Let's review the financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $14.5 billion in the third quarter increased 9.8% above the prior year at $1.3 billion. The increase was driven by higher property liability earned premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, primarily reflecting the 2022 and 2023 rate increases. Which has resulted in Property-Liability earned premium growth of 10%. Net investment income of $689 million reflects proactive portfolio actions, including extending fixed income duration and lowering public equity holdings to take advantage of higher fixed income yields. Net loss of $41 million and adjusted net income of $214 million that's $0.81 per diluted share reflects improved profit liability underwriting performance. Property-Liability recorded an underwriting loss of $414 million which compares to $1.3 billion loss in the third quarter of 2022. While the improvement was encouraging, loss cost trends remain elevated and require continued execution of auto insurance profit improvement plan, particularly in California, New York and New Jersey. Slide 4 provides an update on the execution of the 4 components of that plan. Starting with rates; the Allstate brand has implemented 26.4% of rates since 2022, including 9.5% through the first 3 quarters of 2023. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022 and an additional 8.8% through the first 9 months in 2023. We will continue to pursue rate increases to restore auto insurance margins back to target levels. Second, reducing operating expenses is core to both the profit improvement plan. And importantly, the transformative growth plan to become a low-cost provider of protection. Expenses are down and we have a path to further reductions. Third, we've restricted new business growth in areas and classes of business where we are not achieving target returns. Given the success we've had in some areas, we're selectively removing these restrictions in some states and segments; fourth, enhancing claim practices in a high inflationary and increasingly litigious environment are required to deliver customer value. That includes accelerating the settlement of injury claims and increasing in-person inspections. Turning to Slide 5. Let's touch base on why we believe this profit improvement will work in the current competitive environment. Allstate's capabilities and business model have generated industry-leading auto insurance margins over the last 10 years with an average combined ratio of roughly 96.5% and an average underwriting income of $800 million. That represents approximately a 5-point outperformance in the industry which generates an incremental profit of about $1.3 billion annually. Only a few of the other top 10 insurance companies have a similar record. In the current competitive environment, these same capabilities will enable us to continue the progress made in improving auto insurance margins. The rapid rise in auto claim severities eroded profits for the industry with most carriers responding by increasing auto insurance prices and lowering expenses. Allstate Progressive and GEICO has significantly raised auto insurance prices since 2019. State Farms increased its prices to a lesser degree but as a result, appears to be incurring large underwriting losses. Expense reductions are also being pursued by many companies, including lowering advertising spending which has moderated competition for new customers. The impact on policies in force is dependent on each company's individual profit and growth plan. As Mario will discuss, the Allstate brand policies in force has declined, particularly in 4 large states. GEICO's policies in force have declined by a larger amount, while Progressive has grown. Allstate's capabilities will enable achievement of the profit improvement plan in its competitive environment. Now let's review the potential sale of the Health and Benefits business on Slide 6. We acquired National General was primarily to improve our position in independent agent channel for Property-Liability insurance and we've exceeded our goals in that integration. The acquisition also gave us the opportunity to combine Allstate's voluntary benefits business with National General's group and individual health businesses. Successfully combining these into 1 business unit has created a strong benefits platform with substantial additional value can be realized by aligning with a broader set of product offerings, distribution and capabilities such as medical network management. Allstate Health and Benefits separates 3 successful businesses which is shown in the middle there and the $1 trillion employer benefit markets group and individual health when you add those all up. We've been the preeminent voluntary benefits provided for 24 years. With a comprehensive product offering that generates annualized premiums and contract charges of $1 billion and $300 million of new sales. National General's group health business targets the small case size market. And has $700 million of premium in fee revenue. And $400 million in new sales. The individual health protection is provided through both proprietary and third-party products which generates both underwriting and fee income. The Health and Benefits businesses have revenues of $2.3 billion which is 4% of total corporate revenues and adjusted net income of $240 million for the trailing 12 months which you can see in the 2 pie charts in the bottom and it's kind of spread between all the businesses. The employer voluntary benefits and group health businesses when you add them up, have roughly 48,000 relationships ranging from Fortune 50 companies to small businesses and over $4.3 million policies in force. The growth potential of these businesses can be accelerated with greater alignment with a wide range of companies in the market that are shown on the right-hand side. With its attractive business profile and financial results, we expect the transaction to be completed in 2024. In addition to improving profitability and strategically allocating capital, we continue to implement the transformative growth initiative to position the Property-Liability market share gains as margins improve. The fine components initiative was shown as top of Slide 7. Affordable simple connected protection is at the heart of the strategy to further improve customer value. Customers will have access to high-quality protection that better meets your needs at a low cost with hassle-free experiences. However, they choose to access our broad distribution network. We're live in the market with a new business experience and further enhance the connectivity of the Allstate at this week. Mario will discuss our success in expanding customer access. While each transformative growth element is at various stages of maturity. We're moving from Phase III of building new model towards scaling it in Phase IV. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario to go through the Property-Liability results.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Let's start on Slide 8. Our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan is improving margins. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher average premiums which were partially offset by a decline in policies in force. The underwriting loss of $414 million in the quarter improved $878 million compared to the prior year quarter due to the improvement in our auto loss ratio. The chart on the right highlights the components of the 103.4 [ph] combined ratio in the quarter which improved 8.2 points despite a 2.8 point increase in the catastrophe loss ratio compared to prior year. Prior year reserve estimates, excluding catastrophes, were $166 million unfavorable or at 1.4 point [ph] adverse impact on the combined ratio in the quarter. $82 million was attributable to the runoff property liability annual reserve review. And $84 million in Allstate Protection primarily driven by national general personal auto injury coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 91.9 improved by 4.5 points compared to the prior year quarter and 1 point sequentially versus the second quarter of 2023 despite continued elevated severity inflation. Now let's move to Slide 9 to review Allstate's auto insurance profit trends. The third quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 102.1 was 15.3 points [ph] favorable to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earned premium, lower adverse prior year reserve reestimates and expense efficiencies. As a reminder, we continuously assess claim severities as the year progresses. For example, last year, as 2022 developed, we increased current report year ultimate severity expectations which influenced the quarterly reported trends. While loss cost trends remain historically elevated, the pace of increase moderated in the third quarter. As Allstate brand weighted average major coverage severity improved to 9% compared to the 11% estimate as of the end of last quarter. The chart on the left shows the sequential improvement in quarterly underlying combined ratios from 2022 through the current quarter with quarterly reported figures adjusted to the full year severity level for 2022 and 2023 adjusted for current severity estimates as of the third quarter. Higher average premium and the continued execution of our profit improvement plan drove the sequential improvement in underlying combined ratio to 98.8 as reported or a 100.5 in the bar graph when removing the 1.7 point [ph] favorable impact on the third quarter from improved severity for claims reported in the first 2 quarters of the year. The chart on the right portrays how our comprehensive actions are resulting in a higher proportion of the portfolio progressing towards or achieving target levels of profitability. Excluding the 3 large states which generated 45% of Allstate brand auto underwriting loss in 2022, Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 97.2. The Premiums from states with an underlying combined ratio below 100 improved to 59% of the portfolio in the third quarter, doubling from the percentage at year-end 2022 and up almost 10 points from 50% in the second quarter. Slide 10 shows the impact on policies in force from actions to improve profitability. Allstate brand rate increases have exceeded 26% over the last 7 quarters. New issued applications shown in the middle chart, declined 19.5% compared to the prior year quarter, largely driven by actions to reduce growth in unprofitable states. California, New York and New Jersey combined declined 75% compared to the prior year. Allstate brand auto policies in force decreased by 6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, partially driven by the lower new business and also driven by lower retention due to rate increases. Elevated loss trends in Texas required implementation of rate increases of over 50% in the last 21 months. As a result, retention has declined, while profitability has improved. Policies in force in these 4 large states combined decreased by 8.7%, whereas the remaining states declined by 4.7% compared to the prior year through the third quarter. On Slide 11, we take a deeper look at the National General Auto book. While third quarter margins were impacted by $95 million of unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates primarily across liability coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 96.8 in the quarter and 95.7 year-to-date remains largely consistent with the prior year periods. Reflecting higher loss cost expectations given the reserve strengthening to date, offset by higher average premiums and expense efficiencies. The National General business as product, including fee-based revenue features and claims capabilities to accept in the nonstandard auto insurance market. As you can see in the chart on the right, 75% of the written premium growth in the third quarter of 2023 is coming from nonstandard auto which is more profitable than the overall national general auto insurance business. Our new middle-market product, Custom 360, is now available in nearly 1/3 of the U.S. market and is also contributing to growth. While the legacy National General and Encompass businesses which will be run off as we implement custom 360, are having the lowest impact on growth. Slide 12 covers homeowners insurance results which incurred an underwriting loss in Q3, driven by higher catastrophe losses. On the left, you can see net written premium increased 12.1% from the prior year quarter. primarily driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 0.8% increase in policies in force. Allstate Brand average gross written premium per policy increased by 13.2% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by implemented rate increases throughout 2022 and an additional 9.5 points implemented through the first 9 months of 2023. As well as inflation and insurance home replacement costs. The underlying combined ratio of 72.9 improved by 1.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium, lower frequency and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher severity. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the homeowners business. Slide 13 highlights progress on expanding customer access as part of transformative growth. We continue to enhance capabilities across distribution channels and are the only major carrier with competitive offerings and branded agent, independent agent and direct distribution. The exclusive agent channel represents the majority of Allstate's U.S. personal lines premium at approximately $32 billion or roughly 22% market share in this channel. Our exclusive agents continue to be a strength, offering personalized local advice customers value in this $145 billion market. While exclusive agent auto new business decreased by 5% overall, applications per agency, excluding California, New York and New Jersey has increased by 13.4% so far this year. In addition, modifications to compensation have driven bundling at point of sale to an all-time high of over 75%. Agent performance continues to improve as they adapt to new compensation programs. We also have great growth potential through independent agents. The acquisition of National General strategically positioned Allstate to grow in the independent agent channel. National General continues to profitably grow nonstandard auto, while converting legacy Encompass and Allstate independent agent business onto their platform. Expanded nonstandard auto presence in 12 states represented 9% of National General's 12.9% increase in policies in force during 2023. As we leverage Allstate's expertise in standard auto and homeowners, this channel should represent another source of profitable growth. The direct channel had a significant decline in new business volume this year since this was the most effective place to reduce new business volume and was the most impacted by the reduction in advertising. We have improved our capabilities in this channel, so it will be another source of growth moving forward. And now, I'll hand it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results.\nJesse Merten: All right. Thank you, Mario. I'll start on Slide 14 to discuss investment results. We proactively repositioned our investment portfolio based on continuous monitoring of changes in the economic environment, current market conditions and enterprise risk and return considerations. As shown in the chart on the left, net investment income totaled $689 million in the quarter, relatively flat to the third quarter of last year but with a higher contribution from the market-based portfolio. Market-based income of $567 million shown in blue, was $165 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration bonds, a reduction of public equity holdings and higher interest rates. The chart on the right shows changes we made to the duration of the bond portfolio in comparison to interest rates. In 2021, we began reducing duration to reflect the belief that interest rates would rise. This not only reduced some losses as rates increased but it provided flexibility to reposition as yields increased. Starting in the middle of last year, we began increasing duration as rates increased which has increased market-based income. On Slide 15, let's take a closer look at our performance-based portfolio which offers diversification and enhances longer-term returns. The portfolio is anchored in private equity and real estate is diversified across infrastructure, energy, agriculture and timber investments. We hold more than 400 names, including funds with multiple underlying positions across diversified vintage years. These investments are focused on long-term value creation and we expect quarter-to-quarter income volatility as seen in the bars on the chart to the left, where quarterly returns have ranged from a negative 2.3% and to positive 8.6% over the last 5 years. The benefit from accepting this volatility is shown on the right with 3- and 5-year annualized returns of 19% and 12%. The private equity portion of the portfolio has outperformed public equity benchmarks over 3, 5 and 10 years. Slide 16 covers the results of our Protection Services businesses. Revenues in these businesses increased 8.9% to $697 million in the third quarter compared to prior year quarter. Increase is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans which increased 19.2% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded products and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see that adjusted net income of $27 million in the third quarter decreased $8 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the higher appliance and furniture claims severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. These were partially offset by improved margins at Allstate Roadside and lower expenses at Allstate Identity Protection. Shifting to Slide 17. Our Health and Benefits business also had good results. Both revenues and income increased significantly with the National General acquisition in 2021 as we added scale and capabilities. For the third quarter of 2023, revenues of $587 million increased by $17 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in premiums, contract charges and other revenue in group health which was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employer voluntary benefits. Adjusted net income of $69 million in the third quarter of 2023 increased $6 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to increases in group and individual health revenue and lower operating expenses. Now let's move to Slide 18 and discuss Allstate's approach to capital management to clarify how this differs from traditional methods used to evaluate capital such as the ratio of premiums to statutory surplus. On the left hand of the slide, we summarized 3 discrete components we evaluate to establish target capital which is the basis of our capital management framework. Base capital at the bottom is the capital required to meet ongoing operating requirements. Stress Capital is an additional layer of capital needed to cover tail events for the occurrence of multiple negative impacts, such as lower auto profitability and high catastrophe losses. The contingent reserve is for extremely low frequency and high severity events, a severe breakdown in diversification benefits and also provide strategic flexibility. We use a highly sophisticated model that breaks out individual risk types incorporates regulatory and rating agency considerations and uses extensive simulations to determine the right amount of capital for each component. This is more sophisticated and comprehensive than the ratio of premiums to surplus to determine the right amount of capital. For example, when calculating the premium to surplus ratio for the Allstate Insurance Company, the premiums for many of our subsidiary companies are included but over $1.6 billion of statutory capital is not included in the denominator. This framework also better assesses the use of catastrophe reinsurance particularly for large tail events then a simple ratio. Our sophisticated model and proactive actions provide flexibility to manage capital to maximize shareholder value creation. To close, let's turn to Slide 19 and recap all state strategic priorities. We continue making progress on our plan to return auto insurance profitability to targeted levels. We will pursue the divestiture of our Health and Benefits business, we're continuing to advance on our transformative growth initiatives. Proactive investment management has increased income. Allstate Protection Plans is expanding and these strategic priorities support value creation for Allstate shareholders. With that context, let's open the line to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James.\nGregory Peters: I guess for the first question and there was a lot to unpack in your release and slide deck. I'm going to focus on Slide 7 which is the transformative growth strategy. I was looking at your slide and it talks about building the new model and scaling the new model. And I'm just curious if you're running elevated expenses at this point because you're running 2 separate models. And as you roll out the model, I'm curious about how it's accounting for the nuances of different customers. And I'm thinking about the needs of preferred customers versus standard versus nonstandard?\nTom Wilson: Greg, good question. Let me -- so first, the transformative growth is about increasing market share in personal profit liability. It's got a couple of components at the core of that is being low-cost insurance but also about raising customer value and also about being available to people however they want to get to a specter segment and the customers. So I would say at this point, we've proven out that the underlying assumptions that we had made going into it work. So we know that lower price raises close right. We know that's true. We know that being available through more people, whether that's through different bundling with exclusive agents through independent agents or direct also works and we can do that. We know we can raise customer value, as you saw on the slide there, I didn't dig go into it but the new sales process is really slick. I mean it pops up with offers that are specifically for you, you don't have to pick your deductible, you don't have to go through a bunch of questions. People don't pick the deductible for you. It's fast, it's slick, then the renters piece which is in the middle one, takes less than a minute and we're finding great ways to attach more protection by making it simpler for customers. We're also making it more connected which is in the right-hand side. And so we relaunched the. We think that people are going to have fewer apps on their phone going forward. So having an app where people could just access either look at their bill or get their ID card is helpful but it's not compelling. So we are expanding that. So you'll see on their gas body. You can get figure out how to save money on buying gas which is, of course, directly related to what we do. We have a whole bunch of other things that we've either added or going to add. For example, we are really terrific on crash detection with our telematics experience through Arty and do that through Light 360 and it's a terrific product. So there's a variety of things we're doing to expand that. As it relates to expenses, we're continuing to invest in this. I don't know that I would say it's over expense it's just we have an objective. We have to lower our overall expenses. We're after that but we're not backing off on investing in the new technology. One of the things that we've proved out the underlying assumptions was can we build the technology to do what you see on that screen. And the answer is yes. We've built it, it's out -- it's working, it's rolling. We need to scale it but we have high confidence that it's scalable. So -- you should expect us to continue to find ways to reduce cost to live into this. But I don't think like there's like -- we're running hot in expenses today because of that. As it relates to the various segments of customers, we want to sell as many people as we can as much stuff as we can. However they want to come. If you want an agent, we'll give you an agent. We just have to make sure it's cost is what you're prepared to pay and they do what you want. -- whether that's an exclusive agent or an independent agent. And if you want to buy direct for the company, you want to buy to call so you want to buy on the web. We just want to make it as simple and easy as you can which we think is differentiated in the marketplace.\nGregory Peters: Well, that makes sense. I guess for my follow-up, I'm going to pivot to the pricing slides. I'm thinking Slides 9 and 10. And was wondering if you could -- I know you provided detail in your comments but if you could give us an update on the problematic states. I think in Slide 9, you said 41% of the -- of your business in auto is running above 100. If we look forward to 2024, how do you think this chart might look?\nTom Wilson: Which chart are you referring to, Greg?\nGregory Peters: [Indiscernible].\nTom Wilson: Yes. I mean, of course, it all depends. Mario can give you some color as well. But it all depends what happens in California, New York and New Jersey. But let me be very clear, we are not going to continue to lose -- 4 digits in millions in those 3 states. So far, Mario has talked about us getting smaller by not growing we've executed that. The next step is to not be able to serve customers who we want to serve because we can't afford to those $0.20 on the dollar. Mario, do you want to comment on? Like we've been talking -- it's not like this as we just figured this out or they're not aware of.\nMario Rizzo: Just to give you a little additional color across the 3 states. And Tom is right, we've been talking about this all year and we've taken pretty significant actions to restrict new business volumes and it's down like we talked about earlier, about 75%. We've got 3 significant rates pending rate pending across all 3 states. We have an auto rate in California that we filed back in May, I believe, 35% we've got a 29% filing pending in New Jersey. We implemented rates in New York ranging from high single digits to low double digits or low teens across our opening closed books middle of the year. We just filed for another 18.3% in New York auto. So we've got significant rates pending with the department. As Tom mentioned, where we're at now is we need action those filings in the fourth quarter. And if we can't, then we believe the right thing to do for the customers in the other 47 states as well as for our shareholders is to take additional action to get smaller across all 3 of those states and that's what we would do beginning next year if we can't get resolution on the rate filings that are currently pending.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Marley [ph] on for Alex. So you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you were increasing in-person inspections to reduce overall claim costs. Could you touch on this a little bit more? How impactful is this? And then maybe how many of the current accidents are assessed now in person versus remote? And then how should we think about this for near-term changes to loss LAE?\nMario Rizzo: Marley, this is Mario. I'll answer your question. So I would -- where I would start is going back to the different components of our auto profit improvement plan, taking rate increases, reducing costs, restricting new business in states where we aren't achieving target levels of profitability and improving operational processes and claims what you're describing around more in-person inspections is a component of that fourth piece of improving operational processes. We believe that by doing more physical inspections doing more oversight broadly of both in-network and out-of-network shops as well as doing the same thing on the property side as well that we'll be able to identify opportunities pay what we owe but also not pay for, say, things like pre-existing damage or in total loss cases, cars that could be repaired versus replace. So we think doing more in-person physical inspections in addition to continuing to leverage quick photo claim capabilities is the right thing to do to best manage loss cost going forward and that's what we intend to do to ensure that we're operationally excellent in claims and again, paying what we owe but eliminating any leakage in the system and we're prepared to invest in the claims organization to be able to execute on that. So in terms of the expense ratio, the LAE ratio as part of our adjusted expense ratio. We're still committed to hitting the 23 by the end of next year. The investments we'll make in claims are inclusive of that goal. We think we can do both.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then I just wanted to get your thoughts on longer-term severity drivers that you're seeing in terms of medical inflation and any impacts from the UAW strike?\nMario Rizzo: Sure. So we'll start with medical inflation. And you'll note that we talked about our severity expectations in auto being about 9% currently which has improved from the 11% we talked about last quarter. All that improvement came from physical damage coverages. Our outlook on casualty and injury severity is unchanged. It didn't get worse but it's consistent with where we were last quarter. And the drivers behind that continue to be medical inflation more attorney representation, higher levels of treatment being pursued kind of all the components of both kind of economic and social inflation that have driven injury severities up. Overtime, those will continue to be headwinds for us. But as we -- again, as I talked about on the physical damage side, as we've adapted our claims processes to take into account those inflationary trends, we've seen some good progress. So we're looking to settle claims earlier in the cycle and we've seen a real improvement in terms of reduction in pending injury claims as well as faster settlement times on injury claims. We're using things like analytics and testing AI models to identify accidents where injuries are likely and those that have a higher likelihood of potentially being represented by attorney so that we can further accelerate claimant contact time and get out ahead of the process and manage the overall claim process. So we're doing things proactively to help mitigate some of those inflationary impacts. And we'll continue to do that. And like I said, we did see some stability in injury severity trends during the quarter.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, during the quarter, you guys spoke about looking to buy some additional aggregate stop-loss reinsurance. Do you have any update on what you're doing on the reinsurance side in terms of looking to protect your capital position?\nJesse Merten: Yes, Elyse. Thanks. This is Jess. We have talked a lot about our reinsurance program in general. As you know, we have a robust reinsurance program that reduces our overall capital levels. We've talked more recently about the aggregate cover. At this point, we don't have specific updates about the potential transaction. As I've talked about a number of times, we're looking at whether or not we can economically reduce overall risk and target capital. And to the extent we find a structure where we can get that done, we'll do it. And to the extent we can't get it done economically we'll move on and look at other options. So I would say, as it relates to this quarter, no updates. We continue to be interested in understanding what might be available to attract some new capital. sources into the industry and make them available. But we don't have anything firm to talk about at this point on that.\nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, you guys highlighted that you're looking into a potential transaction with the benefits business. Were there any diversification credits that you guys got from a capital perspective by owning the benefits business?\nTom Wilson: Of course, yes. So they're there but we factor that into our overall position here.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from BMO.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jack [ph] on for Mike. Just one question on changes to Allstate's captive distribution commission and fee structure. I think you mentioned earlier, how it has driven greater bundling rates. I'm just wondering does also expect this change to impact overall organic growth levels? And do you expect a meaningful benefit to the company's expense ratio?\nTom Wilson: Well, I think when you go all the way up to transformative growth. Yes, we think that the whole package of stuff will drive market share growth. That includes making sure that the agents do what customers want them to do and that they're supported in doing that with technology and everything else in marketing and that they're well compensated for what they do. But yes, so there's various pieces on Mario, do you want to talk specifically about the account changes?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. So again, I would characterize the most recent set of changes as a continuation of what we started really several years ago which was intended to drive higher levels of productivity in the exclusive agent distribution system but also reduced distribution costs over time. And I think what we're seeing if you -- particularly if you take out the impacts of the 3 large states where we're purposely driving reduced volume is exactly what we had hoped would happen. So from an expense standpoint, you see in the quarter, we benefited by 2 or 3 from [ph] the distribution cost perspective. So we're continuing to see the impacts and benefits of lower distribution costs. but more importantly, the productivity of the exclusive agency system continues to improve. So I can take out those 3 states, overall production was up 7.6%. Average productivity was up over 13%. And when you look at our top tier of agents, we segment agents into 3 categories, emerging Pro and Elite, that elite group, their level of production was up 15%. So that shows that agents continue to invest in their businesses and take advantage of increased shopping levels in the marketplace but they're focused on driving the kind of growth that will certainly become a real asset for us as we begin to lean back into growth as different states hit target levels of profitability. So we're really encouraged, both in terms of the performance of our agency channel, how they've adapted and the fact that we've been able to take cost out of the distribution system at the same time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Bank of America.\nJoshua Shanker: I have a model that goes pretty far back. And historically, if you look at reserves and try and analyze that -- it's hard in short-tail lines. Historically, Allstate run at about a 95% paid to incurred loss ratio. For every dollar of loss you put 5 in the reserves for future losses. And that's true in 3Q '23. But for the previous 5 quarters, it ran at an astonishingly low 83%. I know that you try and get the reserves right. But it does feel over this period of elevated loss ratio that the company put a lot more of its reserves of losses into reserve than any time in my model. Is there something different that had gone on over the past 5 quarters now that you're resuming a normal sort of pay to incur trend? Or is it just -- that was unusual period in you needed to put more reserve?\nTom Wilson: Maybe I'll start and then Jess can fill in here. First, Josh but we think the reserves are right and we put up what we think we need to put up when we need to put it up as painful as that was last year. We felt we needed to put it up. When you look at the -- I don't know -- I'm not looking at specific numbers you have but I've been through reserves enough to the paid bounce around a lot. It depends what happened in the pandemic with impending levels and we adjust for all that. So, I would say just may have Jess may have some answer for it. I think Jess and Brent could walk through your model with you and help you see it. But I don't -- like we just think the reserves are right and we put them up when we believe Jess, anything to?\nJesse Merten: No, I would agree with that. I also think you should keep in mind that, that same period was a period of extreme acceleration in the loss cost trend which you wouldn't see over the historical periods, right? So you're going to get a different pay-to-incurred ratio when you have acceleration, the way that we've seen and you saw what our severity trend was last year, you've seen what it is this year. So I think a component of that clearly is just the time period that you're looking at and the acceleration of the underlying trend.\nJoshua Shanker: And if you'll indulge me another question, Allstate over the next 20 years has really changed its geographic footprint away from catastrophe. And obviously, with climate change, people have seen a lot of losses and maybe the severity trend over the long term for cat-exposed properties up. But how does the -- severity trend compare between the trend in generally non-cat-exposed property versus cat exposed property, are states like Illinois and a lot of the Midwest seeing a very different trend than severity trends longer term from weather along the coast?\nTom Wilson: Let me start and then Mario just if you guys want to jump in. First, I would start with saying we've built a really great business model in homeowners just like we make more money than the industry on auto insurance were even better in homeowners. And you see those results over 10 years. You do see this year a lot of catastrophes which is like to have an underwriting loss which we prefer not to have that said, catastrophes happen and that's why people buy insurance. So we're comfortable that, that worked. When you look underneath that and say, okay, what's driving those cat losses storms are more severe now. So just the fact you have a more severe storm will increase the severity of the losses that you have one on a strong, whether that's hail storm or a tornado or a hurricane, it just causes more damage. Underneath both that and a traditional loss are just the normal inflationary pressures. And so the cost of lumber goes up, whether you burn your house down or get knocked down by a hurricane, it's that underlying it. So you have kind of a compounding impact on catastrophes. That said, we're good at it. We manage it by state. So you're correct, Illinois would have less pressure because it would have less catastrophe losses than perhaps a state along the East Coast or in the Southwest on the coast. So -- we factored that all in and both of those things there. We do think though that we -- you've seen the raise in prices that spend both of those factors have increased it. So the dramatic increase in homeowners insurance prices has been driven by both those factors. Anything to add, Mario [ph]?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Josh, I think you take a step back and say, what are the underlying drivers of the increase in homeowner severity -- and it's principally, as Tom mentioned, it's labor costs and its material cost to repair homes. And to the extent the rates of inflation vary across different parts of the country. Obviously, that will have an influence on state-specific severity. I think it's more driven by that. Than any -- whether it's cat exposed or not cat exposed because those costs just get amplified when there's a large event and we just have to repair a larger volume of homes.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: Is the impetus selling the Health and Benefits business really to unlock capital and to restore some of your contingency capital? Or was the impetus to become a more lean organization and focus more on core offerings?\nTom Wilson: Neither. And nor was it in relationship to any shareholder asking us to pursue a sale. I know a few of you wrote about. Let me just tell you what it is. So -- we're selling the businesses because it's the best way to capture the value credit. They're terrific businesses. I mean we make almost $0.25 billion a year. And we get a good platform, they have low capital requirements. We like the businesses. When we look forward to the future, though, we said we think we can harvest more growth from it if we had more complementary distribution, a broader set of products, capabilities such as network management of a health network like manage that. Those are things that we don't have today. We said we can build those it would take us time and money. On the other hand, we could access those that already exist. But that requires us to let go the success we've created. So we decided to choose the latter path. It had nothing to do with a shareholder coming to us and saying, you should sell this had nothing to do with needing the money, it has everything to do with this is the right way to manage your company to optimize shareholder value which is sometimes you have to let go of the success you've created.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. But maybe as a byproduct, assuming you could hit whatever valuation target range you have in mind might be early but would you have any kind of implied capital relief from your internal model from the sale?\nTom Wilson: These are low capital businesses. So this First, I would say, on the price high would be the appropriate message I'd like you to carry out there because we do like the businesses a lot. Secondly, they're pretty low capital businesses. So whatever the sale price is, will generate additional capital. And then we'll decide what we want to do when we get there. We've got plenty of other growth opportunities. We're doing a lot with to grow market share and profit liability. We don't need to make that decision right now, so we're not going to.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Or could it potentially move down to AIC or accelerate your path to resume buybacks down the road?\nTom Wilson: There's -- we have all the options that you would have to use capital. Organic growth to buying shares back. All those options are out there. We have no set plans for the capital. Right now, we're focused on -- this is a great business. We can help it be an even greater business by letting go of it. So that's what we're going to do.\nJesse Merten: And I would add, Tracy, we -- our capitalization philosophy, as you know, we tend to keep the capital at the holding company to the extent that we can. So I don't believe we have a capital need at AIC that would cause us to want to do that. So I think we would remain with the philosophy of keeping the capital where it's at the holding company level to the extent we have capital management decisions to make, as Tom said, we'll make him when the time comes. But I don't think we have a need for capital in AIC. So I don't know why we would go away from the philosophy of keeping it up and holding company.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. And just quickly on your commentary of extending your asset duration now at 4.6 years. I mean you don't have a life business anymore. You plan to divest the Health and Benefits business. How you think about the optimal asset duration relative to your pro forma duration of your remaining liabilities?\nTom Wilson: Well, we look at it from an enterprise risk and return standpoint. So the first thing we do is say, how much capital do we want to allocate to the investment portfolio. And then John and his team figure out how they best want to allocate that amongst various asset classes. So John may want to make a comment on where we are at today. I would point out that if you look at Slide 14, we made the right calls at the right time.\nMario Rizzo: Yes. I'd just add that -- another thing to consider when one lengthens out duration is just that you keep the appropriate amount of liquidity and flexibility in the portfolio. And I can assure you that we are doing that between the cash that we hold short-term position to other things that we can turn into cash in short order and just maturities by year-end, we're close to $10 billion. So we believe that we're both capturing the additional income that the market is giving us. lengthening out to preserve the capture of that income for a longer period of time, building some resilience into the portfolio in case the economic environment would change, while also providing adequate liquidity.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. So it sounds like you feel comfortable with durational mismatch because of your strong liquidity position. Is that fair?\nTom Wilson: Well, the Property-Liability business is a little different than the life business in terms of matching to liabilities. In the life business scores, we have a set maturity date and you can factor in some stuff and you figure out let's match that off. In the Property-Liability business, of course, the liabilities are much shorter but then they're naturally recurring. So you pay off 1 claim and you get another one. Is that a separate claim or -- and so if you match it to that, you'd be having here for 90 days for a physical damage claims. So it's really more about liquidity and overall risk management. And I would also point out a large part of our set capital is there in case we mess up on underwriting income. And so that has a really long duration on it.\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Tracy, 1 other thing to add, if you look at the slide, the blue line depicts the duration, we've really just reverted back to what's been more of a long-term average for us. So we were at a point in time where we were in a lower level of duration, a lower level of interest rate exposure. We thought that was right given what was happening with the Fed and interest rates in general. Now that rates have climbed back up pretty aggressively. We want to go back to what has been a longer run central tendency for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: I just had a question on the frequency trends that you guys saw in the third quarter. Could you just describe what you guys are seeing. It sounded like that was up a little bit. I was hoping you could put some numbers around it and sort of what you're seeing, especially as it looks like you're shrinking units. I would think that there would be some benefit from improving the mix of business. But I was hoping you could maybe just touch on that.\nMario Rizzo: David, it's Mario. Thanks for the question. I'll talk a little more qualitatively about frequency since we now are disclosing more pure premium trends which combine the overall loss trend. We just think it's a better way for you all to look at and think about auto profitability. But in terms of auto frequency, the headline is it continues to revert back to pre-pandemic levels but remains below where it was in 2019. There continues to be a tailwind when you think about the safety features embedded in vehicles that will continue to help improve frequency, we think, from a long-term trend going forward. And then when you look at the other driver which is driving activity. When we look at our telematics data, we look at the number of miles that a person is driving each day. It's up mid-single digits compared to last year, still skewing less to rush hour times which benefit frequency and more to nonpeak hours. But that trend has been pretty stable over the last several quarters and we feel like we're in a period of stability in terms of driving behavior. So net-net frequency is up modestly. It's a small component of pure premium. So just to give you a couple of numbers. When you adjust out the intra-year impact in pure premium, it's up about 9.7% year-over-year in the quarter and we said severity was up 9% [ph]. So you can see the modest impact that frequency is having, again, as people drive a bit more than they were a year ago.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And you're saying it's a little bit more stable now, so maybe flattens out there at those levels?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, David, the trend has been pretty stable over the last several quarters in terms of when we look at miles driven for our book.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And then for my follow-up, just to add a question on Slide 13 and I appreciate this information on the distribution channels. I was hoping -- it looks like you guys track the TAM by channel pretty closely. Within the exclusive agent channel, how has that TAM been growing -- and I guess, I'm under the impression that it's been shrinking at the expense of the direct and independent agent channels. So just given that backdrop, I'm wondering if you're seeing signs that you think you can sort of buck that trend and start to grow within your exclusive agency channel?\nTom Wilson: Let me David maybe a couple of thoughts. First, there's a lot of analysis on it. People want to tend to like assume that it's a straight line. And actually, there's competition for the customer amongst all of those. So our effort to reduce the cost that Mario talked about in providing an agent is to give customers better value which should take share away from some of the other 2. The independent agents also are a good place people want to come where they don't want to just buy from an insurance company. They want somebody to shop around for them and want them to do the work for it. On the direct channel, obviously, with increased connectivity, the direct channel has certainly grown. But it's also growing a lot because billions of dollars of advertising going to it. So it's an overall ecosystem, I guess, I would say. And so we look at it and like, we want to be there. People want to have buy from a company like Allstate. Allstate brand name, want to go to that agent. We want to be there for that person with everything they have. The same thing if they want someone to shop or on them, don't want to do the work. We want to be in that independent agent channel. And then in a direct channel, if they want to buy directly then. And what we are doing is using the technology between those various things make it an even better value proposition. So we showed you that cell phone which had the 3 offers in it. Imagine an agent now being able to not have to ask you a whole bunch of stuff; what's your deductible, what kind of stuff. But we pre-populate it with, here's what we think David's deductible should be, offer David this package you put them in a different position. So we look at it really as sort of organic and it moves between there. And we want to be there for all of our customers. So it's not like we think 1 is going to win and the other is going to lose. It's just a constant competition to just do a better job for the customers that want to buy it that way. Jonathan, we'll take one more question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our final question for today comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Jen [ph] on for me. Most of my questions are answered just 1 on the growth in 2024. So what is your expectation and plan for next year? Is the nonstandard auto still be the key growth driver -- any color on that would be great?\nTom Wilson: Mario will give you some specifics. I would say that the biggest impact -- so first, we're starting to grow in the Allstate brand. Mario has got a number of states where he's starting to roll out, transform growth in a more aggressive way to capture the market share growth. So we comfortable there. The independent Asian business, we think, will grow through continued expansion of the nonstandard and the Custom 360 Mario talked about, I would say that the biggest driver. The biggest thing we're unclear on right now is what happens in New York, New Jersey and California. That will be the biggest impact on policies in force. May be different than the growth measure you're talking about but certainly, we need to get properly priced in those states. Or else will get smaller in those states. And given that they're a large percentage for our book of business, it will impact overall policy. Mario thing you would add to that?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. The only thing I'd add as we look ahead is -- I think it's important to recognize that we manage the business on a local level. That means state by state, market by market, risk segment by risk segment; that's been the approach we've taken to improve profitability and we're taking that same approach as we look forward in terms of growth. And I think it's -- where we're at is really 2 groupings of states emerging. Tom talked about the 3 that we've just got to get more rate and get more profitable. And before we can even begin to think about growing and investing in growth because it just economically doesn't make sense for us and that's California, New York, New Jersey. The rest of the states that if you divide them, there's a number of states that are already at target levels of profitability and we're beginning to do things like make local marketing investments, leverage a lot of the capabilities we've been building with transformative growth, the momentum we've got in the exclusive agent channel, the improvements we've made in direct and the capabilities we've built there and what we're building in the independent agent channels with things like Custom 360 and nonstandard auto. So we feel like as a system we are much more effectively positioned to grow when the time is right for us to grow. And as we look out into 2024, we think more states will fall into that ready-to-grow category in terms of target levels of profitability. And we look forward to continuing to invest in growth in those states and leverage the capabilities we've been building with transformative growth.\nTom Wilson: So let me close with 4 points which summarize kind of the conversation we had. What's going to drive shareholder back profitability increases, strategic capital allocation great investment returns and then transform growth long-term sustainable growth. We think those 4 things combined make this a great opportunity. Thank you very much. We'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Jesse Merten",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Mario. I'll start on Slide 14 to discuss investment results. We proactively repositioned our investment portfolio based on continuous monitoring of changes in the economic environment, current market conditions and enterprise risk and return considerations. As shown in the chart on the left, net investment income totaled $689 million in the quarter, relatively flat to the third quarter of last year but with a higher contribution from the market-based portfolio. Market-based income of $567 million shown in blue, was $165 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration bonds, a reduction of public equity holdings and higher interest rates. The chart on the right shows changes we made to the duration of the bond portfolio in comparison to interest rates. In 2021, we began reducing duration to reflect the belief that interest rates would rise. This not only reduced some losses as rates increased but it provided flexibility to reposition as yields increased. Starting in the middle of last year, we began increasing duration as rates increased which has increased market-based income. On Slide 15, let's take a closer look at our performance-based portfolio which offers diversification and enhances longer-term returns. The portfolio is anchored in private equity and real estate is diversified across infrastructure, energy, agriculture and timber investments. We hold more than 400 names, including funds with multiple underlying positions across diversified vintage years. These investments are focused on long-term value creation and we expect quarter-to-quarter income volatility as seen in the bars on the chart to the left, where quarterly returns have ranged from a negative 2.3% and to positive 8.6% over the last 5 years. The benefit from accepting this volatility is shown on the right with 3- and 5-year annualized returns of 19% and 12%. The private equity portion of the portfolio has outperformed public equity benchmarks over 3, 5 and 10 years. Slide 16 covers the results of our Protection Services businesses. Revenues in these businesses increased 8.9% to $697 million in the third quarter compared to prior year quarter. Increase is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans which increased 19.2% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded products and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see that adjusted net income of $27 million in the third quarter decreased $8 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the higher appliance and furniture claims severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. These were partially offset by improved margins at Allstate Roadside and lower expenses at Allstate Identity Protection. Shifting to Slide 17. Our Health and Benefits business also had good results. Both revenues and income increased significantly with the National General acquisition in 2021 as we added scale and capabilities. For the third quarter of 2023, revenues of $587 million increased by $17 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in premiums, contract charges and other revenue in group health which was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employer voluntary benefits. Adjusted net income of $69 million in the third quarter of 2023 increased $6 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to increases in group and individual health revenue and lower operating expenses. Now let's move to Slide 18 and discuss Allstate's approach to capital management to clarify how this differs from traditional methods used to evaluate capital such as the ratio of premiums to statutory surplus. On the left hand of the slide, we summarized 3 discrete components we evaluate to establish target capital which is the basis of our capital management framework. Base capital at the bottom is the capital required to meet ongoing operating requirements. Stress Capital is an additional layer of capital needed to cover tail events for the occurrence of multiple negative impacts, such as lower auto profitability and high catastrophe losses. The contingent reserve is for extremely low frequency and high severity events, a severe breakdown in diversification benefits and also provide strategic flexibility. We use a highly sophisticated model that breaks out individual risk types incorporates regulatory and rating agency considerations and uses extensive simulations to determine the right amount of capital for each component. This is more sophisticated and comprehensive than the ratio of premiums to surplus to determine the right amount of capital. For example, when calculating the premium to surplus ratio for the Allstate Insurance Company, the premiums for many of our subsidiary companies are included but over $1.6 billion of statutory capital is not included in the denominator. This framework also better assesses the use of catastrophe reinsurance particularly for large tail events then a simple ratio. Our sophisticated model and proactive actions provide flexibility to manage capital to maximize shareholder value creation. To close, let's turn to Slide 19 and recap all state strategic priorities. We continue making progress on our plan to return auto insurance profitability to targeted levels. We will pursue the divestiture of our Health and Benefits business, we're continuing to advance on our transformative growth initiatives. Proactive investment management has increased income. Allstate Protection Plans is expanding and these strategic priorities support value creation for Allstate shareholders. With that context, let's open the line to your questions. Yes, Elyse. Thanks. This is Jess. We have talked a lot about our reinsurance program in general. As you know, we have a robust reinsurance program that reduces our overall capital levels. We've talked more recently about the aggregate cover. At this point, we don't have specific updates about the potential transaction. As I've talked about a number of times, we're looking at whether or not we can economically reduce overall risk and target capital. And to the extent we find a structure where we can get that done, we'll do it. And to the extent we can't get it done economically we'll move on and look at other options. So I would say, as it relates to this quarter, no updates. We continue to be interested in understanding what might be available to attract some new capital. sources into the industry and make them available. But we don't have anything firm to talk about at this point on that. No, I would agree with that. I also think you should keep in mind that, that same period was a period of extreme acceleration in the loss cost trend which you wouldn't see over the historical periods, right? So you're going to get a different pay-to-incurred ratio when you have acceleration, the way that we've seen and you saw what our severity trend was last year, you've seen what it is this year. So I think a component of that clearly is just the time period that you're looking at and the acceleration of the underlying trend. And I would add, Tracy, we -- our capitalization philosophy, as you know, we tend to keep the capital at the holding company to the extent that we can. So I don't believe we have a capital need at AIC that would cause us to want to do that. So I think we would remain with the philosophy of keeping the capital where it's at the holding company level to the extent we have capital management decisions to make, as Tom said, we'll make him when the time comes. But I don't think we have a need for capital in AIC. So I don't know why we would go away from the philosophy of keeping it up and holding company."

Let's begin on Slide 2. So our strategy's 2 components: increase personal Property-Liability market share. And expand protection provided to customers which are shown in the 2 over on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the quarter. We made good progress on improving auto insurance profitability. There is more to be done but you can see the improving trend again this quarter. We decided to pursue our sale of Allstate's Health and Benefits businesses. After successful integration of Allstate's voluntary benefits business, with National General's group and individual health businesses, we've created a really well-positioned benefits platform and that strategy was part of the National General acquisition plan. Our success now positions us to achieve additional growth that potential could be maximized by aligning this platform with a broader set of complementary products, distribution channels and capabilities. We anticipate completing a transaction in 2024. We also made progress in executing and transformative growth initiatives to set the stage for personal profit liability market share growth as margins improve. The second part of our strategy to broaden protection offerings also progressed with Allstate Protection Plans growth. Let's review the financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $14.5 billion in the third quarter increased 9.8% above the prior year at $1.3 billion. The increase was driven by higher property liability earned premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, primarily reflecting the 2022 and 2023 rate increases. Which has resulted in Property-Liability earned premium growth of 10%. Net investment income of $689 million reflects proactive portfolio actions, including extending fixed income duration and lowering public equity holdings to take advantage of higher fixed income yields. Net loss of $41 million and adjusted net income of $214 million that's $0.81 per diluted share reflects improved profit liability underwriting performance. Property-Liability recorded an underwriting loss of $414 million which compares to $1.3 billion loss in the third quarter of 2022. While the improvement was encouraging, loss cost trends remain elevated and require continued execution of auto insurance profit improvement plan, particularly in California, New York and New Jersey. Slide 4 provides an update on the execution of the 4 components of that plan. Starting with rates; the Allstate brand has implemented 26.4% of rates since 2022, including 9.5% through the first 3 quarters of 2023. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022 and an additional 8.8% through the first 9 months in 2023. We will continue to pursue rate increases to restore auto insurance margins back to target levels. Second, reducing operating expenses is core to both the profit improvement plan. And importantly, the transformative growth plan to become a low-cost provider of protection. Expenses are down and we have a path to further reductions. Third, we've restricted new business growth in areas and classes of business where we are not achieving target returns. Given the success we've had in some areas, we're selectively removing these restrictions in some states and segments; fourth, enhancing claim practices in a high inflationary and increasingly litigious environment are required to deliver customer value. That includes accelerating the settlement of injury claims and increasing in-person inspections. Turning to Slide 5. Let's touch base on why we believe this profit improvement will work in the current competitive environment. Allstate's capabilities and business model have generated industry-leading auto insurance margins over the last 10 years with an average combined ratio of roughly 96.5% and an average underwriting income of $800 million. That represents approximately a 5-point outperformance in the industry which generates an incremental profit of about $1.3 billion annually. Only a few of the other top 10 insurance companies have a similar record. In the current competitive environment, these same capabilities will enable us to continue the progress made in improving auto insurance margins. The rapid rise in auto claim severities eroded profits for the industry with most carriers responding by increasing auto insurance prices and lowering expenses. Allstate Progressive and GEICO has significantly raised auto insurance prices since 2019. State Farms increased its prices to a lesser degree but as a result, appears to be incurring large underwriting losses. Expense reductions are also being pursued by many companies, including lowering advertising spending which has moderated competition for new customers. The impact on policies in force is dependent on each company's individual profit and growth plan. As Mario will discuss, the Allstate brand policies in force has declined, particularly in 4 large states. GEICO's policies in force have declined by a larger amount, while Progressive has grown. Allstate's capabilities will enable achievement of the profit improvement plan in its competitive environment. Now let's review the potential sale of the Health and Benefits business on Slide 6. We acquired National General was primarily to improve our position in independent agent channel for Property-Liability insurance and we've exceeded our goals in that integration. The acquisition also gave us the opportunity to combine Allstate's voluntary benefits business with National General's group and individual health businesses. Successfully combining these into 1 business unit has created a strong benefits platform with substantial additional value can be realized by aligning with a broader set of product offerings, distribution and capabilities such as medical network management. Allstate Health and Benefits separates 3 successful businesses which is shown in the middle there and the $1 trillion employer benefit markets group and individual health when you add those all up. We've been the preeminent voluntary benefits provided for 24 years. With a comprehensive product offering that generates annualized premiums and contract charges of $1 billion and $300 million of new sales. National General's group health business targets the small case size market. And has $700 million of premium in fee revenue. And $400 million in new sales. The individual health protection is provided through both proprietary and third-party products which generates both underwriting and fee income. The Health and Benefits businesses have revenues of $2.3 billion which is 4% of total corporate revenues and adjusted net income of $240 million for the trailing 12 months which you can see in the 2 pie charts in the bottom and it's kind of spread between all the businesses. The employer voluntary benefits and group health businesses when you add them up, have roughly 48,000 relationships ranging from Fortune 50 companies to small businesses and over $4.3 million policies in force. The growth potential of these businesses can be accelerated with greater alignment with a wide range of companies in the market that are shown on the right-hand side. With its attractive business profile and financial results, we expect the transaction to be completed in 2024. In addition to improving profitability and strategically allocating capital, we continue to implement the transformative growth initiative to position the Property-Liability market share gains as margins improve. The fine components initiative was shown as top of Slide 7. Affordable simple connected protection is at the heart of the strategy to further improve customer value. Customers will have access to high-quality protection that better meets your needs at a low cost with hassle-free experiences. However, they choose to access our broad distribution network. We're live in the market with a new business experience and further enhance the connectivity of the Allstate at this week. Mario will discuss our success in expanding customer access. While each transformative growth element is at various stages of maturity. We're moving from Phase III of building new model towards scaling it in Phase IV. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario to go through the Property-Liability results. Greg, good question. Let me -- so first, the transformative growth is about increasing market share in personal profit liability. It's got a couple of components at the core of that is being low-cost insurance but also about raising customer value and also about being available to people however they want to get to a specter segment and the customers. So I would say at this point, we've proven out that the underlying assumptions that we had made going into it work. So we know that lower price raises close right. We know that's true. We know that being available through more people, whether that's through different bundling with exclusive agents through independent agents or direct also works and we can do that. We know we can raise customer value, as you saw on the slide there, I didn't dig go into it but the new sales process is really slick. I mean it pops up with offers that are specifically for you, you don't have to pick your deductible, you don't have to go through a bunch of questions. People don't pick the deductible for you. It's fast, it's slick, then the renters piece which is in the middle one, takes less than a minute and we're finding great ways to attach more protection by making it simpler for customers. We're also making it more connected which is in the right-hand side. And so we relaunched the. We think that people are going to have fewer apps on their phone going forward. So having an app where people could just access either look at their bill or get their ID card is helpful but it's not compelling. So we are expanding that. So you'll see on their gas body. You can get figure out how to save money on buying gas which is, of course, directly related to what we do. We have a whole bunch of other things that we've either added or going to add. For example, we are really terrific on crash detection with our telematics experience through Arty and do that through Light 360 and it's a terrific product. So there's a variety of things we're doing to expand that. As it relates to expenses, we're continuing to invest in this. I don't know that I would say it's over expense it's just we have an objective. We have to lower our overall expenses. We're after that but we're not backing off on investing in the new technology. One of the things that we've proved out the underlying assumptions was can we build the technology to do what you see on that screen. And the answer is yes. We've built it, it's out -- it's working, it's rolling. We need to scale it but we have high confidence that it's scalable. So -- you should expect us to continue to find ways to reduce cost to live into this. But I don't think like there's like -- we're running hot in expenses today because of that. As it relates to the various segments of customers, we want to sell as many people as we can as much stuff as we can. However they want to come. If you want an agent, we'll give you an agent. We just have to make sure it's cost is what you're prepared to pay and they do what you want. -- whether that's an exclusive agent or an independent agent. And if you want to buy direct for the company, you want to buy to call so you want to buy on the web. We just want to make it as simple and easy as you can which we think is differentiated in the marketplace. Which chart are you referring to, Greg? Yes. I mean, of course, it all depends. Mario can give you some color as well. But it all depends what happens in California, New York and New Jersey. But let me be very clear, we are not going to continue to lose -- 4 digits in millions in those 3 states. So far, Mario has talked about us getting smaller by not growing we've executed that. The next step is to not be able to serve customers who we want to serve because we can't afford to those $0.20 on the dollar. Mario, do you want to comment on? Like we've been talking -- it's not like this as we just figured this out or they're not aware of. Of course, yes. So they're there but we factor that into our overall position here. Well, I think when you go all the way up to transformative growth. Yes, we think that the whole package of stuff will drive market share growth. That includes making sure that the agents do what customers want them to do and that they're supported in doing that with technology and everything else in marketing and that they're well compensated for what they do. But yes, so there's various pieces on Mario, do you want to talk specifically about the account changes? Maybe I'll start and then Jess can fill in here. First, Josh but we think the reserves are right and we put up what we think we need to put up when we need to put it up as painful as that was last year. We felt we needed to put it up. When you look at the -- I don't know -- I'm not looking at specific numbers you have but I've been through reserves enough to the paid bounce around a lot. It depends what happened in the pandemic with impending levels and we adjust for all that. So, I would say just may have Jess may have some answer for it. I think Jess and Brent could walk through your model with you and help you see it. But I don't -- like we just think the reserves are right and we put them up when we believe Jess, anything to? Let me start and then Mario just if you guys want to jump in. First, I would start with saying we've built a really great business model in homeowners just like we make more money than the industry on auto insurance were even better in homeowners. And you see those results over 10 years. You do see this year a lot of catastrophes which is like to have an underwriting loss which we prefer not to have that said, catastrophes happen and that's why people buy insurance. So we're comfortable that, that worked. When you look underneath that and say, okay, what's driving those cat losses storms are more severe now. So just the fact you have a more severe storm will increase the severity of the losses that you have one on a strong, whether that's hail storm or a tornado or a hurricane, it just causes more damage. Underneath both that and a traditional loss are just the normal inflationary pressures. And so the cost of lumber goes up, whether you burn your house down or get knocked down by a hurricane, it's that underlying it. So you have kind of a compounding impact on catastrophes. That said, we're good at it. We manage it by state. So you're correct, Illinois would have less pressure because it would have less catastrophe losses than perhaps a state along the East Coast or in the Southwest on the coast. So -- we factored that all in and both of those things there. We do think though that we -- you've seen the raise in prices that spend both of those factors have increased it. So the dramatic increase in homeowners insurance prices has been driven by both those factors. Anything to add, Mario [ph]? Neither. And nor was it in relationship to any shareholder asking us to pursue a sale. I know a few of you wrote about. Let me just tell you what it is. So -- we're selling the businesses because it's the best way to capture the value credit. They're terrific businesses. I mean we make almost $0.25 billion a year. And we get a good platform, they have low capital requirements. We like the businesses. When we look forward to the future, though, we said we think we can harvest more growth from it if we had more complementary distribution, a broader set of products, capabilities such as network management of a health network like manage that. Those are things that we don't have today. We said we can build those it would take us time and money. On the other hand, we could access those that already exist. But that requires us to let go the success we've created. So we decided to choose the latter path. It had nothing to do with a shareholder coming to us and saying, you should sell this had nothing to do with needing the money, it has everything to do with this is the right way to manage your company to optimize shareholder value which is sometimes you have to let go of the success you've created. These are low capital businesses. So this First, I would say, on the price high would be the appropriate message I'd like you to carry out there because we do like the businesses a lot. Secondly, they're pretty low capital businesses. So whatever the sale price is, will generate additional capital. And then we'll decide what we want to do when we get there. We've got plenty of other growth opportunities. We're doing a lot with to grow market share and profit liability. We don't need to make that decision right now, so we're not going to. There's -- we have all the options that you would have to use capital. Organic growth to buying shares back. All those options are out there. We have no set plans for the capital. Right now, we're focused on -- this is a great business. We can help it be an even greater business by letting go of it. So that's what we're going to do. Well, we look at it from an enterprise risk and return standpoint. So the first thing we do is say, how much capital do we want to allocate to the investment portfolio. And then John and his team figure out how they best want to allocate that amongst various asset classes. So John may want to make a comment on where we are at today. I would point out that if you look at Slide 14, we made the right calls at the right time. Well, the Property-Liability business is a little different than the life business in terms of matching to liabilities. In the life business scores, we have a set maturity date and you can factor in some stuff and you figure out let's match that off. In the Property-Liability business, of course, the liabilities are much shorter but then they're naturally recurring. So you pay off 1 claim and you get another one. Is that a separate claim or -- and so if you match it to that, you'd be having here for 90 days for a physical damage claims. So it's really more about liquidity and overall risk management. And I would also point out a large part of our set capital is there in case we mess up on underwriting income. And so that has a really long duration on it. Let me David maybe a couple of thoughts. First, there's a lot of analysis on it. People want to tend to like assume that it's a straight line. And actually, there's competition for the customer amongst all of those. So our effort to reduce the cost that Mario talked about in providing an agent is to give customers better value which should take share away from some of the other 2. The independent agents also are a good place people want to come where they don't want to just buy from an insurance company. They want somebody to shop around for them and want them to do the work for it. On the direct channel, obviously, with increased connectivity, the direct channel has certainly grown. But it's also growing a lot because billions of dollars of advertising going to it. So it's an overall ecosystem, I guess, I would say. And so we look at it and like, we want to be there. People want to have buy from a company like Allstate. Allstate brand name, want to go to that agent. We want to be there for that person with everything they have. The same thing if they want someone to shop or on them, don't want to do the work. We want to be in that independent agent channel. And then in a direct channel, if they want to buy directly then. And what we are doing is using the technology between those various things make it an even better value proposition. So we showed you that cell phone which had the 3 offers in it. Imagine an agent now being able to not have to ask you a whole bunch of stuff; what's your deductible, what kind of stuff. But we pre-populate it with, here's what we think David's deductible should be, offer David this package you put them in a different position. So we look at it really as sort of organic and it moves between there. And we want to be there for all of our customers. So it's not like we think 1 is going to win and the other is going to lose. It's just a constant competition to just do a better job for the customers that want to buy it that way. Jonathan, we'll take one more question. Mario will give you some specifics. I would say that the biggest impact -- so first, we're starting to grow in the Allstate brand. Mario has got a number of states where he's starting to roll out, transform growth in a more aggressive way to capture the market share growth. So we comfortable there. The independent Asian business, we think, will grow through continued expansion of the nonstandard and the Custom 360 Mario talked about, I would say that the biggest driver. The biggest thing we're unclear on right now is what happens in New York, New Jersey and California. That will be the biggest impact on policies in force. May be different than the growth measure you're talking about but certainly, we need to get properly priced in those states. Or else will get smaller in those states. And given that they're a large percentage for our book of business, it will impact overall policy. Mario thing you would add to that? So let me close with 4 points which summarize kind of the conversation we had. What's going to drive shareholder back profitability increases, strategic capital allocation great investment returns and then transform growth long-term sustainable growth. We think those 4 things combined make this a great opportunity. Thank you very much. We'll see you next quarter."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's start on Slide 8. Our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan is improving margins. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher average premiums which were partially offset by a decline in policies in force. The underwriting loss of $414 million in the quarter improved $878 million compared to the prior year quarter due to the improvement in our auto loss ratio. The chart on the right highlights the components of the 103.4 [ph] combined ratio in the quarter which improved 8.2 points despite a 2.8 point increase in the catastrophe loss ratio compared to prior year. Prior year reserve estimates, excluding catastrophes, were $166 million unfavorable or at 1.4 point [ph] adverse impact on the combined ratio in the quarter. $82 million was attributable to the runoff property liability annual reserve review. And $84 million in Allstate Protection primarily driven by national general personal auto injury coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 91.9 improved by 4.5 points compared to the prior year quarter and 1 point sequentially versus the second quarter of 2023 despite continued elevated severity inflation. Now let's move to Slide 9 to review Allstate's auto insurance profit trends. The third quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 102.1 was 15.3 points [ph] favorable to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earned premium, lower adverse prior year reserve reestimates and expense efficiencies. As a reminder, we continuously assess claim severities as the year progresses. For example, last year, as 2022 developed, we increased current report year ultimate severity expectations which influenced the quarterly reported trends. While loss cost trends remain historically elevated, the pace of increase moderated in the third quarter. As Allstate brand weighted average major coverage severity improved to 9% compared to the 11% estimate as of the end of last quarter. The chart on the left shows the sequential improvement in quarterly underlying combined ratios from 2022 through the current quarter with quarterly reported figures adjusted to the full year severity level for 2022 and 2023 adjusted for current severity estimates as of the third quarter. Higher average premium and the continued execution of our profit improvement plan drove the sequential improvement in underlying combined ratio to 98.8 as reported or a 100.5 in the bar graph when removing the 1.7 point [ph] favorable impact on the third quarter from improved severity for claims reported in the first 2 quarters of the year. The chart on the right portrays how our comprehensive actions are resulting in a higher proportion of the portfolio progressing towards or achieving target levels of profitability. Excluding the 3 large states which generated 45% of Allstate brand auto underwriting loss in 2022, Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 97.2. The Premiums from states with an underlying combined ratio below 100 improved to 59% of the portfolio in the third quarter, doubling from the percentage at year-end 2022 and up almost 10 points from 50% in the second quarter. Slide 10 shows the impact on policies in force from actions to improve profitability. Allstate brand rate increases have exceeded 26% over the last 7 quarters. New issued applications shown in the middle chart, declined 19.5% compared to the prior year quarter, largely driven by actions to reduce growth in unprofitable states. California, New York and New Jersey combined declined 75% compared to the prior year. Allstate brand auto policies in force decreased by 6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, partially driven by the lower new business and also driven by lower retention due to rate increases. Elevated loss trends in Texas required implementation of rate increases of over 50% in the last 21 months. As a result, retention has declined, while profitability has improved. Policies in force in these 4 large states combined decreased by 8.7%, whereas the remaining states declined by 4.7% compared to the prior year through the third quarter. On Slide 11, we take a deeper look at the National General Auto book. While third quarter margins were impacted by $95 million of unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates primarily across liability coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 96.8 in the quarter and 95.7 year-to-date remains largely consistent with the prior year periods. Reflecting higher loss cost expectations given the reserve strengthening to date, offset by higher average premiums and expense efficiencies. The National General business as product, including fee-based revenue features and claims capabilities to accept in the nonstandard auto insurance market. As you can see in the chart on the right, 75% of the written premium growth in the third quarter of 2023 is coming from nonstandard auto which is more profitable than the overall national general auto insurance business. Our new middle-market product, Custom 360, is now available in nearly 1/3 of the U.S. market and is also contributing to growth. While the legacy National General and Encompass businesses which will be run off as we implement custom 360, are having the lowest impact on growth. Slide 12 covers homeowners insurance results which incurred an underwriting loss in Q3, driven by higher catastrophe losses. On the left, you can see net written premium increased 12.1% from the prior year quarter. primarily driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 0.8% increase in policies in force. Allstate Brand average gross written premium per policy increased by 13.2% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by implemented rate increases throughout 2022 and an additional 9.5 points implemented through the first 9 months of 2023. As well as inflation and insurance home replacement costs. The underlying combined ratio of 72.9 improved by 1.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium, lower frequency and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher severity. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the homeowners business. Slide 13 highlights progress on expanding customer access as part of transformative growth. We continue to enhance capabilities across distribution channels and are the only major carrier with competitive offerings and branded agent, independent agent and direct distribution. The exclusive agent channel represents the majority of Allstate's U.S. personal lines premium at approximately $32 billion or roughly 22% market share in this channel. Our exclusive agents continue to be a strength, offering personalized local advice customers value in this $145 billion market. While exclusive agent auto new business decreased by 5% overall, applications per agency, excluding California, New York and New Jersey has increased by 13.4% so far this year. In addition, modifications to compensation have driven bundling at point of sale to an all-time high of over 75%. Agent performance continues to improve as they adapt to new compensation programs. We also have great growth potential through independent agents. The acquisition of National General strategically positioned Allstate to grow in the independent agent channel. National General continues to profitably grow nonstandard auto, while converting legacy Encompass and Allstate independent agent business onto their platform. Expanded nonstandard auto presence in 12 states represented 9% of National General's 12.9% increase in policies in force during 2023. As we leverage Allstate's expertise in standard auto and homeowners, this channel should represent another source of profitable growth. The direct channel had a significant decline in new business volume this year since this was the most effective place to reduce new business volume and was the most impacted by the reduction in advertising. We have improved our capabilities in this channel, so it will be another source of growth moving forward. And now, I'll hand it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results. Just to give you a little additional color across the 3 states. And Tom is right, we've been talking about this all year and we've taken pretty significant actions to restrict new business volumes and it's down like we talked about earlier, about 75%. We've got 3 significant rates pending rate pending across all 3 states. We have an auto rate in California that we filed back in May, I believe, 35% we've got a 29% filing pending in New Jersey. We implemented rates in New York ranging from high single digits to low double digits or low teens across our opening closed books middle of the year. We just filed for another 18.3% in New York auto. So we've got significant rates pending with the department. As Tom mentioned, where we're at now is we need action those filings in the fourth quarter. And if we can't, then we believe the right thing to do for the customers in the other 47 states as well as for our shareholders is to take additional action to get smaller across all 3 of those states and that's what we would do beginning next year if we can't get resolution on the rate filings that are currently pending. Marley, this is Mario. I'll answer your question. So I would -- where I would start is going back to the different components of our auto profit improvement plan, taking rate increases, reducing costs, restricting new business in states where we aren't achieving target levels of profitability and improving operational processes and claims what you're describing around more in-person inspections is a component of that fourth piece of improving operational processes. We believe that by doing more physical inspections doing more oversight broadly of both in-network and out-of-network shops as well as doing the same thing on the property side as well that we'll be able to identify opportunities pay what we owe but also not pay for, say, things like pre-existing damage or in total loss cases, cars that could be repaired versus replace. So we think doing more in-person physical inspections in addition to continuing to leverage quick photo claim capabilities is the right thing to do to best manage loss cost going forward and that's what we intend to do to ensure that we're operationally excellent in claims and again, paying what we owe but eliminating any leakage in the system and we're prepared to invest in the claims organization to be able to execute on that. So in terms of the expense ratio, the LAE ratio as part of our adjusted expense ratio. We're still committed to hitting the 23 by the end of next year. The investments we'll make in claims are inclusive of that goal. We think we can do both. Sure. So we'll start with medical inflation. And you'll note that we talked about our severity expectations in auto being about 9% currently which has improved from the 11% we talked about last quarter. All that improvement came from physical damage coverages. Our outlook on casualty and injury severity is unchanged. It didn't get worse but it's consistent with where we were last quarter. And the drivers behind that continue to be medical inflation more attorney representation, higher levels of treatment being pursued kind of all the components of both kind of economic and social inflation that have driven injury severities up. Overtime, those will continue to be headwinds for us. But as we -- again, as I talked about on the physical damage side, as we've adapted our claims processes to take into account those inflationary trends, we've seen some good progress. So we're looking to settle claims earlier in the cycle and we've seen a real improvement in terms of reduction in pending injury claims as well as faster settlement times on injury claims. We're using things like analytics and testing AI models to identify accidents where injuries are likely and those that have a higher likelihood of potentially being represented by attorney so that we can further accelerate claimant contact time and get out ahead of the process and manage the overall claim process. So we're doing things proactively to help mitigate some of those inflationary impacts. And we'll continue to do that. And like I said, we did see some stability in injury severity trends during the quarter. Yes. So again, I would characterize the most recent set of changes as a continuation of what we started really several years ago which was intended to drive higher levels of productivity in the exclusive agent distribution system but also reduced distribution costs over time. And I think what we're seeing if you -- particularly if you take out the impacts of the 3 large states where we're purposely driving reduced volume is exactly what we had hoped would happen. So from an expense standpoint, you see in the quarter, we benefited by 2 or 3 from [ph] the distribution cost perspective. So we're continuing to see the impacts and benefits of lower distribution costs. but more importantly, the productivity of the exclusive agency system continues to improve. So I can take out those 3 states, overall production was up 7.6%. Average productivity was up over 13%. And when you look at our top tier of agents, we segment agents into 3 categories, emerging Pro and Elite, that elite group, their level of production was up 15%. So that shows that agents continue to invest in their businesses and take advantage of increased shopping levels in the marketplace but they're focused on driving the kind of growth that will certainly become a real asset for us as we begin to lean back into growth as different states hit target levels of profitability. So we're really encouraged, both in terms of the performance of our agency channel, how they've adapted and the fact that we've been able to take cost out of the distribution system at the same time. Yes. The only thing I'd add, Josh, I think you take a step back and say, what are the underlying drivers of the increase in homeowner severity -- and it's principally, as Tom mentioned, it's labor costs and its material cost to repair homes. And to the extent the rates of inflation vary across different parts of the country. Obviously, that will have an influence on state-specific severity. I think it's more driven by that. Than any -- whether it's cat exposed or not cat exposed because those costs just get amplified when there's a large event and we just have to repair a larger volume of homes. Yes. I'd just add that -- another thing to consider when one lengthens out duration is just that you keep the appropriate amount of liquidity and flexibility in the portfolio. And I can assure you that we are doing that between the cash that we hold short-term position to other things that we can turn into cash in short order and just maturities by year-end, we're close to $10 billion. So we believe that we're both capturing the additional income that the market is giving us. lengthening out to preserve the capture of that income for a longer period of time, building some resilience into the portfolio in case the economic environment would change, while also providing adequate liquidity. Yes. Tracy, 1 other thing to add, if you look at the slide, the blue line depicts the duration, we've really just reverted back to what's been more of a long-term average for us. So we were at a point in time where we were in a lower level of duration, a lower level of interest rate exposure. We thought that was right given what was happening with the Fed and interest rates in general. Now that rates have climbed back up pretty aggressively. We want to go back to what has been a longer run central tendency for us. David, it's Mario. Thanks for the question. I'll talk a little more qualitatively about frequency since we now are disclosing more pure premium trends which combine the overall loss trend. We just think it's a better way for you all to look at and think about auto profitability. But in terms of auto frequency, the headline is it continues to revert back to pre-pandemic levels but remains below where it was in 2019. There continues to be a tailwind when you think about the safety features embedded in vehicles that will continue to help improve frequency, we think, from a long-term trend going forward. And then when you look at the other driver which is driving activity. When we look at our telematics data, we look at the number of miles that a person is driving each day. It's up mid-single digits compared to last year, still skewing less to rush hour times which benefit frequency and more to nonpeak hours. But that trend has been pretty stable over the last several quarters and we feel like we're in a period of stability in terms of driving behavior. So net-net frequency is up modestly. It's a small component of pure premium. So just to give you a couple of numbers. When you adjust out the intra-year impact in pure premium, it's up about 9.7% year-over-year in the quarter and we said severity was up 9% [ph]. So you can see the modest impact that frequency is having, again, as people drive a bit more than they were a year ago. Yes, David, the trend has been pretty stable over the last several quarters in terms of when we look at miles driven for our book. Yes. The only thing I'd add as we look ahead is -- I think it's important to recognize that we manage the business on a local level. That means state by state, market by market, risk segment by risk segment; that's been the approach we've taken to improve profitability and we're taking that same approach as we look forward in terms of growth. And I think it's -- where we're at is really 2 groupings of states emerging. Tom talked about the 3 that we've just got to get more rate and get more profitable. And before we can even begin to think about growing and investing in growth because it just economically doesn't make sense for us and that's California, New York, New Jersey. The rest of the states that if you divide them, there's a number of states that are already at target levels of profitability and we're beginning to do things like make local marketing investments, leverage a lot of the capabilities we've been building with transformative growth, the momentum we've got in the exclusive agent channel, the improvements we've made in direct and the capabilities we've built there and what we're building in the independent agent channels with things like Custom 360 and nonstandard auto. So we feel like as a system we are much more effectively positioned to grow when the time is right for us to grow. And as we look out into 2024, we think more states will fall into that ready-to-grow category in terms of target levels of profitability. And we look forward to continuing to invest in growth in those states and leverage the capabilities we've been building with transformative growth."

After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit your enquiry to one question and one follow-up. As a reminder, please be aware that today\u2019s call is being recorded. And now, I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrent Vandermause: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement, and forward-looking statements about Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning. We appreciate you investing your time in Allstate. Let's start with an overview of results and then Mario and Jesse will walk through operating results and the actions being taken to increase shareholder value. Let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy has two components; increase personal profit liability market share, and expand protection services, which are shown in the two with on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see a summary of results for the second quarter. Progress is being made on the comprehensive plan to improve auto insurance profitability, which includes raising rates, reducing expenses, limiting growth and enhancing claim processes. While auto insurance margins are not at target levels, the proportion of premium associated with states operating and that underlying -- underwriting profit has gone from just under 30% in 2022 to 50% for the first half of this year. Mario will discuss the actions being taken to continue this trend and importantly, improved results in New York, New Jersey and California. Severe weather in the quarter contributed to a net loss of $1.4 billion, 42 catastrophe events impacted 160,000 customers and resulted in $2.7 billion of catastrophe losses and a property liability underwriting loss of $2.1 billion. Strong fixed income results from higher bond yields generated $610 million of investment income and Protection Services and Health and Benefits generated $98 million of profits in the quarter. The transformative growth plan to become the lowest cost protection provider is making continued progress. This both helps current results with lower costs and positions Allstate for sustainable growth when auto margins return to acceptable levels. Affordable, simple and connected property liability products with sophisticated telematics pricing and differentiated direct-to-consumer capabilities are being introduced under the Allstate brand through a new technology platform. National General was growing, which will also increase market share. Specialty auto expertise, along with leveraging auto\u2019s Allstate strength in preferred auto and homeowners insurance products are expected to drive sustainable growth. Allstate Protection Plans is expanding its embedded protection through new products and retail relationships and in international markets. Allstate has a strong capital position with $16.9 billion of statutory surplus and holding company assets, as Jesse will discuss later. And as you know, we have a long history of providing cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 3.9% of outstanding shares for $1.3 billion. We suspended this is repurchase program in July, as we had a net loss for the six months of the year. Improving profitability, increasing property liability, organic growth and broadening protection offered to customers through an extensive distribution platform will increase shareholder value. Let's review financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $14 billion in the second quarter increased 14.4% above the prior year quarter of $1.8 billion. The increase was driven by higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance from rates taken in 2022 and 2023, resulting in property-liability earned premium growth of 9.6%. Net investment income of $610 million reflects the impact of higher fixed income yields and extended duration, which will substantially increase income. This growth more than offset a decline from performance-based investments in the quarter. The net loss of $1.4 billion and an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion reflects a profit liability underwriting loss of $2.1 billion due to the $2.7 billion in catastrophe losses and increased auto insurance loss costs. In auto insurance, higher insurance pros and lower expenses were largely offset by higher catastrophe losses and increased claim frequency and severity. The underlying auto insurance combined ratio did improve slightly for the first six months of 2023 compared to the year-end 2022. Auto insurance had an underwriting loss of $678 million. In homeowners insurance, catastrophe losses were substantially over the 15-year average, resulting in a combined ratio of 145, generating an underwriting loss of $1.3 billion. The underlying combined ratio on homeowners improved 1.9 points to 67.6% as higher average premiums more than offset increased severity. Adjusted net income of $98 million from protection services and health and benefits when combined with the $610 million of investment income offset a portion of the underwriting loss. The target for enterprise adjusted net income return on equity remains at 14% to 17%. I'll now turn it over to Mario to discuss profit liability results.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Let's turn to Slide 4. We are seeing the impact of our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan in our financial results, starting with the rate increases we have implemented to date. The chart on the left shows Property-Liability earned premium increased 9.6% above the prior year quarter, driven by higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, which were partially offset by a decline in policies in force. Price increases and cost reductions were largely offset by severe weather events and increased accident frequency and claim severity. The underwriting loss of $2.1 billion in the quarter was $1.2 billion worse than the prior year quarter due to the $1.6 billion increase in catastrophe losses. The chart on the right highlights the components of the combined ratio, including 22.6 points from catastrophe losses. Prior year reserve reestimates, excluding catastrophes, had a 1.6 point adverse impact on the combined ratio in the quarter. Of the $182 million of strengthening in the second quarter, $148 million was in National General, primarily driven by personal auto injury coverages in the 2022 accident year. In addition, prior years were strengthened by approximately $31 million for litigation activity in the state of Florida related to torque reform that was passed in March of this year. We've been closely monitoring the increase in filed suits on existing claims and the charge reflects a combination of higher legal defense costs and a modest loss reserve adjustment. Despite continuing pressure on the loss side, the underlying combined ratio of 92.9 improved modestly by 0.5 points compared to the prior year quarter and 0.4 points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023. Now, let's move to slide five to discuss Allstate's auto insurance profitability in more detail. The second quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 108.3% was 0.4 points higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and increased current report year accident frequency and severity, which were largely offset by higher earned premium, expense reductions, and lower adverse non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates. We continue to raise rates, reduce expenses, restrict growth, and enhanced claim processes as part of our comprehensive plan to improve auto insurance margins. This slide depicts the impact of our profit improvement actions on underlying auto insurance profitability trends. As a reminder, we continually assess claim severities as the year progresses. And last year, as 2022 developed, we continue to increase report year ultimate severity expectations. The chart on the left shows the quarterly underlying combined ratios from 2022 through the current quarter with 2022 quarters adjusted to account for full year average severity assumptions, which removes the effect that intra-year severity changes had on recorded quarterly results. After adjusting for the timing of higher severity expectations, the quarterly underlying combined ratio trend was essentially flat throughout 2022. As we move into 2023, the underlying combined ratio has improved modestly in each of the first two quarters, reflecting both the impact of our profitability actions and the continued persistently high levels of loss cost inflation. The chart on the right depicts the percent change at annualized average earned premium shown by the blue line and the average underlying loss and expense per policy shown by the light blue bars compared to prior year-end. Rapid increases in claim severity and higher accident frequency since mid-2021, resulted in significant increases in the underlying loss and expense per policy which outpaced the change in average earned premium and drove a higher underlying combined ratio in both 2021 and 2022. As we've implemented rate increases, the annualized earned premium trend line continues to increase and has begun to outpace the still elevated underlying cost per policy in the first two quarters of 2023, resulting in a modest improvement in the underlying combined ratio. Slide six provides an update on the execution of our comprehensive approach to increase returns in auto insurance. There are four areas of focus; raising rates, reducing expenses, implementing underwriting actions, and enhancing claim practices to manage loss costs. Starting with rates, you remember the Allstate brand implemented 16.9% of rate in 2022. In the first six months of 2023, we have implemented an additional 7.5% across the book, including 5.8% in the second quarter. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022, an additional 5.5% through the first six months of 2023. We will continue to pursue rate increases in 2023 to restore auto insurance margins back to the mid-90s target levels. Reducing operating expenses is core to transformative growth, and we also temporarily reduced advertising to reflect the lower appetite for new business. We continue to have more restrictive underwriting actions on new business in locations and risk segments where we have not yet achieved adequate prices for the risk, but are beginning to selectively remove these restrictions in states and segments that are achieving target margins. To this point, the number of states achieving an underlying combined ratio better than 100 increased from 23 states, which represented just under 30% of Allstate brand auto insurance premium at the end of 2022 and to 36 states, representing approximately 50% of premium at the end of the second quarter. Ensuring that our claim practices are operating effectively and enhancing those practices where necessary, is key to delivering customer value, particularly in this high inflation environment. This includes modifying claim processes in both physical damage and injury coverages by doing things like increasing resources, expanding reinspections and accelerating the settlement of injury claims to mitigate the risk of continued loss development. We are also negotiating improved vendor service and parts agreements to offset some of the inflation associated with repairing vehicles. Slide 7 provides an update on progress in three large states with a disproportionate impact on profitability. The table on the left provides rate increases either implemented so far this year are currently pending with the respective insurance department in California, New York and New Jersey. Because our current prices are not adequate to cover our costs in these states, we have had to take actions to restrict new business volumes. As a result, new issued applications from the combination of California, New York and New Jersey declined by approximately 62% compared to the prior year quarter. In California, we implemented a second 6.9% rate increase in April and also filed for a 35% increase in the second quarter that is currently pending with the Department of Insurance. We continue to work closely with the California Department to secure approval of this filing and restore auto rates to an adequate level. In New York, we implemented approximately three points of weighted rate in June, driven by approved increases in two closed companies. And subsequently received approval for a 6.7% increase in the larger open companies, which was implemented in July, we will continue to make further filings in 2023 that will be additive to their -- to the rates approved so far this year. In New Jersey, we received approval for a 6.9% rate increase in the first quarter and filed a subsequent 29% increase in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we anticipate implementing additional rate increases for the balance of 2023 to counteract persistent loss cost increases. Slide 8 dives deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. The chart on the left shows the property liability underwriting expense ratio and highlights drivers of the 2.5 point improvement in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first green bar shows the 1.4 point impact from advertising spend, which has been temporarily reduced, given a more limited appetite for new business. The second green bar shows the decline in operating costs, mainly driven by lower agent and employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums relative to fixed costs. Shifting to our longer-term trend on the right, we remain committed to reducing the adjusted expense ratio as part of transformative growth. This metric starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate. Through innovation and strong execution, we've driven significant improvement with a second quarter adjusted expense ratio of 24.7%. We expect to drive additional improvement, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024, which represents a 6-point reduction compared to our starting point in 2018. While increasing average premiums certainly represent a tailwind, our intent in establishing the goal is to become more price competitive. This requires a sustainable improvement in our cost structure with our future focus on three primary areas, including enhancing digitization and automation capabilities, improving operating efficiency through outsourcing, business model rationalization and centralized support and enabling higher growth distribution at lower cost through changes in agency compensation structure and new agent models. Now, let's move to slide 9 to review homeowner insurance results, which despite improving underlying performance, incurred an underwriting loss in the quarter driven by elevated catastrophe losses. Our business model incorporates a differentiated product, underwriting, reinsurance and claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. Our approach has consistently generated industry-leading underwriting results despite quarterly or yearly fluctuations in catastrophe losses. Our homeowners insurance combined ratio, including the impact of catastrophes, has outperformed the industry by 12 points from 2017 through 2022. During that same time period, we generated annual average underwriting income of approximately $650 million. The chart on the left shows key Allstate Protection homeowners insurance operating statistics for the quarter. Net written premium increased 12.4% from the prior year quarter, predominantly driven by higher average gross premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 1% increase in policies in force. Allstate brand average gross written premium per policy increased by 13.2% compared to the prior year quarter driven by implemented rate increases throughout 2022 and an additional 7.4 points implemented through the first six months of 2023 as well as inflation in insured home replacement costs. While the second quarter homeowners combined ratio is typically higher than full year results, primarily due to seasonally high severe weather-related catastrophe losses, the second quarter of 2023 combined ratio of 145.3% was among the highest in Allstate's history and increased by 37.8 points compared to last year's second quarter due to a 40.3 point increase in the catastrophe loss ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 67.6% improved by 1.9 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium, lower frequency and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher severity. The chart on the right provides a historical perspective on the second quarter property liability catastrophe loss ratio of 75.9 points, which was elevated compared to historical experience, reflecting an increased number of catastrophe events and larger losses per event. While the second quarter result was 33.9 points above the 15-year second quarter average of 42 points, it is not unprecedented and filled within modeled outcomes contemplated in our economic capital framework. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the homeowners business and continue to respond to loss trends by implementing rate increases to address higher repair costs and limiting exposures in geographies where we cannot achieve adequate returns for our shareholders. And now I'll hand it over to Jesse to discuss the remainder of our results.\nJesse Merten: Thank you, Mario. I'd like to start on Slide 10, which covers results for our Protection Services and Health and Benefits businesses. The chart on the left shows Protection Services where we continue to broaden the protection provided to an increasing number of customers largely through embedded distribution programs. Revenues in these businesses, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives increased 9.1% to $686 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Increase reflects growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Dealer Services, partially offset by a decline in parity. By leveraging the Allstate brand, excellent customer service and expanded products and partnerships with leading retailers, Allstate Protection Plans continues to generate profitable growth, resulting in an 18% increase in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. In the table below the chart, you will see that adjusted net income of $41 million in the second quarter decreased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher appliance and furniture claims severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. We'll continue to invest in these businesses, which provide an attractive opportunity to broaden distribution protection offerings that meet customers' needs and create value for shareholders. Shifting to the chart on the right, Health and Benefits continues to provide stable revenues while protecting more than four million policyholders. Revenues of $575 million in the second quarter of 2023 increased by $2 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in premiums, contract charges and other revenues in group health, which was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employer voluntary benefits. Health and Benefits continues to make progress on rebuilding core operating systems to drive down costs, improve the customer experience and support growth that generates shareholder value. Adjusted net income of $57 million in the second quarter of 2023 decreased $10 million, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the decline in employer voluntary benefits, individual health and higher expenses related to system investments. Now let's move to Slide 11 to discuss investment results and portfolio positioning. Active portfolio management includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, enterprise risk and return and capital, as well as interest rates and credit spreads by rating, sector and individual name. As you'll recall, last year, exposure to below investment grade bonds in public equity was reduced. We maintained this portfolio allocation in the second quarter, which enabled us to extend duration of the fixed income portfolio and increased market-based income levels. As shown in the chart on the left, net investment income totaled $610 million in the quarter, which was $48 million above the second quarter of last year. Market-based income of $536 million, shown in blue was $168 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration and higher yielding assets that sustainably increased income. Market-based income has also benefited from higher yields for short-term investments in floating rate assets, such as bank loans. Performance-based income of $127 million shown in black, was $109 million below the prior year quarter due to lower valuation increases and fewer sales of underlying assets. Our performance-based portfolio is expected to enhance long-term returns and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter as expected. The chart on the right shows the fixed income earned yield continues to rise and was 3.6% at quarter end compared to 2.8% for the prior year quarter and 3.4% in the first quarter of 2023. This chart also shows that from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, lowering fixed income duration mitigated losses as rates rose. Beginning in Q4 of 2022, we began to extend duration, which locks in higher yields for longer. In the second quarter, we further extended duration to 4.4 years, increasing from 4 years in the first quarter. Our fixed income portfolio yield is still below the current intermediate corporate bond yield of approximately 5.5%, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields. To close, I'd like to turn to Slide 12 to discuss how Allstate proactively manages capital to provide the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to navigate the challenging operating environment. Capital management is based on a sophisticated framework that quantifies capital targets by business, product, geography, investment type and for the overall enterprise. Targets include a base level of capital for expected volatility and earnings as well as additional capital for stress events, situations where correlations between risks are higher than modeled and other contingencies. This model enables us to proactively manage capital in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Utilization of reinsurance, both by event and in aggregate is assessed relative to overall enterprise risk levels. A robust reinsurance program is in place with multiyear contracts to mitigate losses from large catastrophes. Homeowners insurance geographic exposures are managed to generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns, including lowering exposure to California and Florida property markets. This framework was used to decide to purchase additional aggregate program coverage this year. Reducing high-yield bonds and public equities in the investment portfolio significantly reduced the amount of enterprise capital required for investments. This decision was based on market conditions and the decline in auto profitability as well as the desire to reduce volatility and statutory results. It also provides a sustainable source of increased income in capital generation. The decline in auto insurance profitability is also captured by our framework, which increased capital requirements for auto insurance from pre-pandemic levels to reflect recent results. The capital management framework ensures Allstate has the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to operate in challenging environments and be positioned for growth. Allstate's capital position is sound with estimated statutory surplus and holding company assets totaling $16.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, as shown on the table to the left. Holding company assets of $3.3 billion represent approximately 2.5x our annual fixed charges with no debt maturities for the remainder of 2023 and a modest amount maturing in 2024. Senior debt and preferred stock refinancing in the first and second quarters of this year demonstrate our ability to readily access capital markets to address maturities as they arise. In response to the loss this quarter, we have suspended share repurchases under the $5 billion authorization, which is 90% complete. This authorization expires in March of 2024. In addition to having a strong capital base, Allstate has a history of generating capital and statutory net income in our largest underwriting company, Allstate Insurance Company, as you can see on the chart on the right. Statutory net income averaged $1.9 billion annually in the 10 years prior to the onset of COVID. You can also see the impact of the rapid increase in auto insurance claim severity and recent catastrophe loss experience on 2022 and 2023 statutory net income. We're confident that the auto insurance profit improvement plan will restore profitability. The homeowner's insurance business is designed to generate underwriting profits, and proactive investment management will create additional capital to grow market share, expand protection offerings and provide cash return to shareholders. Allstate will continue to proactively manage capital to navigate the current operating environment and be well positioned for growth to increase its shareholder value. With that as context, let's open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Certainly, one moment for our first question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please.\nGregory Peters: Well, good morning, everyone. I guess, I'm going to focus on auto insurance profitability for my first question. And obviously, there's a bunch of slides in your presentation, the one where you identified the three states. I guess from a bigger picture perspective, though, -- do you have updated views on frequency and severity for the second half of this year or for next year versus what you were thinking at the beginning of the year I guess what I'm ultimately getting is how much more rate do we need to get that underlying combined ratio number that you use on the slide 6 -- excuse me, slide 5 to get it down to the low to mid-90s.\nTom Wilson: Greg, this is Tom. Let me start, and then Mario can jump in. First, as it relates to frequency and severity, of course, it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the second half of the year. What we do know is that the severity was increased in the second -- first half of this year from what we thought it would be when we looked at it last year. So we're really glad we took the rates that we did, and we've been accelerating rates, as Mario talked about. I think when you look at it, it's really -- of course, it's hard to predict, right? What you're really looking at is that slide that Mario showed that had the line with the average premiums going up and then the bar with the severities and you want that line to be above the bar, of course. What you know going forward is that the line is going to keep going up, right? Like we filed those rates, we've got those rates. We put them in the computer, we're collecting the cash. And so you know that's going to happen. What you don't know is whether severity will go up from the 11% or whether it will be down from the 11%. It's come down this year from last year. We'd like to think that all the work we're doing will have it come down even further. And so that gap will get you back to the mid-90s that we talked about in terms of targeted combined ratio. When that exactly happens, of course, is dependent on what happens to the second bar, which is not known. What we do know is we'll continue to take increased rates and make that line continue to go up. Mario, any specifics you want to add on the three states that you mentioned or?\nMario Rizzo: I think, Greg, the thing I'd add is less about to Tom's point, what we expect going forward and more about what we're seeing and maybe just give you a little more color underneath the loss cost trend. So as you remember, last quarter, we started giving you pure premium trends as opposed to coverage specific frequency and severity because we just think it's a better way for you to evaluate where overall profitability is going. And the point I'd make is if you look on Slide 5, as Tom pointed out, for the first couple of quarters this year, we've seen the average earned premium trend begin to outpace the increases in loss and expense. It's hard to predict what the future will hold, but that's an encouraging development. Underneath that loss trend, if you look at where we're at in the second quarter compared to where we were for the full year last year, the increase in pure premium is about 12.5%, and we told you that severity is up on average across all coverages by about 11%. So what we're seeing still is persistently high severity across coverages with a lesser impact from overall frequency increases. The point being we're going to continue to aggressively implement our profit improvement plan, you've seen what we've done with rates. We've done 7.5 points through the first half of this year in the Allstate brand, 5.5 points on National General. We're going to continue to do that. You see the benefit that the cost reductions is having on the combined ratio while that rate earns in. And we've talked a lot about those three states, which make up about one-quarter of our book, California, New York and New Jersey. We want to keep pushing on continuing to drive rate increases into the book. We've gotten some approvals so far this year, but there's rates pending, pretty significant rates pending in California and New Jersey, and we're prepared to file another rate in New York. So we're going to keep pushing really hard on that. And in the meantime, we've scaled way back on new business production in those states. And while it's having a reasonably small impact on the loss ratio so far this year, because new business just tends to be a smaller proportion of our overall book, it will continue to have a favorable impact on our loss ratio going forward. And until we get to adequate rates in those three states, we're going to keep restricting the volume of business we're willing to write.\nGregory Peters: Okay. Thanks for the color. Maybe just keeping on auto as my follow-up question on NatGen, you spoke about the reserve strengthening in the quarter, and I guess you also mentioned Florida in your comments. Can you give us any perspective on the reserve strengthening that happened inside NatGen? Is it a true-up and that you're comfortable where the trends are with matching reserves at this point in time, or is this going to be another situation where we have a couple of quarters of catch-up that we're having to deal with?\nTom Wilson: Mario can answer how we feel about the growth and the profitability of the growth in National General, Greg, let me just settle up context. So first, the acquisition of National General is exceeding our expectations. As, you know, we bought the company so that we could consolidate our Encompass business into it that would reduce the cost and create a stronger business that we're serving independent agents. We like what we got there. The consolidation and the cost reductions are exceeding our expectations. And that was the basis under which we agreed to where the economics of the acquisition made at. The upside from there was growing in the IA channel, both through the specialty vehicle product and by building new products for preferred auto and homeowners insurance using Allstate's expertise, both of which are also becoming reality. Mario, do you want to talk about, I guess, both reserves. But I think Greg's underlying question there was like you're growing, is that a good thing?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. So, Greg, the place I'd start with National General, you're right. We're growing in National General that's principally in the specialty vehicle or the non-standard auto part of the business, which that market continues to experience pretty significant disruption. A couple of things I'd say on NatGen. First of all, the underlying combined ratio in the quarter was 96%, and 96% is slightly higher than we want to run it at, but it's pretty close to our target margin. And that 96% includes the kind of roll-forward impact of increasing reserves principally in the 2022 accident year and therefore, increasing our loss expectations in the 2023 year. So, that's all embedded in the 96%. A couple of things in addition to that, that I mentioned. We've talked a lot about the profit improvement plan, we're implementing that same approach in that same plan in National General across the same levers we're using in the Allstate brand. We've taken 5.5 points of rate this year, 11 points of rate over the last 12 months in NatGen. And given that it's predominantly a non-standard auto book, the book tends to turn over and get repriced pretty rapidly. So, we're comfortable that the rate we've taken so far this year is working its way into the system. And I would say in response to a higher loss trend that we've seen in 2023, we've accelerated our plan to take rate in 2023. So, we're ahead of that 5.5 points is ahead of where we expected to be at this point during the year. We've also restricted underwriting guidelines in a number of states, we're writing more liability-only less full coverage. So, we're being really selective about what we're writing. And the other benefit, as Tom mentioned, part of the rationale around acquiring National General was the opportunity to lower costs and improve the expense ratio, and we're benefiting from that inside that 96% underlying combined ratio. We've seen a pretty significant improvement year-over-year in the underwriting expense ratio as we essentially take advantage of scale through the growth we're getting. So, comfortable where we're positioned. We're taking the appropriate actions from a profitability perspective. And so we're comfortable with what we're writing in NatGen right now.\nGregory Peters: Got it. Thank you for the detail and your answers.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question please.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you very much for taking my question. Yes. Tom, there's the amount of rate that you need and the amount that you can get over a certain period of time, but when you look back to the beginning of the year and you had your plan for taking rates and you've learned about some changes in frequency and severity over the past six, seven months. Has that changed the perspective on how much rate you need and want to ask for? And does that change the 2023 plan, or does that mean that the regulators will give you only so much and you have get that rate in 2024 and beyond?\nTom Wilson: Of course, it's -- I would say, Josh, it's a good question, but I would say it's not like not like every quarter or every 6 months, we adapt it is like every day. So Mario and Guy are constantly looking at our pricing, and we're going to maximum file rates everywhere we can, and we're not getting as much pushback from goes because the numbers are pretty clear. Like it's not like we're making it up, you pay for the cars and they see the cash go out so you -- and they do have to pay attention to what the rules are in the rating. Now we have 3 states, which are a problem, and we're working aggressively with them. so that we can get the right amount of it. But yes, so our -- the rate expectation for the year has gone up from the beginning of the year. And it will keep going up until we get to our target combined ratio. We have -- we've talked about some of the issues we have in some of those states, you see us agreeing to lower amounts than we actually need because the time value of money and the multiplication works for you. So why take a 6.9 when you need 35 in California because you can get 6.9 right away as opposed you could wait 18 months to get 35. So we've we're very sophisticated and have good relationships with them, so we can manage it so that it meets our needs. So and we'll just keep rate that's on auto, which I assume where you're going, Josh. Same thing applies in homeowners and our price increases are up a little bit, but not up as much as what we thought they were going to be. but they're still from where we set out where we thought would be in the beginning. Mario, add anything you would add?\nA \u2013 Mario Rizzo: Yes. Just a couple of additional data points, Josh. As Tom mentioned, our data is immediately -- our indications are immediately responsive to the data we're seeing. So we're constantly updating rate indications and filing for what we need based on what we're actually experiencing versus what we thought we would have needed going into the year. And the other point I'd make is, and this is on a couple of the states that we've spiked out for you. We're evaluating trade-offs and leaning in where we think it just makes sense. So for example, in California, got the 2 6.9% rate and we turned around and filed for essentially our full indication at 35, knowing that, that was likely to require a longer review period. There was a little more risk there, but we thought it was the right thing to do. In New Jersey, we did the same thing. We got the 6.9% rate approved, which is essentially the cap that the state hold you to, but then we opted to utilize an administrative provision and file for a 29% rate. So again, we're aggressively pushing on the amount of rate we need based on the loss experience where we've got in real time. And we're going to keep doing that. and keep pushing rate through and working with all the departments and each of the regulators to get those rates approved as quickly as we can to continue to bend the line on that loss trend.\nQ \u2013 Joshua Shanker: And outside of the 3 problem states, when you are submitting the filing, does the filing need to be audit financial statements or financial data in arrears, or can you pretty much file new rate with current data as it's coming into the systems?\nA \u2013 Mario Rizzo: Yes. I mean for filing used state, certainly, we're filing based on current data as opposed to relying on prior year-end or any of that information. So what we're doing is, Josh, is reacting to the loss trends we're seeing incorporating that into the filing, and that's what kept submitted.\nJosh Shanker: Okay. Thank you for the answers to the question.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nElyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, I wanted to go back to the capital discussion and the decision you guys made to pull the buyback program. Can you just give us a sense of what you're looking for when you return to buybacks? I sense maybe some of this is also dependent going into wind season, right, which could bring additional cat losses to Allstate and you guys are still working on improving the profitability of your auto business. So what would you need to see to turn back on the buyback at some point next year?\nTom Wilson : Elyse, let me start macro and then ask Jesse to maybe dig in even a little more. I know you spend a lot of time on capital, so we can help you show you what we believe to be true. First, we have a long history of proactive managing capital, whether that's how we deploy it at the individual risk level or what we do with different investments, as Jesse talked about, whether it's selling businesses like life and annuities or using alternative capital like reinsurance or cat bonds or providing cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you point out, I think if you look at the Q, we bought back about $37 billion of stock since we went public. And so that's because we're -- we got good math, which Jesse will talk about, and we do a proactively. I think the suspending the share repurchase we just sound judgment. If you're not making money, don't buy shares back. It's really not a lot more complicated than that. I mean, it obviously helps you preserve capital, but just sort of good logic always serves the right kind of capital plan, which is you got to make money to be buying shares back. Jesse, do you want to talk about maybe give at least some more specifics on this whole capital?\nJesse Merten : Yes. Good morning, Elyse. I think to build on Tom's point, and I think it's easiest to just think about not the specific question, but more how we think about capital management more broadly. So you focus as many others do on RBC. RBC is a great measure for insurance companies, it's common. We look at it as well. So we certainly understand why there's a focus at times on RBC. It's a measure that served the industry well in good times and in bad times. But I think as you know, RBC has some limitations. So we use it as an input in our capital management process, but not a primary driver, right? RBC is focused on statutory legal entities, but it doesn't incorporate the risk across the enterprise or correlation in those types of risks. It doesn't include sources of capital outside of regulated entities. Protection plans would be an example there. But those aspects are important to our overall capital management framework.\neyes: Now that capital is all available to us and our comprehensive and more precise capital management framework considers those facets. So -- and I think it's important to go back to really how we're managing capital through what we consider to be a very detailed and sophisticated economic capital framework that quantifies enterprise risk and establishes our targets. As we've talked, that includes inputs from regulatory capital models, rating agencies and then our own risk models to help to quantify stress events, and we built those models really off of their risk models that are used to regulate banks. We feel very good about the output of our overall economic capital model. So we use that then as we've discussed, to determine a level of base capital that we need to operate our business while continuing to meet customer needs and amounts that are well above triggering any regulatory involvement. So you've got base capital. On top of that, we hold stress capital for unexpected on frequent outcomes. And then we have a contingent reserve that we use and included in our target capital range, that's really meant to incorporate extreme stress events, extreme low frequency events and just basically things that are beyond the standard probabilities that we apply to our stressed capital calculations. So high catastrophes this quarter used some of the contingent capital reserve, but we continue to hold stress capital that's above our base capital level, and we remain confident in our capital position and our ability to execute on strategy, we look ahead. I think your question gets to the future, right? So I wanted to build a base for reminding everyone how we think about it. But as we look to the future, it's more than just a question of the buybacks, it's what is their capital perspective look like. And we continue to believe we're well capitalized even if it takes longer than we expect to get auto profitability back to targeted levels and even if catastrophes come in at more expected levels, for the rest of the year in 2023. Even at more normal levels of catastrophes for the rest of the year, 2023 will be the highest year for catastrophe losses on a pure dollar basis in about 25 years. So it's a high cap quarter. We continue to feel good about capital, liquidity is not an issue, as we've talked about. We have a strong source of cash through interest payments and maturities that come over the next 12 months, and we have about $5 billion that comes off the portfolio that selling everything in the next 12 months, and we have a highly liquid investment portfolio. We also have a number of capital options that we're continuously evaluating given our proactive approach to capital management, as Tom mentioned. So that includes additional reinsurance options that could allow us to lower the volatility of our earnings at an attractive cost of capital, and we continue to look at those things. I think we've also proven in the last couple of quarters, we have open access to financial markets where we showed that through our -- some of our refinancing activity. So we have a lot of options. I want to kind of close out with -- as it relates to capital options and capital strength, issuing common stock at this point is not something that we're considering. It's not an option that's on the table given how we feel about our overall capital position. So maybe that -- I know it's more than just when you're going to turn back on buybacks. But I want to -- I think the context around how we think about capital management is more important to how we might answer that question in the future. So hopefully, that was helpful.\nElyse Greenspan: That was helpful. And then maybe just one more, right? You did mention reinsurance and some other options that you have. And you did make -- you did in the first quarter, right, you choose to monetize part of your equity portfolio. Is it safe to assume that you think about prospect going forward on the capital side, you're not looking to make any significant changes to investments? And on the same thinking about your current businesses, you're not -- you wouldn't be thinking about monetizing any assets as a way to free up capital?\nTom Wilson: Elyse, so on the investment side, that decision was primarily made from a risk and return standpoint, first starting at the markets. And we thought -- when we made the decision, we thought there is greater opportunity to make money by lengthening duration than by staying in equities. It had the benefit of reducing the volatility of equities. And in our models, the capital charges for equities is a lot higher the bot. So it has that capital benefit. If we felt like the time was right to go back long in public equities, then we would look at it at the time and then we'd say, okay, how much capital do we have and how do we feel about it? But we don't have a date in mind for that. I think when you just look at the economic environment, it's somewhat balanced.\nJesse Merten: And I think as it relates to monetizing assets, Elyse, in that component of the question. I think we certainly understand all the range of options but we don't believe we're in a position right now where we have to be considering things like monetizing assets to bolster capital. Again, we feel good about our capital position. We have options in place, and we understand the full range of options of what we could do in the event we believe that we had a need.\nTom Wilson: We have the capital to make our strategy is, of course, the way we're going to increase shareholder value. One, get profit up. Two, get growth up. And three, broaden the portfolio, which those lands to will lead to a higher multiple, and that's what we're trying to drive to.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks for all the color.\nOperator: Thank you, one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from BMO. Your question, please.\nMichael Zaremski: I guess, my first is a quick follow-up on the capital discussion, you said bolstering capital. So I just want to clarify, you reiterated the 14% to 17% ROE targets, which I believe you've been talking about since I believe 2019 could be prior looking at my notes. It seems like there's a disconnect, though, because the shareholders' equity levels ex OCI are down meaningfully since 2019. There's an element of where -- it seems like this is why this company is coming up, investors are expecting that the consensus ROEs look like they're well above the 14% to 17% because people aren't bolstering their capital assumptions, I guess, in the model. So I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. It's 14% to 17% is still the target. And so we directionally should be making sure we don't turn on the buyback until Cereal's equity levels are bolstered a bit.\nTom Wilson: So first, the 14% to 17% confirmation was just really our way saying we don't see anything that diminishes the ultimate earning power of the company. What the equity base is and what the earnings are, of course, but we -- so we're really just trying to say we don't see anything that diminishes the earning power of the building company. We never said it was a cap. And as I just mentioned, our strategy is really get returns up to where they've been historically, which will increase shareholder value. And then the big differential we have versus progressive and others is we need higher growth to drive the multiple of and we're going to get that two ways to increase market share, personal profit liability to transformative growth. And then secondly, by expanding our protection offerings, which will drive the multiple up. So it's like step 1, step 2. We think they can both hit at the same time, to be honest, but that's what we're driving to.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's okay. That's very helpful. My last question is just thinking through all the actions you're taking in terms of expense ratio, pulling back in certain states. I guess it seems clear that in the near term, we should be thinking about PIF [ph] growth remaining under pressure. I'm just curious, too, is that one the right way to think about it? And two, is there -- for your capital model, does PIF growth being negative with total revenue growth still being very positive because of pricing power? Is it -- does it help that you're shrinking PIF, but growing top line because of pricing, or is every dollar of growth still seems the revenue still seem the same way within your capital model?\nTom Wilscon: Capital models are really driven on risk, which are tied to premium. So PIF doesn't really impact it. So -- which is the right economically, we believe the right way to do it. In terms of growth, we think we can -- Mario talked about growth in National General. We talked about growth in 50% of the markets were working there. When those 3 states that we need higher prices on get to the right level, we can grow there as we continue to roll out transformative growth and we'll be in -- we expect to be in 10 states with our new product this year, which will just be in the states and that we drive a lot of growth. but we're using machine-based learning some really cool direct stuff. So we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow. And so we're not concerned about it. The reason we're reducing the growth in those states like if you're not making any money, it doesn't make sense to sell it. Like I don't really understand the logic of we're losing money. Let's go out and spend a bunch of money to get business, and we'll continue to lose money until we can raise the prices later. That just raises your -- if you include those losses in your acquisition cost, it's hard to make the lifetime value work. So we chose not to write the business it's not quite really, as Mario said, it's not really a combined ratio impact. It's just like why do something that's uneconomic.\nMichael Zaremski: Understood\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your questions please.\nAlex Scott: Hi. First one I had is on the prior year development. One of the things we noticed from last quarter was just that I think 2022 accident year actually looked like it developed favorably and 2021 was still a bit unfavorable. And I guess I'm just interested what was the mix of that this quarter? And how do we think about sort of the speed up of kind of reaching settlements to reduce volatility on some of the older claims and the impact that's having? And where are you in the process of doing that? Like is there still a good amount of wood to chop there? Have you sort of, gone through the 2021 claims to the extent you're going to do it already. Just any color around all that to help us think through what development could look like through the rest of the year?\nA \u2013 Jesse Merten: And I'll take that quickly. I think the first thing I would highlight is that the development this quarter was related to National General, so a little bit different than what we went through last year. And we don't separately disclose which prior years, it's attributable to. But it's safe to say -- given the nature of that business, some of the near and years, we continually, Alex, move reserves between years and coverages and prior year reserves and coming up with these estimates. And so it's safe to say that we're really focused on settling -- getting some of those older claims settled, getting the reserves right. And, sort of, again, I'm a broken record on this, but getting the aggregate reserve recorded properly. So this was really -- again, this was -- this quarter is certainly a story of the National General reserve levels. And the movement between prior years and coverage is just normal course this quarter.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Thanks. And the second one I had is just a follow-up on, there was a comment earlier related to, I think it was the 35% filing where it was mentioned that, that can take up to 18 months. I mean that one, I think, was filed in late May. So that would suggest would be like all the way towards the end of 2024, if I just take that comment at face value as to like when you potentially get the California approval. I'm just trying to weigh thinking through that versus some of the comments that suggested the regulatory environment may be getting a little better, I mean that seems like a pretty long time line. Can you help us think through and maybe I'm just trying to take that a little to cut and dry?\nTom Wilson: I think I'm probably the one that said 18 months that was not to imply that we think it's right to wait 18 months or it should take 18 months. We just said sometimes it takes a long time, the California department stayed on all rate increases for a couple of years. They're not in that mode anymore, and we're working actively with them because they know that's not a good place to be and it doesn't create a good market. So I think what you can do is just look at the monthly numbers we've put out on rate increases. You can factor that in. You can -- we've given some math on how it rolls into the P&L. And that will give you a good look 12 months forward at what that blue line is that Mario talked about and at what rate is going up. They will tell you what's going to come in. And then you can make your own judgment on what you think severity and frequency will be.\nAlex Scott: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for clarifying.\nBrent Vandermause: Hey, Jonathan, we\u2019ll take one more question.\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our final question then. And our final question for today comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for first allowing me in here. I want to go back to the capital question and the decision to stop the buybacks, if I may. And Tom, I'm certainly -- I appreciate the thought of it doesn't really make sense to buy back stock when we're generating a loss. That said, I think we have seen about $2 billion of buybacks since I think, the second quarter of last year in a loss environment. I think everything you're showing on -- and presenting in the slides would suggest that we are hopefully inflecting in the auto margins. I think even a quarter ago, you were still talking about over $4 billion of holdco liquidity. So I'd just love to better understand what changed or shifted in the thinking here to make you decide to stop here, especially when stock seems to be attractively valued relative to previous buybacks?\nTom Wilson: Let me go back to the genesis of the buyback program and then roll it forward. So it was a $5 billion program, about $3 billion of which was because we're returning capital that was generated by sale of the life and annuity businesses. So it was really a $2 billion net program. We tended to have that program -- that buyback program was usually sized by how much money we made the prior year and we weren't using in growth. So it was in arrears kind of share repurchase program. And that's how we got to $5 billion. So we're 90% of the way there on $5 billon, we couldn't complete it, for sure, and we just decided you're losing money, don't buy stock back. It's just sometimes good capital management is just a common sense as opposed to a specific formula because it's formulas change, correlations change and all that sort of stuff. So from our standpoint, it was really no more complicated. I mean, Jess and I talked for like five minutes were like, okay, another quarter of a loss. A lot of -- lot catastrophes are a lot higher, almost two standard deviations away. We factored that in when we decided on the $5 billion. We factored that in when we looked at last year, keeping the program going. And it was a sensitivity, but it was a sensitivity, not a reality when insurance into a reality, you say, okay, let's just stop buying it back. And if we feel like getting back to it, we will. And we have a strong track record of buying stock back, but what will drive the value of our stock, and I can close on this is not share repurchases. Like we've looked at share repurchases. As I said, we bought $37 billion back. The return on share repurchases, if you take the price that you bought it at and the price of the stock at any point in time. Of course, it varies like it's cheap now, in my opinion. And so it would be good to buyback. But when you look at it over an extended period of time, it kind of turns into the cost of capital, which makes some sense. Sometimes you get a 20% return because you buyback cheap and the stock went on to run. Sometimes you buy it and it stacks up and you get lower return. But when you look at it over a long period of time, so you don't really create shareholder value by doing share buybacks. If you don't do share buybacks, you destroy shareholder value. That's a bad thing. But -- so the way we're going to create shareholder value is get profitability up, execute transformer growth and broaden our -- the product offering to people and things like protection plans, which are low capital, high growth, high-return businesses, health and benefits in the same way. So that's our plan. We look -- thank you for tuning in this quarter, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jesse Merten",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario. I'd like to start on Slide 10, which covers results for our Protection Services and Health and Benefits businesses. The chart on the left shows Protection Services where we continue to broaden the protection provided to an increasing number of customers largely through embedded distribution programs. Revenues in these businesses, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives increased 9.1% to $686 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Increase reflects growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Dealer Services, partially offset by a decline in parity. By leveraging the Allstate brand, excellent customer service and expanded products and partnerships with leading retailers, Allstate Protection Plans continues to generate profitable growth, resulting in an 18% increase in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. In the table below the chart, you will see that adjusted net income of $41 million in the second quarter decreased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher appliance and furniture claims severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. We'll continue to invest in these businesses, which provide an attractive opportunity to broaden distribution protection offerings that meet customers' needs and create value for shareholders. Shifting to the chart on the right, Health and Benefits continues to provide stable revenues while protecting more than four million policyholders. Revenues of $575 million in the second quarter of 2023 increased by $2 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in premiums, contract charges and other revenues in group health, which was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employer voluntary benefits. Health and Benefits continues to make progress on rebuilding core operating systems to drive down costs, improve the customer experience and support growth that generates shareholder value. Adjusted net income of $57 million in the second quarter of 2023 decreased $10 million, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the decline in employer voluntary benefits, individual health and higher expenses related to system investments. Now let's move to Slide 11 to discuss investment results and portfolio positioning. Active portfolio management includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, enterprise risk and return and capital, as well as interest rates and credit spreads by rating, sector and individual name. As you'll recall, last year, exposure to below investment grade bonds in public equity was reduced. We maintained this portfolio allocation in the second quarter, which enabled us to extend duration of the fixed income portfolio and increased market-based income levels. As shown in the chart on the left, net investment income totaled $610 million in the quarter, which was $48 million above the second quarter of last year. Market-based income of $536 million, shown in blue was $168 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration and higher yielding assets that sustainably increased income. Market-based income has also benefited from higher yields for short-term investments in floating rate assets, such as bank loans. Performance-based income of $127 million shown in black, was $109 million below the prior year quarter due to lower valuation increases and fewer sales of underlying assets. Our performance-based portfolio is expected to enhance long-term returns and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter as expected. The chart on the right shows the fixed income earned yield continues to rise and was 3.6% at quarter end compared to 2.8% for the prior year quarter and 3.4% in the first quarter of 2023. This chart also shows that from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, lowering fixed income duration mitigated losses as rates rose. Beginning in Q4 of 2022, we began to extend duration, which locks in higher yields for longer. In the second quarter, we further extended duration to 4.4 years, increasing from 4 years in the first quarter. Our fixed income portfolio yield is still below the current intermediate corporate bond yield of approximately 5.5%, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields. To close, I'd like to turn to Slide 12 to discuss how Allstate proactively manages capital to provide the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to navigate the challenging operating environment. Capital management is based on a sophisticated framework that quantifies capital targets by business, product, geography, investment type and for the overall enterprise. Targets include a base level of capital for expected volatility and earnings as well as additional capital for stress events, situations where correlations between risks are higher than modeled and other contingencies. This model enables us to proactively manage capital in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Utilization of reinsurance, both by event and in aggregate is assessed relative to overall enterprise risk levels. A robust reinsurance program is in place with multiyear contracts to mitigate losses from large catastrophes. Homeowners insurance geographic exposures are managed to generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns, including lowering exposure to California and Florida property markets. This framework was used to decide to purchase additional aggregate program coverage this year. Reducing high-yield bonds and public equities in the investment portfolio significantly reduced the amount of enterprise capital required for investments. This decision was based on market conditions and the decline in auto profitability as well as the desire to reduce volatility and statutory results. It also provides a sustainable source of increased income in capital generation. The decline in auto insurance profitability is also captured by our framework, which increased capital requirements for auto insurance from pre-pandemic levels to reflect recent results. The capital management framework ensures Allstate has the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to operate in challenging environments and be positioned for growth. Allstate's capital position is sound with estimated statutory surplus and holding company assets totaling $16.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, as shown on the table to the left. Holding company assets of $3.3 billion represent approximately 2.5x our annual fixed charges with no debt maturities for the remainder of 2023 and a modest amount maturing in 2024. Senior debt and preferred stock refinancing in the first and second quarters of this year demonstrate our ability to readily access capital markets to address maturities as they arise. In response to the loss this quarter, we have suspended share repurchases under the $5 billion authorization, which is 90% complete. This authorization expires in March of 2024. In addition to having a strong capital base, Allstate has a history of generating capital and statutory net income in our largest underwriting company, Allstate Insurance Company, as you can see on the chart on the right. Statutory net income averaged $1.9 billion annually in the 10 years prior to the onset of COVID. You can also see the impact of the rapid increase in auto insurance claim severity and recent catastrophe loss experience on 2022 and 2023 statutory net income. We're confident that the auto insurance profit improvement plan will restore profitability. The homeowner's insurance business is designed to generate underwriting profits, and proactive investment management will create additional capital to grow market share, expand protection offerings and provide cash return to shareholders. Allstate will continue to proactively manage capital to navigate the current operating environment and be well positioned for growth to increase its shareholder value. With that as context, let's open up the line for your questions. Yes. Good morning, Elyse. I think to build on Tom's point, and I think it's easiest to just think about not the specific question, but more how we think about capital management more broadly. So you focus as many others do on RBC. RBC is a great measure for insurance companies, it's common. We look at it as well. So we certainly understand why there's a focus at times on RBC. It's a measure that served the industry well in good times and in bad times. But I think as you know, RBC has some limitations. So we use it as an input in our capital management process, but not a primary driver, right? RBC is focused on statutory legal entities, but it doesn't incorporate the risk across the enterprise or correlation in those types of risks. It doesn't include sources of capital outside of regulated entities. Protection plans would be an example there. But those aspects are important to our overall capital management framework. And I think as it relates to monetizing assets, Elyse, in that component of the question. I think we certainly understand all the range of options but we don't believe we're in a position right now where we have to be considering things like monetizing assets to bolster capital. Again, we feel good about our capital position. We have options in place, and we understand the full range of options of what we could do in the event we believe that we had a need."

            "content": "Good morning. We appreciate you investing your time in Allstate. Let's start with an overview of results and then Mario and Jesse will walk through operating results and the actions being taken to increase shareholder value. Let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy has two components; increase personal profit liability market share, and expand protection services, which are shown in the two with on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see a summary of results for the second quarter. Progress is being made on the comprehensive plan to improve auto insurance profitability, which includes raising rates, reducing expenses, limiting growth and enhancing claim processes. While auto insurance margins are not at target levels, the proportion of premium associated with states operating and that underlying -- underwriting profit has gone from just under 30% in 2022 to 50% for the first half of this year. Mario will discuss the actions being taken to continue this trend and importantly, improved results in New York, New Jersey and California. Severe weather in the quarter contributed to a net loss of $1.4 billion, 42 catastrophe events impacted 160,000 customers and resulted in $2.7 billion of catastrophe losses and a property liability underwriting loss of $2.1 billion. Strong fixed income results from higher bond yields generated $610 million of investment income and Protection Services and Health and Benefits generated $98 million of profits in the quarter. The transformative growth plan to become the lowest cost protection provider is making continued progress. This both helps current results with lower costs and positions Allstate for sustainable growth when auto margins return to acceptable levels. Affordable, simple and connected property liability products with sophisticated telematics pricing and differentiated direct-to-consumer capabilities are being introduced under the Allstate brand through a new technology platform. National General was growing, which will also increase market share. Specialty auto expertise, along with leveraging auto's Allstate strength in preferred auto and homeowners insurance products are expected to drive sustainable growth. Allstate Protection Plans is expanding its embedded protection through new products and retail relationships and in international markets. Allstate has a strong capital position with $16.9 billion of statutory surplus and holding company assets, as Jesse will discuss later. And as you know, we have a long history of providing cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 3.9% of outstanding shares for $1.3 billion. We suspended this is repurchase program in July, as we had a net loss for the six months of the year. Improving profitability, increasing property liability, organic growth and broadening protection offered to customers through an extensive distribution platform will increase shareholder value. Let's review financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $14 billion in the second quarter increased 14.4% above the prior year quarter of $1.8 billion. The increase was driven by higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance from rates taken in 2022 and 2023, resulting in property-liability earned premium growth of 9.6%. Net investment income of $610 million reflects the impact of higher fixed income yields and extended duration, which will substantially increase income. This growth more than offset a decline from performance-based investments in the quarter. The net loss of $1.4 billion and an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion reflects a profit liability underwriting loss of $2.1 billion due to the $2.7 billion in catastrophe losses and increased auto insurance loss costs. In auto insurance, higher insurance pros and lower expenses were largely offset by higher catastrophe losses and increased claim frequency and severity. The underlying auto insurance combined ratio did improve slightly for the first six months of 2023 compared to the year-end 2022. Auto insurance had an underwriting loss of $678 million. In homeowners insurance, catastrophe losses were substantially over the 15-year average, resulting in a combined ratio of 145, generating an underwriting loss of $1.3 billion. The underlying combined ratio on homeowners improved 1.9 points to 67.6% as higher average premiums more than offset increased severity. Adjusted net income of $98 million from protection services and health and benefits when combined with the $610 million of investment income offset a portion of the underwriting loss. The target for enterprise adjusted net income return on equity remains at 14% to 17%. I'll now turn it over to Mario to discuss profit liability results. Greg, this is Tom. Let me start, and then Mario can jump in. First, as it relates to frequency and severity, of course, it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the second half of the year. What we do know is that the severity was increased in the second -- first half of this year from what we thought it would be when we looked at it last year. So we're really glad we took the rates that we did, and we've been accelerating rates, as Mario talked about. I think when you look at it, it's really -- of course, it's hard to predict, right? What you're really looking at is that slide that Mario showed that had the line with the average premiums going up and then the bar with the severities and you want that line to be above the bar, of course. What you know going forward is that the line is going to keep going up, right? Like we filed those rates, we've got those rates. We put them in the computer, we're collecting the cash. And so you know that's going to happen. What you don't know is whether severity will go up from the 11% or whether it will be down from the 11%. It's come down this year from last year. We'd like to think that all the work we're doing will have it come down even further. And so that gap will get you back to the mid-90s that we talked about in terms of targeted combined ratio. When that exactly happens, of course, is dependent on what happens to the second bar, which is not known. What we do know is we'll continue to take increased rates and make that line continue to go up. Mario, any specifics you want to add on the three states that you mentioned or? Mario can answer how we feel about the growth and the profitability of the growth in National General, Greg, let me just settle up context. So first, the acquisition of National General is exceeding our expectations. As, you know, we bought the company so that we could consolidate our Encompass business into it that would reduce the cost and create a stronger business that we're serving independent agents. We like what we got there. The consolidation and the cost reductions are exceeding our expectations. And that was the basis under which we agreed to where the economics of the acquisition made at. The upside from there was growing in the IA channel, both through the specialty vehicle product and by building new products for preferred auto and homeowners insurance using Allstate's expertise, both of which are also becoming reality. Mario, do you want to talk about, I guess, both reserves. But I think Greg's underlying question there was like you're growing, is that a good thing? Of course, it's -- I would say, Josh, it's a good question, but I would say it's not like not like every quarter or every 6 months, we adapt it is like every day. So Mario and Guy are constantly looking at our pricing, and we're going to maximum file rates everywhere we can, and we're not getting as much pushback from goes because the numbers are pretty clear. Like it's not like we're making it up, you pay for the cars and they see the cash go out so you -- and they do have to pay attention to what the rules are in the rating. Now we have 3 states, which are a problem, and we're working aggressively with them. so that we can get the right amount of it. But yes, so our -- the rate expectation for the year has gone up from the beginning of the year. And it will keep going up until we get to our target combined ratio. We have -- we've talked about some of the issues we have in some of those states, you see us agreeing to lower amounts than we actually need because the time value of money and the multiplication works for you. So why take a 6.9 when you need 35 in California because you can get 6.9 right away as opposed you could wait 18 months to get 35. So we've we're very sophisticated and have good relationships with them, so we can manage it so that it meets our needs. So and we'll just keep rate that's on auto, which I assume where you're going, Josh. Same thing applies in homeowners and our price increases are up a little bit, but not up as much as what we thought they were going to be. but they're still from where we set out where we thought would be in the beginning. Mario, add anything you would add?\nA \u2013 Mario Rizzo: Yes. Just a couple of additional data points, Josh. As Tom mentioned, our data is immediately -- our indications are immediately responsive to the data we're seeing. So we're constantly updating rate indications and filing for what we need based on what we're actually experiencing versus what we thought we would have needed going into the year. And the other point I'd make is, and this is on a couple of the states that we've spiked out for you. We're evaluating trade-offs and leaning in where we think it just makes sense. So for example, in California, got the 2 6.9% rate and we turned around and filed for essentially our full indication at 35, knowing that, that was likely to require a longer review period. There was a little more risk there, but we thought it was the right thing to do. In New Jersey, we did the same thing. We got the 6.9% rate approved, which is essentially the cap that the state hold you to, but then we opted to utilize an administrative provision and file for a 29% rate. So again, we're aggressively pushing on the amount of rate we need based on the loss experience where we've got in real time. And we're going to keep doing that. and keep pushing rate through and working with all the departments and each of the regulators to get those rates approved as quickly as we can to continue to bend the line on that loss trend.\nQ \u2013 Joshua Shanker: And outside of the 3 problem states, when you are submitting the filing, does the filing need to be audit financial statements or financial data in arrears, or can you pretty much file new rate with current data as it's coming into the systems?\nA \u2013 Mario Rizzo: Yes. I mean for filing used state, certainly, we're filing based on current data as opposed to relying on prior year-end or any of that information. So what we're doing is, Josh, is reacting to the loss trends we're seeing incorporating that into the filing, and that's what kept submitted. Elyse, let me start macro and then ask Jesse to maybe dig in even a little more. I know you spend a lot of time on capital, so we can help you show you what we believe to be true. First, we have a long history of proactive managing capital, whether that's how we deploy it at the individual risk level or what we do with different investments, as Jesse talked about, whether it's selling businesses like life and annuities or using alternative capital like reinsurance or cat bonds or providing cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you point out, I think if you look at the Q, we bought back about $37 billion of stock since we went public. And so that's because we're -- we got good math, which Jesse will talk about, and we do a proactively. I think the suspending the share repurchase we just sound judgment. If you're not making money, don't buy shares back. It's really not a lot more complicated than that. I mean, it obviously helps you preserve capital, but just sort of good logic always serves the right kind of capital plan, which is you got to make money to be buying shares back. Jesse, do you want to talk about maybe give at least some more specifics on this whole capital? Elyse, so on the investment side, that decision was primarily made from a risk and return standpoint, first starting at the markets. And we thought -- when we made the decision, we thought there is greater opportunity to make money by lengthening duration than by staying in equities. It had the benefit of reducing the volatility of equities. And in our models, the capital charges for equities is a lot higher the bot. So it has that capital benefit. If we felt like the time was right to go back long in public equities, then we would look at it at the time and then we'd say, okay, how much capital do we have and how do we feel about it? But we don't have a date in mind for that. I think when you just look at the economic environment, it's somewhat balanced. We have the capital to make our strategy is, of course, the way we're going to increase shareholder value. One, get profit up. Two, get growth up. And three, broaden the portfolio, which those lands to will lead to a higher multiple, and that's what we're trying to drive to. So first, the 14% to 17% confirmation was just really our way saying we don't see anything that diminishes the ultimate earning power of the company. What the equity base is and what the earnings are, of course, but we -- so we're really just trying to say we don't see anything that diminishes the earning power of the building company. We never said it was a cap. And as I just mentioned, our strategy is really get returns up to where they've been historically, which will increase shareholder value. And then the big differential we have versus progressive and others is we need higher growth to drive the multiple of and we're going to get that two ways to increase market share, personal profit liability to transformative growth. And then secondly, by expanding our protection offerings, which will drive the multiple up. So it's like step 1, step 2. We think they can both hit at the same time, to be honest, but that's what we're driving to. I think I'm probably the one that said 18 months that was not to imply that we think it's right to wait 18 months or it should take 18 months. We just said sometimes it takes a long time, the California department stayed on all rate increases for a couple of years. They're not in that mode anymore, and we're working actively with them because they know that's not a good place to be and it doesn't create a good market. So I think what you can do is just look at the monthly numbers we've put out on rate increases. You can factor that in. You can -- we've given some math on how it rolls into the P&L. And that will give you a good look 12 months forward at what that blue line is that Mario talked about and at what rate is going up. They will tell you what's going to come in. And then you can make your own judgment on what you think severity and frequency will be. Let me go back to the genesis of the buyback program and then roll it forward. So it was a $5 billion program, about $3 billion of which was because we're returning capital that was generated by sale of the life and annuity businesses. So it was really a $2 billion net program. We tended to have that program -- that buyback program was usually sized by how much money we made the prior year and we weren't using in growth. So it was in arrears kind of share repurchase program. And that's how we got to $5 billion. So we're 90% of the way there on $5 billon, we couldn't complete it, for sure, and we just decided you're losing money, don't buy stock back. It's just sometimes good capital management is just a common sense as opposed to a specific formula because it's formulas change, correlations change and all that sort of stuff. So from our standpoint, it was really no more complicated. I mean, Jess and I talked for like five minutes were like, okay, another quarter of a loss. A lot of -- lot catastrophes are a lot higher, almost two standard deviations away. We factored that in when we decided on the $5 billion. We factored that in when we looked at last year, keeping the program going. And it was a sensitivity, but it was a sensitivity, not a reality when insurance into a reality, you say, okay, let's just stop buying it back. And if we feel like getting back to it, we will. And we have a strong track record of buying stock back, but what will drive the value of our stock, and I can close on this is not share repurchases. Like we've looked at share repurchases. As I said, we bought $37 billion back. The return on share repurchases, if you take the price that you bought it at and the price of the stock at any point in time. Of course, it varies like it's cheap now, in my opinion. And so it would be good to buyback. But when you look at it over an extended period of time, it kind of turns into the cost of capital, which makes some sense. Sometimes you get a 20% return because you buyback cheap and the stock went on to run. Sometimes you buy it and it stacks up and you get lower return. But when you look at it over a long period of time, so you don't really create shareholder value by doing share buybacks. If you don't do share buybacks, you destroy shareholder value. That's a bad thing. But -- so the way we're going to create shareholder value is get profitability up, execute transformer growth and broaden our -- the product offering to people and things like protection plans, which are low capital, high growth, high-return businesses, health and benefits in the same way. So that's our plan. We look -- thank you for tuning in this quarter, and we'll talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's turn to Slide 4. We are seeing the impact of our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan in our financial results, starting with the rate increases we have implemented to date. The chart on the left shows Property-Liability earned premium increased 9.6% above the prior year quarter, driven by higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, which were partially offset by a decline in policies in force. Price increases and cost reductions were largely offset by severe weather events and increased accident frequency and claim severity. The underwriting loss of $2.1 billion in the quarter was $1.2 billion worse than the prior year quarter due to the $1.6 billion increase in catastrophe losses. The chart on the right highlights the components of the combined ratio, including 22.6 points from catastrophe losses. Prior year reserve reestimates, excluding catastrophes, had a 1.6 point adverse impact on the combined ratio in the quarter. Of the $182 million of strengthening in the second quarter, $148 million was in National General, primarily driven by personal auto injury coverages in the 2022 accident year. In addition, prior years were strengthened by approximately $31 million for litigation activity in the state of Florida related to torque reform that was passed in March of this year. We've been closely monitoring the increase in filed suits on existing claims and the charge reflects a combination of higher legal defense costs and a modest loss reserve adjustment. Despite continuing pressure on the loss side, the underlying combined ratio of 92.9 improved modestly by 0.5 points compared to the prior year quarter and 0.4 points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023. Now, let's move to slide five to discuss Allstate's auto insurance profitability in more detail. The second quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 108.3% was 0.4 points higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and increased current report year accident frequency and severity, which were largely offset by higher earned premium, expense reductions, and lower adverse non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates. We continue to raise rates, reduce expenses, restrict growth, and enhanced claim processes as part of our comprehensive plan to improve auto insurance margins. This slide depicts the impact of our profit improvement actions on underlying auto insurance profitability trends. As a reminder, we continually assess claim severities as the year progresses. And last year, as 2022 developed, we continue to increase report year ultimate severity expectations. The chart on the left shows the quarterly underlying combined ratios from 2022 through the current quarter with 2022 quarters adjusted to account for full year average severity assumptions, which removes the effect that intra-year severity changes had on recorded quarterly results. After adjusting for the timing of higher severity expectations, the quarterly underlying combined ratio trend was essentially flat throughout 2022. As we move into 2023, the underlying combined ratio has improved modestly in each of the first two quarters, reflecting both the impact of our profitability actions and the continued persistently high levels of loss cost inflation. The chart on the right depicts the percent change at annualized average earned premium shown by the blue line and the average underlying loss and expense per policy shown by the light blue bars compared to prior year-end. Rapid increases in claim severity and higher accident frequency since mid-2021, resulted in significant increases in the underlying loss and expense per policy which outpaced the change in average earned premium and drove a higher underlying combined ratio in both 2021 and 2022. As we've implemented rate increases, the annualized earned premium trend line continues to increase and has begun to outpace the still elevated underlying cost per policy in the first two quarters of 2023, resulting in a modest improvement in the underlying combined ratio. Slide six provides an update on the execution of our comprehensive approach to increase returns in auto insurance. There are four areas of focus; raising rates, reducing expenses, implementing underwriting actions, and enhancing claim practices to manage loss costs. Starting with rates, you remember the Allstate brand implemented 16.9% of rate in 2022. In the first six months of 2023, we have implemented an additional 7.5% across the book, including 5.8% in the second quarter. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022, an additional 5.5% through the first six months of 2023. We will continue to pursue rate increases in 2023 to restore auto insurance margins back to the mid-90s target levels. Reducing operating expenses is core to transformative growth, and we also temporarily reduced advertising to reflect the lower appetite for new business. We continue to have more restrictive underwriting actions on new business in locations and risk segments where we have not yet achieved adequate prices for the risk, but are beginning to selectively remove these restrictions in states and segments that are achieving target margins. To this point, the number of states achieving an underlying combined ratio better than 100 increased from 23 states, which represented just under 30% of Allstate brand auto insurance premium at the end of 2022 and to 36 states, representing approximately 50% of premium at the end of the second quarter. Ensuring that our claim practices are operating effectively and enhancing those practices where necessary, is key to delivering customer value, particularly in this high inflation environment. This includes modifying claim processes in both physical damage and injury coverages by doing things like increasing resources, expanding reinspections and accelerating the settlement of injury claims to mitigate the risk of continued loss development. We are also negotiating improved vendor service and parts agreements to offset some of the inflation associated with repairing vehicles. Slide 7 provides an update on progress in three large states with a disproportionate impact on profitability. The table on the left provides rate increases either implemented so far this year are currently pending with the respective insurance department in California, New York and New Jersey. Because our current prices are not adequate to cover our costs in these states, we have had to take actions to restrict new business volumes. As a result, new issued applications from the combination of California, New York and New Jersey declined by approximately 62% compared to the prior year quarter. In California, we implemented a second 6.9% rate increase in April and also filed for a 35% increase in the second quarter that is currently pending with the Department of Insurance. We continue to work closely with the California Department to secure approval of this filing and restore auto rates to an adequate level. In New York, we implemented approximately three points of weighted rate in June, driven by approved increases in two closed companies. And subsequently received approval for a 6.7% increase in the larger open companies, which was implemented in July, we will continue to make further filings in 2023 that will be additive to their -- to the rates approved so far this year. In New Jersey, we received approval for a 6.9% rate increase in the first quarter and filed a subsequent 29% increase in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we anticipate implementing additional rate increases for the balance of 2023 to counteract persistent loss cost increases. Slide 8 dives deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. The chart on the left shows the property liability underwriting expense ratio and highlights drivers of the 2.5 point improvement in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first green bar shows the 1.4 point impact from advertising spend, which has been temporarily reduced, given a more limited appetite for new business. The second green bar shows the decline in operating costs, mainly driven by lower agent and employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums relative to fixed costs. Shifting to our longer-term trend on the right, we remain committed to reducing the adjusted expense ratio as part of transformative growth. This metric starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate. Through innovation and strong execution, we've driven significant improvement with a second quarter adjusted expense ratio of 24.7%. We expect to drive additional improvement, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024, which represents a 6-point reduction compared to our starting point in 2018. While increasing average premiums certainly represent a tailwind, our intent in establishing the goal is to become more price competitive. This requires a sustainable improvement in our cost structure with our future focus on three primary areas, including enhancing digitization and automation capabilities, improving operating efficiency through outsourcing, business model rationalization and centralized support and enabling higher growth distribution at lower cost through changes in agency compensation structure and new agent models. Now, let's move to slide 9 to review homeowner insurance results, which despite improving underlying performance, incurred an underwriting loss in the quarter driven by elevated catastrophe losses. Our business model incorporates a differentiated product, underwriting, reinsurance and claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. Our approach has consistently generated industry-leading underwriting results despite quarterly or yearly fluctuations in catastrophe losses. Our homeowners insurance combined ratio, including the impact of catastrophes, has outperformed the industry by 12 points from 2017 through 2022. During that same time period, we generated annual average underwriting income of approximately $650 million. The chart on the left shows key Allstate Protection homeowners insurance operating statistics for the quarter. Net written premium increased 12.4% from the prior year quarter, predominantly driven by higher average gross premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 1% increase in policies in force. Allstate brand average gross written premium per policy increased by 13.2% compared to the prior year quarter driven by implemented rate increases throughout 2022 and an additional 7.4 points implemented through the first six months of 2023 as well as inflation in insured home replacement costs. While the second quarter homeowners combined ratio is typically higher than full year results, primarily due to seasonally high severe weather-related catastrophe losses, the second quarter of 2023 combined ratio of 145.3% was among the highest in Allstate's history and increased by 37.8 points compared to last year's second quarter due to a 40.3 point increase in the catastrophe loss ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 67.6% improved by 1.9 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium, lower frequency and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher severity. The chart on the right provides a historical perspective on the second quarter property liability catastrophe loss ratio of 75.9 points, which was elevated compared to historical experience, reflecting an increased number of catastrophe events and larger losses per event. While the second quarter result was 33.9 points above the 15-year second quarter average of 42 points, it is not unprecedented and filled within modeled outcomes contemplated in our economic capital framework. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the homeowners business and continue to respond to loss trends by implementing rate increases to address higher repair costs and limiting exposures in geographies where we cannot achieve adequate returns for our shareholders. And now I'll hand it over to Jesse to discuss the remainder of our results. I think, Greg, the thing I'd add is less about to Tom's point, what we expect going forward and more about what we're seeing and maybe just give you a little more color underneath the loss cost trend. So as you remember, last quarter, we started giving you pure premium trends as opposed to coverage specific frequency and severity because we just think it's a better way for you to evaluate where overall profitability is going. And the point I'd make is if you look on Slide 5, as Tom pointed out, for the first couple of quarters this year, we've seen the average earned premium trend begin to outpace the increases in loss and expense. It's hard to predict what the future will hold, but that's an encouraging development. Underneath that loss trend, if you look at where we're at in the second quarter compared to where we were for the full year last year, the increase in pure premium is about 12.5%, and we told you that severity is up on average across all coverages by about 11%. So what we're seeing still is persistently high severity across coverages with a lesser impact from overall frequency increases. The point being we're going to continue to aggressively implement our profit improvement plan, you've seen what we've done with rates. We've done 7.5 points through the first half of this year in the Allstate brand, 5.5 points on National General. We're going to continue to do that. You see the benefit that the cost reductions is having on the combined ratio while that rate earns in. And we've talked a lot about those three states, which make up about one-quarter of our book, California, New York and New Jersey. We want to keep pushing on continuing to drive rate increases into the book. We've gotten some approvals so far this year, but there's rates pending, pretty significant rates pending in California and New Jersey, and we're prepared to file another rate in New York. So we're going to keep pushing really hard on that. And in the meantime, we've scaled way back on new business production in those states. And while it's having a reasonably small impact on the loss ratio so far this year, because new business just tends to be a smaller proportion of our overall book, it will continue to have a favorable impact on our loss ratio going forward. And until we get to adequate rates in those three states, we're going to keep restricting the volume of business we're willing to write. Yes. So, Greg, the place I'd start with National General, you're right. We're growing in National General that's principally in the specialty vehicle or the non-standard auto part of the business, which that market continues to experience pretty significant disruption. A couple of things I'd say on NatGen. First of all, the underlying combined ratio in the quarter was 96%, and 96% is slightly higher than we want to run it at, but it's pretty close to our target margin. And that 96% includes the kind of roll-forward impact of increasing reserves principally in the 2022 accident year and therefore, increasing our loss expectations in the 2023 year. So, that's all embedded in the 96%. A couple of things in addition to that, that I mentioned. We've talked a lot about the profit improvement plan, we're implementing that same approach in that same plan in National General across the same levers we're using in the Allstate brand. We've taken 5.5 points of rate this year, 11 points of rate over the last 12 months in NatGen. And given that it's predominantly a non-standard auto book, the book tends to turn over and get repriced pretty rapidly. So, we're comfortable that the rate we've taken so far this year is working its way into the system. And I would say in response to a higher loss trend that we've seen in 2023, we've accelerated our plan to take rate in 2023. So, we're ahead of that 5.5 points is ahead of where we expected to be at this point during the year. We've also restricted underwriting guidelines in a number of states, we're writing more liability-only less full coverage. So, we're being really selective about what we're writing. And the other benefit, as Tom mentioned, part of the rationale around acquiring National General was the opportunity to lower costs and improve the expense ratio, and we're benefiting from that inside that 96% underlying combined ratio. We've seen a pretty significant improvement year-over-year in the underwriting expense ratio as we essentially take advantage of scale through the growth we're getting. So, comfortable where we're positioned. We're taking the appropriate actions from a profitability perspective. And so we're comfortable with what we're writing in NatGen right now."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Nogal: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement, and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. As some of you know, this will be my final earnings call as the leader of our Investor Relations team, and I will be transitioning to a new role in our P&C finance area supporting National General. I'm leaving Investor Relations in the capable hands of Brent Vandermause, who will be a great partner for all of you going forward. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning. We're excited for Mark, and we're completely confident that Brent is going to give you everything you need to help you decide how and why you want to invest in Allstate. So good morning. We appreciate the investment of your time in Allstate today. Let's start with an overview results, and then Mario and Jess are going to walk through the operating results and the actions that we're taking to increase shareholder value. So let's start on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy, as you know, has two components, increased personal property-liability market share and expand protection services. Those are shown in the two ovals on the left. If you go to the right-hand side of the slide, you can see a summary of the results for the first quarter. We had a net loss of $346 million in the first quarter, which reflects a property liability underwriting loss which was only partially offset by strong investment income and profits from protection services and health and benefits. We're making good progress on executing the comprehensive plans to improve auto insurance profitability, and of course, we'll have a substantive discussion on that today. Not to be overlooked, we also continue to advance Transformative Growth plan, which is to execute the top oval there, which is to increase Property-Liability market share. At the same time, Allstate Protection Plans in the lower oval continues to expand its product offering and geographic footprint. Let's review the financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $13.8 billion in the first quarter increased 11.8% or nearly $1.5 billion as compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, resulting in Property-Liability earned premium growth of 10.8%. In the auto insurance line, higher insurance premiums and lower expenses were essentially offset by increased loss costs, so the profit improvement plan has not yet returned margins to historical levels. The auto insurance line had an underwriting loss of $346 million in the quarter. In homeowners, the story is really about $1.7 billion of catastrophes, which led to an underwriting loss of $534 million. The total underwriting loss was just under $1 billion. Net investment income of $575 million benefited from higher yields, which mostly offset an income decline from performance-based investments. Protection Services and Health and Benefits generated adjusted net income of $90 million in the quarter. As a result, the adjusted net loss was $342 million or $1.30 a share. Now let me turn it over to Mario to discuss Property-Liability results.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's flip to Slide 4. The chart on the left shows the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio since 2017. As you can see, Allstate has a long history of generating strong underwriting results though the current operating environment is challenging, with combined ratios over 100 last year and into the first quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.3 for the first quarter was slightly below the full year 2022. The second chart compares the full year 2022 recorded combined ratio for all lines of business to the first quarter of this year, which removes the influence of intra-year severity changes that occurred throughout 2022. The first red bar shows the underlying loss ratio was essentially unchanged as higher premiums were offset by increased loss costs. The second red bar on the left shows most of the increase in the combined ratio was driven by higher catastrophe losses, reflecting the widespread severe weather in the first quarter of this year. Expenses were lower by 1.9 points of premiums and minimal non-catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates also had a positive impact. Let's move to Slide 5 to review Allstate's auto insurance profitability in more detail. As you can see from the chart on the left, which shows the auto insurance recorded and underlying combined ratios from 2017 through the current quarter, we have a long history of sustained profitability in auto insurance as we successfully leveraged our capabilities and pricing sophistication, underwriting and claims expertise and expense management to generate excellent returns in the auto insurance business. Since mid-2021, loss costs have increased rapidly, driving combined ratios above our mid-90s target. The profit improvement plan is designed to address these significant loss cost increases, and we're making good progress. The chart on the right compares the recorded combined ratio of 104.4 in the first quarter to full year 2022 results. Starting on the left, higher average earned premiums drove a 5.7 point favorable impact, which is shown in the first green bar. The first red bar reflects a 6.5 point increase in underlying loss cost due to increased accident frequency and severity for the 2023 report year, with severity currently projected in the 9% to 11% range above the full prior report year. A lower expense ratio reflects expense reductions and higher earned premiums. The remaining difference was due to catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates. All in, both the recorded and underlying combined ratios of 104.4 and 102.6, respectively, improved in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022. Slide 6 provides an update on the execution of our comprehensive approach to increase returns in auto insurance. There are four focus areas, raising rates, reducing expenses, implementing underwriting actions and enhancing claim practices to manage loss costs. Starting with rates. Following increases of 16.9% in 2022, the Allstate brand implemented an additional 1.7% of rate increases in the first quarter. We will continue to pursue rate increases in 2023 to restore auto insurance margins. Reducing operating expenses is core to Transformative Growth. We have also temporarily reduced advertising to reflect a lower appetite for new business. We implemented more restrictive underwriting actions on new business in locations and risk segments where we have not yet achieved adequate prices for the risk. As we move through 2023, it is likely that some of these restrictions will be removed where there are profitable growth opportunities. Enhancing claim practices in a high inflation environment is key to delivering customer value. This includes leveraging strategic partnerships and scale with repair facilities and parts suppliers to mitigate the cost of repairing vehicles. In addition, settlement of pending bodily injury claims has been accelerated to avoid continued increases in costs and settlements. Transitioning to Slide 7. Let's discuss progress in three large states with a disproportionate impact on auto profitability. The table depicts Allstate brand auto new business production and rate actions for California, New York and New Jersey. As a result of implemented profitability actions, new issued applications from the combination of California, New York and New Jersey declined by 40% compared to the prior year quarter. The decline in these three states meaningfully contributed to the 22% decline countrywide. The right-hand portion of the table provides rate increases either taken or needed to improve margins. In California, we just received approval for a second 6.9% rate increase implemented in April, which will be effective in June. We continue to work closely with the California Department on the best path forward to getting rates to an adequate level and expect to file for an additional increase in the second quarter, which will reflect the balance of our full rate need. In New York, we filed for additional rate in the first quarter that is currently pending with the Department of Financial Services. In New Jersey, we attained a 6.9% rate increase in the first quarter and expect to pursue additional filings in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we anticipate implementing additional rates across the country into 2023 to counteract persistent loss cost increases. Slide 8 dives deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. The chart on the left shows the property liability underwriting expense ratio over time and highlights drivers of the 2.9 points of improvement in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first green bar on the left shows the 2 point improvement impact from advertising spend, which has been reduced given a limited interest in new business at current rate levels. The last two green bars show a decline in operating and distribution costs mainly driven by lower agent and employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums. Shifting to our longer-term target on the right, we remain on pace to reducing the adjusted expense ratio to 23 by year-end 2024 as part of transformative growth. This metric starts with our underwriting expense ratio excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate. Through innovation and strong execution, we've driven significant improvement relative to 2018, with first quarter adjusted expense ratio of 24.9. We expect to drive additional improvement, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by the end of next year by represents a 6-point reduction compared to 2018. The increase in average premiums certainly represents a tailwind, however, our intent in establishing the goal is to become more price competitive. This requires a sustainable reduction in our cost structure, with future focus on three principal areas, including enhancing digitization and automation capabilities, improving operating efficiency through outsourcing, business model rationalization and centralized support, and enabling higher growth distribution at lower costs through changes in agency compensation structure and new agent models. Now let's move to Slide 9 to review homeowner insurance results, which incurred an underwriting loss in the quarter despite favorable underlying performance due to elevated catastrophe losses. We have a superior business model that includes differentiated product, underwriting, reinsurance and a claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. As you can see by the chart on the left, this approach consistently generates industry-leading underwriting results despite quarterly or yearly fluctuations in catastrophe losses. The chart on the right shows key Allstate Protection homeowners insurance operating statistics for the first quarter. Net written premium increased 11.1% from the prior year quarter, predominantly driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 1.4% increase in policies in force. The first quarter homeowners combined ratio of 119 increased by 35.1 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher catastrophe losses primarily related to five large wind events in March. These accounted for more than 70% of catastrophe losses in the quarter. The first quarter catastrophe loss ratio was significantly elevated compared to the prior year and 10-year historical average by 36.2 and 30.5 points, respectively. The underlying combined ratio of 67.6 improved 0.4 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium and a lower expense ratio partially offset by higher claim severity. Slide 10 provides an update on Transformative Growth. Transformative Growth remains a focus and is being executed in parallel with our profit improvement actions. We continue to make good progress on this multiyear initiative that spans five main components: improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, modernizing the technology ecosystem and driving organizational transformation. The bottom half of the slide highlights recent progress by intended outcome. Providing the lowest cost insurance through expense reductions, broad distribution and pricing sophistication is key to growth. Our Allstate brand relative competitive position has deteriorated recently as rate increases have exceeded some competitors. We expect that those competitors will eventually raise rates, improving our competitive position and growth prospects. Distribution has been expanded by launching middle market and preferred products through independent agents under the National General brand. These products are currently available in approximately 25% of the U.S. market, with a plan to be in nearly every market by the end of next year. Our new affordable, simple and connected auto product creates a differentiated customer experience, which is expected to become available in approximately one-third of the U.S. through the direct distribution channel by the end of this year, deploying a new technology stack, integrating technology across brands and retiring legacy technology applications provides increased agility and lowers costs. This will be reflected in the sunset of the Esurance and Encompass technology platforms next year. We believe transformative growth will lead to increased market share, and hence, higher company valuation multiples. And now, I'll turn it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results.\nJess Merten: All right. Thank you, Mario. Let's start with Slide 11, which covers results for our Protection Services and Health and Benefits businesses. Chart on the left shows Protection Services revenues excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, which increased 7% to $671 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Increase reflects growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Dealer Services, partially offset by a decline in Arity. By leveraging the Allstate brand, excellent customer service, expanded product offerings and partnerships with leading retailers, Protection Plans continues to generate profitable growth, resulting in a 17% increase in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. In the table below the chart, you will see that adjusted net income of $34 million in the first quarter decreased $19 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher appliance and furniture claim severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. We will continue to invest in these businesses which provide an attractive opportunity to meet our customers' needs and create value for shareholders. Shifting to the chart on the right, Health and Benefits provide stable revenues and is consistently profitable while protecting more than 4 million customers. Revenues of $583 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased by $3 million compared to the prior year quarter as an increase in group health and other revenue was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employee benefits. Health and Benefits operating systems are being rebuilt to lower costs and support growth, which will leverage the Allstate brand and customer base to generate shareholder value. Adjusted net income of $56 million was in line with the prior year quarter. Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted the FASB guidance, revising the accounting for certain long-duration insurance contracts in the Allstate Health and Benefits segment using the modified retrospective approach to the transition date of January 1, 2021. This had an immaterial impact on our results. Now let's move to Slide 12, which depicts trends in our investment portfolio allocation. Our active portfolio management includes comprehensive monitoring of markets, sectors and individual names, and we proactively reposition based on our views of economic conditions, market opportunities and the risk return trade-off. Asset class holdings are shown on the left. Our $63.5 billion investment portfolio includes a large allocation to high quality interest bearing assets, which has increased in recent years. In response to increasing recession risks, we defensively position the portfolio in 2022 by reducing our exposure to below investment grade bonds and public equity. We maintain this defensive position in the first quarter with additional reductions in our public equity exposure. Our performance based portfolio shown in green and gray enhances long-term returns and is broadly diversified with more than 400 assets. The portfolio is largely U.S. exposure that span vintage years, sponsors and sectors. Exposure to real estate and commercial mortgage loans is modest at $2.8 billion or 4% of the portfolio and is focused on more resilient sectors such as industrial and multifamily. We hold only $230 million in office properties for mortgages. In addition to real estate, we have selective exposure to the banking sector totaling about $4.5 billion and consists primarily of investment-grade, fixed income securities issued by large financial institutions. We hold $240 million of exposure to regional banks, primarily larger regional banks, and we did not realize significant losses related to recent bank failures. Our high-quality portfolio provides flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities as economic conditions evolve while providing substantial liquidity to protect our customers. Let's shift from investment allocation to performance on Slide 13. As shown in the table at the bottom of the chart on the left, total return on our portfolio was 2.4% in the first quarter and 1.2% over the last 12 months. Net investment income, shown in the chart on the left, totaled $575 million in the quarter, which is $19 million below the first quarter of last year. Market-based income of $507 million, shown in blue, was $184 million above the prior year quarter following the proactive decision to reposition the market-based portfolio into higher market yields and an increase in fixed income funded by our reduction in public equity. Performance-based income of $126 million, shown in black, was $180 million below a strong prior year quarter. Volatility from quarter-to-quarter on these assets is expected. Our portfolio management and the allocation of risk capital to investments is highly integrated with the assessment of risk-adjusted return opportunities across the enterprise. As you'll recall, in response to declines in auto insurance profitability, last year, we defensively positioned the portfolio against rising rates and reduced our exposure to recession sensitive assets. As market rate grows, we began to increase the duration in the fourth quarter and ended the first quarter at four years. This duration extension locks in higher yields and income for longer while positioning the portfolio to benefit from potential future reductions in interest rates. The chart on the right shows the fixed income earned yield continues to rise and was 3.4% at quarter end. Our portfolio yield is still below the current intermediate corporate bond yield of approximately 5.1%, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields if rates stay at these levels. To close, let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss Allstate's strong financial position and prudent approach to capital management. In light of recent financial events impacting the banking industry, let's start with an overview of Allstate's liabilities. As you can see in the chart on the left, our liabilities primarily consist of property casualty claim reserves and unearned premiums that are not subject to unpredictable or immediate demand for repayment. Our sophisticated economic capital framework quantifies enterprise risk to establish capital targets by business, product, geography and investment while also providing additional capital for stress events or contingencies. The framework incorporates regulatory capital standards, proprietary econometric modeling, I struggled with that, rating agency criteria and other external assessments. It's used through the company from individual product and state-based decisions to establishing the appropriate amount of capital for each company and the overall corporation. Allstate's capital of $19.2 billion exceeds our target capital based on this framework. Our ratings remain strong, with S&P and Moody's assigning an issuer credit rating of A minus and A3, respectively, to our recent senior debt offering. Holding company assets of $4.2 billion as of the end of the first quarter represent approximately 2.5x our annual fixed charges. We returned $377 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. As a sign of our financial strength and commitment to shareholder returns, the common dividend was increased by 4.7% in the first quarter and paid in early April. With that as context, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question please.\nGregory Peters: Well, good morning, everyone. A lot to unpack in your comments. I think what I'd like to do for my question and follow-up would be to focus on, first, Slide 5. And I was interested in your comments about the average underlying loss ratio, I think, up 6.5% in first quarter versus the average earned premium being a good guide for 5.7%. I guess the question would be, is the expectation that 6.5% is going to continue? And when will the average earned premium go beyond where the underlying loss ratio deterioration is?\nTom Wilson: I'll get Mario to dig in on claim expenses. When you look at the 5.7%, I'll remind you -- first, good morning, Greg. I'll remind you that remember, this is a number that's been trending up as the rates that we took in '21 and '22 start to be earned in. So we would expect that number to continue to increase as we earn in the rates we've already implemented, and so we think this. In terms of claims severity, I'll let Mario give you an update on where we are and what we're thinking about.\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Good morning, Greg. So in terms of claims severity, what we disclosed this quarter was across major coverages. We're running in the 9% to 11% range in both physical damage and in injury coverages. Really, the drivers of those costs, if you start with physical damage, we continue to see pretty persistent inflation particularly in parts and labor costs to repair cars. Actually, used car prices or total values for used cars actually came down a little bit in the first quarter in our numbers, but we had a higher percentage of total loss frequency which impacted the mix, so those are really the drivers. And on bodily injury, it's the same things we've been talking about. Medical inflation, medical consumption and attorney representation. So I think the drivers of severity continue to persist. In terms of where they're going forward, it's really anybody's guess, but I think our perspective is, and we've been pretty consistent on this point, we're going to continue to take prices up. We've been doing that really since the fourth quarter of 2021 throughout last year. That continued into the first quarter. We're going to continue to, on a forward-looking basis, implement rate increases to first catch up and then outpace loss cost trends. But our perspective on rates as we continue to need to push more price through the system, and we intend to do that throughout the balance of 2023.\nGregory Peters: Right. On Slide 7, you -- in your comments, you talked about those three states. And I guess a follow-up question would be, where do you think that's going to go from a rate perspective? I think you said in your comment, Mario, that you expect to file the balance of your full rate need in California, and won't that trigger a different process causing a delay in potential rate approvals? So give us some color on that slide, please.\nMario Rizzo: Sure. So first I'll start with -- as we talked about, we just got approval for a second 6.9% auto rate increase in California, so we're -- going back to the fourth quarter of last year, we've got approval for 2 6.9% rates, and we've done that by working closely with the department to lay out our data and our loss costs. In those conversations, and I think you've seen some of this across the industry, the department is really encouraging carriers to file for the rate need that they have in their book as opposed to going forward with 6.9% rate increase filings, and it's really based on just the volume of rate filings they're getting. So as we talk to the commissioner and the department, we got -- we're able to secure approval for the two 6.9% rate increases, and we intend on filing the balance of our rate need going forward. Does that create risk in intervention? It does. But I think we need to get California auto prices back to where they need to be so that we can create the kind of availability for consumers, really, that they deserve in California. So we're going to work with the department closely, we're going to make that filing, and then we'll see where that takes us going forward.\nTom Wilson: So Greg, I think embedded in your question is, will you be challenged on something above 6.9%? The strategy that [Guy Hill] and team put into place was take 6.9% -- get 6.9%, don't have to have a consumer advocate come in and look at it, get another 6.9% and then go for the full rate. So what you're seeing us do it in three chunks. Other people have tried to do it other ways. We think this is the right way for us.\nGregory Peters: Got it. In New York, New Jersey?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. We got some rate filings pending with the New York department that hopefully will get resolved soon. And then New Jersey, you see, we were able to implement a rate increase and we're going to come back and file another rate increase. So we're working hard to get these three states off of this page.\nGregory Peters: Got it. Thank you for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your question please.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more additional color on the risk inflation rate. Is it fair to say that what we saw in the first quarter was an acceleration of frequency or severity trends that was unexpected? And if so, maybe you could talk about a little bit more of the pieces that were that much worse that may have seemed to have caught some people in the industry off guard.\nTom Wilson: Paul, you're breaking up a little bit, so let me just make sure I get it. So we're talking about auto insurance severity trends first quarter versus -- is that a tick up from what you saw last year? Or is it the level on? If that's the question, I'll just -- Mario can jump into that.\nMario Rizzo: Yes. I guess what I would say about severity, again, in that 9% to 11% range is it just remains persistently high, I think, is how I would describe it, and that's true across coverages. It's certainly lower than what our expectations were for severity last year, what our ultimate forecast is for 2022. But it still remains at elevated levels, which is why I go back to we're going to need to continue to push rate through the system through the balance of this year to combat that inflation.\nPaul Newsome: Is that -- should we interpret that as a further acceleration of rate? I mean, I think you were expecting to put rate -- more rate anyway, right? I guess the question is do we have a step function up a little bit from where we would have been?\nTom Wilson: Yes. Paul, I think there's a little bit of -- I mean, when you're looking at the percentages, it gets a little confusing when you're in a high increase environment. So if you looked at the numbers that Mario was talking about, are the percentages up versus the full year of 2022, not versus the first quarter of last year. As you know, the percentages kept going up as we move throughout the year and we adjusted our results, so what we've decided to do is to talk about the percentages up versus the full year. And I think, Mario, it is -- said it well, which is it continues to be high. And so we're trying to -- if you look at the percentage up versus what we thought it was in the first quarter, it would be higher than 10% to 11%, but it's not higher than what we thought the first quarter was at the end of last year. So as it relates to pricing, we're looking at just total loss cost frequency and severity, and we have to -- we believe we have to continue to increase prices this year. As Mario talked about, we were up almost 17% in the Allstate brand last year. I don't know. We don't have a target for what it will be this year. As Mario said, it's going to be what it needs to be.\nPaul Newsome: No, that's helpful. I always appreciate the help, and I'll let some other folks ask questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I just wanted to talk about your RBC ratio. I mean, we see the cat losses and we can see the impact that that would have had on statutory income in the quarter. But you guys also did cut your equity investments in half, which I think could have maybe a 20-point benefit in RBC. Is there a way for you guys to walk through the moving components of RBC in the quarter and give us a sense of where your RBC ratio would be within AIC at the end of the Q1?\nTom Wilson: Elyse thanks for the question. Let me provide a little overview and then Jess will jump into the specifics. The headline would be, we don't just look at RBC. And so as Jess said, so -- I mean, if you step back and say, what are the learnings from the recent bank failures? Having a capital problem is not something that just happens to you like an auto accident [ph], right? It's a result of a series of choices made over time. So in terms of our series of choices, we had this really comprehensive set of processes around those choices that are highly analytical. We look at all kinds of scenarios. We look at it frequently, and as a result of that, we come up with what we think the right amount of capital. It includes things like RBC it includes things, like the rating agencies it includes. In some cases, we are more restrictive in terms of the amount of capital we think we need than other people. So we don't play the game of RBC arbitrage, so to speak, and fool ourselves. With that, Jess, do you want to talk about how you think about capital and where we're at?\nJess Merten: Yes. Thanks, Tom. I mean I think, as you and I have talked before at least, we try and take a look at our capital position using our sophisticated economic capital I know it's not just the RBC ratios. We don't - just to be clear to your specific question. We don't publish and have not published the RBC ratio for this quarter, and so I'm not in a position to take you through the bits and pieces on this call. I think directionally, you and others have noted what the RBC impacts would be. But I think it's more important to think about the way that we manage capital and the way that we look at it on a comprehensive basis, not just and RBC basis. And I think you've seen reflected in the results that we continue to proactively manage our overall capital position. So again, I go back to our economic capital model, the sophisticated and comprehensive way that we look at capital, including all different sources and uses, and feel confident in our capital position being, as I said in my prepared remarks, above our internal targeted levels.\nTom Wilson: But you shouldn't take the fact that we have less equity as a statement that we thought we needed to save capital. We have less public equity holdings, because we didn't think it was a good risk return trade-off, which John [ph] will be happy to talk about it if somebody wants to go through. But we think we have plenty of capital on this business.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, your personal auto underlying loss ratio did improve sequentially, right? There are some noise, right, as there were some true-ups in the fourth quarter last year. And also, I thought that seasonally, Q1 for auto tends to be better. But I guess when we put this altogether and you guys you are talking about taking - still earning in some - a good amount of rate increases. Do you think that the personal auto loss ratio peaked in the first quarter and should we expect it to improve from here?\nTom Wilson: Well, first, we think the profit improvement plan is working. I would say, Elyse, that if you just summarize the first quarter, I would say we held serve, we held serve in the face of, if you're a tennis fan, 120-mile an hour serve, which was called continued high increase in severity. How will - we'll return the ball, and as you point out, it's about where it was last year. It is improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, but you're absolutely right. Yes, there were some other things going around in the fourth quarter related to the first, second and third quarter of last year. So it's not quite fair to say that it improved. I would just say we held serve. We feel good about where we're going. In our mind, it's a question of when, not if we will get back to how we make profitability. And that's, of course, dependent on what happens with inflation and costs.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. May be starting with the current capital position, the reallocation of some of the investments, can you maybe talk about how you see the capital in maybe capital market stress scenarios? And I'm sure you run those internally, any color you can offer around that would be much appreciated?\nTom Wilson: Yaron, I'm not exactly sure. Maybe you can give me another layer down in the question so we can get specific for you?\nYaron Kinar: Sure. So I think you're talking about, what, roughly $4 billion of liquidity or access about the holdco and I think, $16 billion of liquidity. What happens to those - we find capital markets stressed? I don't know if there's another 25% decrease in the equity market, maybe a credit cycle. I'm not exactly sure what kind of scenario to paint, because I don't want to put you on the spot with a specific set of declines. But I'm sure you do test, this excess capital availability against stresses in the system?\nTom Wilson: Yes. No, it's a good point. Let me get John to answer that. I'll give you a little overview [ph]. First, I would just say analytics everywhere. It counts for everyone despite. So whether that's using sophisticated models is that where they toll the car or extending duration or what we're doing with capital. And so, when we look at the extension of duration, I think John ran like nine different scenarios, how to do it, what to do it, what and - so we're all over that. When it comes to stress events in the capital markets, we look at all kinds of alternatives there. Everything from -- and what do we do with the government defaults to what do we do if there's more bank failures. And so we have - and John can tell you sort, of how he's thinking about how we allocate assets in the portfolio relative to stress events in today's market. I would say from an overall capital standpoint, which is we got plenty of money. Like you saw our liabilities, they're very predictable, and so nobody is going to run in and say give us back our $10 billion and we don't have it. At the same time, we have a really highly liquid portfolio, because so much of it's in investment-grade fixed income. If it's fixed - investment-grade fixed income market is completely shut down, we would still probably be fine. Right now probably we would be fine, because we're having cash come in terms of unearned premiums every day, so we don't really have any overall liquidity issues. But in terms of capital market stress and how you think about that from an investment decisions and where we're invested today, John can give you some perspective.\nJohn Dugenske: Yes, Yaron, thank you so much for the question. Just a piece of data, if we can trade a security, we've had $5 billion of cash coming in the next year just by things that are rolling off. It's highly integrated into the overall data and analytics quantitative framework across the enterprise. So I answered this question, I feel confident that scores of people on the investment team could answer too, because it's part of the way that we think. We're not managing an investment portfolio separate from the way that we think about the enterprise. Tom talked a little bit about the duration trade that we did that was highlighted in the materials. That's not taken in isolation of how all the other securities in the portfolio would perform and it's not taken in isolation on how we think about the entire enterprise, what happens in underwriting and other areas. We run probably 100 different scenarios on a daily basis that look back at things that have happened in the past, things that could happen in the future, what that means for returns and what that means for capital. And we subscribe to getting the order of ready, aim and fire, right? So we really aim a lot as we think about our investment profile.\nYaron Kinar: Thanks. And then maybe shifting back to the auto book, is the piece or the cadence of rate increases that you expect to file in auto kind of similar to where it was when we ended in 2022 or do you see maybe additional rate increases are necessary today relative to the plan at the beginning of the year?\nTom Wilson: Where is, the plan at the beginning of the year. So maybe I'll give an overview, Mario, with an analogy and you can bear. We're running as fast and as hard as we can on rates everywhere. If we need them, we're really running fast and hard. If we think, we're actually adequately priced in some states where we are today, we're still paying attention. We're still on the track. We're so warmed up and ready to run if we need to be.\nMario Rizzo: Yes. What I would add Yaron, I'm going to go back to a comment I made earlier, which is we've been pretty consistent on this point of the need to take prices up going back to last year, and that hasn't changed. Now obviously, we react to new data, new information in real-time and the absolute amount of rate we take is going to be dependent on that updated data. As Tom mentioned earlier, we rely on heavy-duty analytics to manage the business and we respond to what's happening in real time, so the amount of rate we need will be dependent on how loss costs play out over time for us. But we're going to continue to push rate through the system. We've been successful at that. I wouldn't get too hung up on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations because that quarterly number is going to bounce around in terms of the rates that were approved in a particular state, and the size of those rates. But I think thematically, I'm going to go back to what we've been saying now for -- over the last year, which is we're going to continue to take the rate that we need to get auto margins back to where they need to be, which is in the mid-90s targets that we have.\nYaron Kinar: Thanks and good luck, Mark, with the new role.\nMario Rizzo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thank you and good morning. I'm trying to unpack the earlier comment about used car prices coming down a bit, because the Manheim Index was up about 8.6%, and that's kind of a forward-looking indicator. So maybe you could kind of give a little color on what your expectation there is for used car prices? Does that kind of fit in your 9% to 11% or could - of projected severity increase or could it be materially higher as we look out in the year?\nMario Rizzo: Hi Andrew, it's Mario. Thanks for the question. I guess what I'd start with, there's, a number of indices for used car prices. I think you mentioned one with Manheim that tends to focus on wholesale prices. And I think as we all know, that metric was coming down most of last year. Certainly in the back half of last year, and then it started to tick up in the end of the fourth quarter and has continued into this year. What I was referring to earlier is actual total loss severity, which tends to lag the Manheim Index and is more a function of retail used car prices, which have improved, and that's what I was referring to in the quarter. What we saw was actually used car - or I'm sorry, total loss severity actually improved a little bit year-over-year. In terms of the risk going forward, I think, yes. If you look at what's happening with the Manheim Index and other indices. Certainly, they're headed in a different direction than they were headed for much of last year, which adds risk. We've tried to factor that into our severity expectations in terms of what we're recording that 9% to 11% range. But what we actually saw in the first quarter of this year was a modest improvement in total loss severity.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it, all right. Thank you on that. And then it was interesting following National General with auto policies in force now of about $4.6 million off pretty significantly from $4.1 million last year. It looks like you're getting good rate increases. Your combined underlying was 94%, so which is pretty decent. So looking forward, it sounds like you haven't fully rolled it out. Is this something that could really catapult your policy in force at a very responsible return? I mean, maybe a little color on how that - what your expectations over the next year to -- for policy growth and doing so profitably?\nTom Wilson: Andrew thanks for focusing in on National General. For summary, we feel really good about the acquisition of National General. If you just start with the math, the numbers, it's exceeded our expectations and assumptions, because as you'll remember, we've mostly bought that so we could reduce our expenses in the independent agent channel by folding, basically having them reverse acquire Encompass, we just happen to buy them first. And so they've - and that's ahead of plan and the numbers are bigger. So, we're feeling really good about that, and that's the way we price the deal. You're - strategically, which is where you're after, we're also getting the benefit of now having a solid plan for an independent agent channel, which we did not before. We've been struggling to get a good platform so they have good technology, good relationships, as you point out, mostly in the nonstandard stuffing. Mario, I think in his comments, mentioned how we're now taking those relationships and that technology platform and we're putting what we call mid-market, which is basically standard auto and homeowners, on that platform, and that's going to give us great growth opportunities because we're using the Allstate expertise in both standard auto and - not to be underestimated, one bit really is our business model and homeowners. We think that's a great growth opportunity and which is basically icing on the cake relative to the acquisition. So, we feel really good about we're in that channel. It's part of Transformative Growth. It's part of increasing market share and personal profit liability, and we're pleased with the results.\nAndrew Kligerman: Awesome, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question please.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, thank you. I want to talk about segmentation and policy count. Obviously, the net decline in the auto policy count was quite high this quarter. Do you have some sort of advice or thoughts to think about how much policy count will decline over this repricing period? But two, I also note that homeowners policy count was flat which suggests in the segmentation, there's different policyholders you're keeping versus different policyholders you're losing. So I thought you might be able to touch on both things?\nTom Wilson: Good. Mario, why don't you talk about homeowners and what we're doing there to drive growth? As it relates to auto insurance, we just talked about sort of the Allstate brand, I think, which may be the numbers you're referring to, which is down versus Andrew's comment about National General, which is off. On the Allstate piece, there's, obviously two components. One is, are you selling more new business? And then the second is what's happening with retention. And as it relates to new business, we've taken the approach that a prospective rate increase is like a new business penalty. So as you know, when you sell a business, you're going to have - you got expenses. It is getting the customers more to get them right in front, and then the loss ratio is typically higher for new business than it is for existing business. If you need 10 points of rate on top of what you're currently selling it to, we've factored that into our growth projections on new business and said, well this -- at the very least, it's an additional 10 points of new business penalty. The worst is that when you raise your prices by 10%, all the money you spent getting the customer is wasted, because they go away and you churn it. So we've dialed back new business and advertising not so much, because we're trying to manage the P&L, but because we're managing the economic growth. And we think needing rate increases and going out and getting a new customer and saying, it's great, you bought it for $1,000. And then six months later saying, well, it was really $1,100 is not a good plan. So we've dialed back new business, and you see that really across the board. And Mario showed in some places, even more aggressively, like New York, New Jersey, and California have kidded Mario that like, you'll know every new business customer we get in New York if we keep this up personally. So that's basically an economic choice. On retention, of course, that's the customer's choice and it depends what happens in the marketplace and what other people are doing. Our retention has gone down. We do model that out. It's really very difficult to take those old models, so -- and give yourself any kind of good estimate on the current view because a couple of things have changed. One, these are much bigger increases than those models had in them. So those models are based on 5%, 6%, 7%, not on 10%, 12% or 15% or 14% [ph] in Texas. And at the same time, those models don't have the kind of competitive environment you're operating in where everybody else is raising rates at the same time. So we've shutdown new business, because we think it's economic and there's an increased new business penalty associated with being underpriced, and then we're managing to. What we want to do, of course, is we're highly focused on improving customer value, because people pay more, you got to do more for them. And so, we're working hard on making sure we do insurance reviews, get our agents for them [ph] homeowners is another great story that I think we've kind of - we get so focused on auto. We haven't really put - it's a great business model. Mario can talk about what we're doing to grow that business.\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. And homeowners, again, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, is a business that we continue to feel really good about in terms of where it's positioned from a profitable growth perspective. And what you saw in the quarter is that we actually increased policy count by about 1.4%. Retention actually picked up by a temp. And I think there's a couple of things when you kind of unpack what's happening with retention in homeowners because much -- as Tom talked about, we're having to take prices up in auto. The way we're taking price increases is in a highly segmented and targeted way, and that's helping from a retention perspective on homeowners because those bundled customers tend to be our longest-tenured, most profitable customers. We also bundle about 80% of homeowners' policies have on supporting auto line and the retention on a bundled customer where a homeowner that has an auto policy is meaningfully higher than a monoline homeowners, and we're continuing to see the benefit of that. And we've put processes in place both in terms of economic incentives for our agents and sales processes in the call centers on the direct side to incent additional bundling. And we're seeing some nice trends in terms of bundling rates, which is certainly helping homeowner growth through homeowner retention. We're going to continue to look for ways to grow the homeowner business. We think it provides a really compelling risk and return opportunity for us. The results are going to bounce around because there's volatility. This quarter is an example of that with catastrophe losses, but we continue to see our underlying combined ratio and loss ratio improve, and both through leveraging the tactics I talked about for retention production, particularly with bundled customers, we think we can continue to grow that line.\nJosh Shanker: Are the bundlers having the same problem that they get quoted or rate an entire six months later? Or is your pricing such that you can comfortably quote a bundle right now and think that you're going to retain them for 12 months?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, we're obviously quoting bundled customers right now. And when you look at the business we are writing, we're seeing really nice improvements in terms of quality and lifetime value, which is indicative of that bundling rate. And so yes, we're quoting it. And the other thing you got to remember, and this is true both from a retention and a new business perspective. Bundling, it's an easier experience and a more streamlined experience for customers. There's discounts associated with bundling as well that can help offset higher auto rates and incent customers to stay with us.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you for the detailed answers.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your question please.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks. A couple of questions here for you. First one, I'm just curious, I saw your expense ratio is down about 1 point x ad spend. Where are we in this Transformational Growth as far as the expense ratio reduction? How much can we potentially see here additional going forward? And then maybe on the -- an add on to that, what kind of a normalized ad spend as a percentage of earned premium, so we can kind of get a view on what our expense ratio should ultimately end up?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, Brian, this is Mario. Thanks for the question. Again, expenses as much as Tom talked earlier about, earned premium and loss ratio, we kind of held serve there. We did see the benefit of a lower expense ratio both in terms of the underwriting expense ratio and the adjusted expense ratio. Where we're at in the kind of continuum on the adjusted expense ratio, we set a goal to get that adjusted ratio down to about 23 by the end of 2024. And we're making really good progress on that, you saw continued progress on that this quarter. We certainly are being helped by higher earned premium which leveraged our cost. But we're continuing to see reductions in both operating costs and distribution-related costs, which are helping the expense ratio. And I talked a little bit earlier about the areas we're focused on, whether it's automation, digitization, sourcing and continuing to drive both operating and distribution costs down. We're going to -- those are really going to be the levers we pull to push the expense ratio ultimately to that goal that we set with Transformative Growth. So we're making good progress, feel really good about that. In terms of the level of marketing spend, certainly, we spent less this quarter on marketing than we did a year ago, and we've pulled that back. I think as Tom said earlier, really from an economic risk and return perspective, it doesn't make a lot of sense for us to invest aggressively in marketing at a time when our prices aren't adequate. But what we will do over time has more rates and -- or, I'm sorry, more states and more markets get to a rate level that we're comfortable with, we're going to surgically lean in. And as one of the components of Transformative Growth, we're going to look to both increase the level and the sophistication of the marketing investment that we make. And that will be commensurate with what we think the opportunity is to grow, so I can't sit here today and give you a specific dollar amount or our target that we're focused on. That's why we gave you the adjusted expense ratio, which excludes marketing costs because we're going to continue to invest in marketing when it makes economic sense and where it makes economic sense for us to lean in.\nTom Wilson: So let me just double click on the Transformative Growth piece. So the third piece of Transformative Growth is to increase the sophistication and investment in customer acquisition. We think we can and should be able to get new customers cheaper than we do today. There's lots of math we have around that. One of those is telematics, so we were the first out there with continuous telematics. We've been at it for over a decade. We're now taking telematics, and with Arity, we now think we can take telematics into new business, Brian. And actually, not have to have them download our app or put a device in their car to figure out how good a drive they are. We think we can use our sophisticated analytics to price them using telematics ahead of time, which will maybe -- to better manage your acquisition cost. So lots of work to go there, so plenty of opportunity to grow.\nBrian Meredith: Can I just -- one quick follow-up here. If I think of kind of going forward here, when you're looking at putting rate increases through for the remainder of the year, what's your kind of base case with respect to how you're thinking about inflation here? Are you assuming that the current inflationary environment in persisting through the remainder of 2023 as you're filing for rates?\nTom Wilson: Let me finish and make sure we respect for people's time on that question. So first, when you look at overall inflation, the numbers Fed and everybody else sees, that's one set of numbers. If you look at the inflation in what we do, it's of course, dramatically higher. And those are subject to different things. So whether the Fed tightens the economy, it doesn't tighten economy, probably isn't going to do a lot to keep people from having severe accidents, hurting themselves and needing a lot of medical care or then more lawyers getting involved in the case, nor will it have a huge impact on what the OEs charge on parts. They tend to charge more in parts based on what they're doing to overall profitability and how many new cars are selling. So if we go into a recession, they sell new cars, I don't expect they're going to cut car's prices. So we think inflation will persist in this business at a higher level than you see from the overall CPI, and that's why we're having to raise prices for our customers.\nTom Wilson: Thank you all for participating today. Thank you for being generous with your time. We're going a few minutes over. Our priorities, make sure we're going to make money in auto insurance and continue to leverage our superior position in homeowners as start to grow and execute Transformative Growth, whether that's by getting our costs down, rolling out new products, expanding our National General platform. And then we didn't spend any time today on the great stories we have in the lower oval, which is expanding Protection Services. So a lot of things we're working on hard to create more value for you. Thank you, and we'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Jess Merten",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Mario. Let's start with Slide 11, which covers results for our Protection Services and Health and Benefits businesses. Chart on the left shows Protection Services revenues excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, which increased 7% to $671 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Increase reflects growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Dealer Services, partially offset by a decline in Arity. By leveraging the Allstate brand, excellent customer service, expanded product offerings and partnerships with leading retailers, Protection Plans continues to generate profitable growth, resulting in a 17% increase in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. In the table below the chart, you will see that adjusted net income of $34 million in the first quarter decreased $19 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher appliance and furniture claim severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. We will continue to invest in these businesses which provide an attractive opportunity to meet our customers' needs and create value for shareholders. Shifting to the chart on the right, Health and Benefits provide stable revenues and is consistently profitable while protecting more than 4 million customers. Revenues of $583 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased by $3 million compared to the prior year quarter as an increase in group health and other revenue was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employee benefits. Health and Benefits operating systems are being rebuilt to lower costs and support growth, which will leverage the Allstate brand and customer base to generate shareholder value. Adjusted net income of $56 million was in line with the prior year quarter. Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted the FASB guidance, revising the accounting for certain long-duration insurance contracts in the Allstate Health and Benefits segment using the modified retrospective approach to the transition date of January 1, 2021. This had an immaterial impact on our results. Now let's move to Slide 12, which depicts trends in our investment portfolio allocation. Our active portfolio management includes comprehensive monitoring of markets, sectors and individual names, and we proactively reposition based on our views of economic conditions, market opportunities and the risk return trade-off. Asset class holdings are shown on the left. Our $63.5 billion investment portfolio includes a large allocation to high quality interest bearing assets, which has increased in recent years. In response to increasing recession risks, we defensively position the portfolio in 2022 by reducing our exposure to below investment grade bonds and public equity. We maintain this defensive position in the first quarter with additional reductions in our public equity exposure. Our performance based portfolio shown in green and gray enhances long-term returns and is broadly diversified with more than 400 assets. The portfolio is largely U.S. exposure that span vintage years, sponsors and sectors. Exposure to real estate and commercial mortgage loans is modest at $2.8 billion or 4% of the portfolio and is focused on more resilient sectors such as industrial and multifamily. We hold only $230 million in office properties for mortgages. In addition to real estate, we have selective exposure to the banking sector totaling about $4.5 billion and consists primarily of investment-grade, fixed income securities issued by large financial institutions. We hold $240 million of exposure to regional banks, primarily larger regional banks, and we did not realize significant losses related to recent bank failures. Our high-quality portfolio provides flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities as economic conditions evolve while providing substantial liquidity to protect our customers. Let's shift from investment allocation to performance on Slide 13. As shown in the table at the bottom of the chart on the left, total return on our portfolio was 2.4% in the first quarter and 1.2% over the last 12 months. Net investment income, shown in the chart on the left, totaled $575 million in the quarter, which is $19 million below the first quarter of last year. Market-based income of $507 million, shown in blue, was $184 million above the prior year quarter following the proactive decision to reposition the market-based portfolio into higher market yields and an increase in fixed income funded by our reduction in public equity. Performance-based income of $126 million, shown in black, was $180 million below a strong prior year quarter. Volatility from quarter-to-quarter on these assets is expected. Our portfolio management and the allocation of risk capital to investments is highly integrated with the assessment of risk-adjusted return opportunities across the enterprise. As you'll recall, in response to declines in auto insurance profitability, last year, we defensively positioned the portfolio against rising rates and reduced our exposure to recession sensitive assets. As market rate grows, we began to increase the duration in the fourth quarter and ended the first quarter at four years. This duration extension locks in higher yields and income for longer while positioning the portfolio to benefit from potential future reductions in interest rates. The chart on the right shows the fixed income earned yield continues to rise and was 3.4% at quarter end. Our portfolio yield is still below the current intermediate corporate bond yield of approximately 5.1%, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields if rates stay at these levels. To close, let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss Allstate's strong financial position and prudent approach to capital management. In light of recent financial events impacting the banking industry, let's start with an overview of Allstate's liabilities. As you can see in the chart on the left, our liabilities primarily consist of property casualty claim reserves and unearned premiums that are not subject to unpredictable or immediate demand for repayment. Our sophisticated economic capital framework quantifies enterprise risk to establish capital targets by business, product, geography and investment while also providing additional capital for stress events or contingencies. The framework incorporates regulatory capital standards, proprietary econometric modeling, I struggled with that, rating agency criteria and other external assessments. It's used through the company from individual product and state-based decisions to establishing the appropriate amount of capital for each company and the overall corporation. Allstate's capital of $19.2 billion exceeds our target capital based on this framework. Our ratings remain strong, with S&P and Moody's assigning an issuer credit rating of A minus and A3, respectively, to our recent senior debt offering. Holding company assets of $4.2 billion as of the end of the first quarter represent approximately 2.5x our annual fixed charges. We returned $377 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. As a sign of our financial strength and commitment to shareholder returns, the common dividend was increased by 4.7% in the first quarter and paid in early April. With that as context, let's open up the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Tom. I mean I think, as you and I have talked before at least, we try and take a look at our capital position using our sophisticated economic capital I know it's not just the RBC ratios. We don't - just to be clear to your specific question. We don't publish and have not published the RBC ratio for this quarter, and so I'm not in a position to take you through the bits and pieces on this call. I think directionally, you and others have noted what the RBC impacts would be. But I think it's more important to think about the way that we manage capital and the way that we look at it on a comprehensive basis, not just and RBC basis. And I think you've seen reflected in the results that we continue to proactively manage our overall capital position. So again, I go back to our economic capital model, the sophisticated and comprehensive way that we look at capital, including all different sources and uses, and feel confident in our capital position being, as I said in my prepared remarks, above our internal targeted levels."

            "content": "Good morning. We're excited for Mark, and we're completely confident that Brent is going to give you everything you need to help you decide how and why you want to invest in Allstate. So good morning. We appreciate the investment of your time in Allstate today. Let's start with an overview results, and then Mario and Jess are going to walk through the operating results and the actions that we're taking to increase shareholder value. So let's start on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy, as you know, has two components, increased personal property-liability market share and expand protection services. Those are shown in the two ovals on the left. If you go to the right-hand side of the slide, you can see a summary of the results for the first quarter. We had a net loss of $346 million in the first quarter, which reflects a property liability underwriting loss which was only partially offset by strong investment income and profits from protection services and health and benefits. We're making good progress on executing the comprehensive plans to improve auto insurance profitability, and of course, we'll have a substantive discussion on that today. Not to be overlooked, we also continue to advance Transformative Growth plan, which is to execute the top oval there, which is to increase Property-Liability market share. At the same time, Allstate Protection Plans in the lower oval continues to expand its product offering and geographic footprint. Let's review the financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $13.8 billion in the first quarter increased 11.8% or nearly $1.5 billion as compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, resulting in Property-Liability earned premium growth of 10.8%. In the auto insurance line, higher insurance premiums and lower expenses were essentially offset by increased loss costs, so the profit improvement plan has not yet returned margins to historical levels. The auto insurance line had an underwriting loss of $346 million in the quarter. In homeowners, the story is really about $1.7 billion of catastrophes, which led to an underwriting loss of $534 million. The total underwriting loss was just under $1 billion. Net investment income of $575 million benefited from higher yields, which mostly offset an income decline from performance-based investments. Protection Services and Health and Benefits generated adjusted net income of $90 million in the quarter. As a result, the adjusted net loss was $342 million or $1.30 a share. Now let me turn it over to Mario to discuss Property-Liability results. I'll get Mario to dig in on claim expenses. When you look at the 5.7%, I'll remind you -- first, good morning, Greg. I'll remind you that remember, this is a number that's been trending up as the rates that we took in '21 and '22 start to be earned in. So we would expect that number to continue to increase as we earn in the rates we've already implemented, and so we think this. In terms of claims severity, I'll let Mario give you an update on where we are and what we're thinking about. So Greg, I think embedded in your question is, will you be challenged on something above 6.9%? The strategy that [Guy Hill] and team put into place was take 6.9% -- get 6.9%, don't have to have a consumer advocate come in and look at it, get another 6.9% and then go for the full rate. So what you're seeing us do it in three chunks. Other people have tried to do it other ways. We think this is the right way for us. Paul, you're breaking up a little bit, so let me just make sure I get it. So we're talking about auto insurance severity trends first quarter versus -- is that a tick up from what you saw last year? Or is it the level on? If that's the question, I'll just -- Mario can jump into that. Yes. Paul, I think there's a little bit of -- I mean, when you're looking at the percentages, it gets a little confusing when you're in a high increase environment. So if you looked at the numbers that Mario was talking about, are the percentages up versus the full year of 2022, not versus the first quarter of last year. As you know, the percentages kept going up as we move throughout the year and we adjusted our results, so what we've decided to do is to talk about the percentages up versus the full year. And I think, Mario, it is -- said it well, which is it continues to be high. And so we're trying to -- if you look at the percentage up versus what we thought it was in the first quarter, it would be higher than 10% to 11%, but it's not higher than what we thought the first quarter was at the end of last year. So as it relates to pricing, we're looking at just total loss cost frequency and severity, and we have to -- we believe we have to continue to increase prices this year. As Mario talked about, we were up almost 17% in the Allstate brand last year. I don't know. We don't have a target for what it will be this year. As Mario said, it's going to be what it needs to be. Elyse thanks for the question. Let me provide a little overview and then Jess will jump into the specifics. The headline would be, we don't just look at RBC. And so as Jess said, so -- I mean, if you step back and say, what are the learnings from the recent bank failures? Having a capital problem is not something that just happens to you like an auto accident [ph], right? It's a result of a series of choices made over time. So in terms of our series of choices, we had this really comprehensive set of processes around those choices that are highly analytical. We look at all kinds of scenarios. We look at it frequently, and as a result of that, we come up with what we think the right amount of capital. It includes things like RBC it includes things, like the rating agencies it includes. In some cases, we are more restrictive in terms of the amount of capital we think we need than other people. So we don't play the game of RBC arbitrage, so to speak, and fool ourselves. With that, Jess, do you want to talk about how you think about capital and where we're at? But you shouldn't take the fact that we have less equity as a statement that we thought we needed to save capital. We have less public equity holdings, because we didn't think it was a good risk return trade-off, which John [ph] will be happy to talk about it if somebody wants to go through. But we think we have plenty of capital on this business. Well, first, we think the profit improvement plan is working. I would say, Elyse, that if you just summarize the first quarter, I would say we held serve, we held serve in the face of, if you're a tennis fan, 120-mile an hour serve, which was called continued high increase in severity. How will - we'll return the ball, and as you point out, it's about where it was last year. It is improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, but you're absolutely right. Yes, there were some other things going around in the fourth quarter related to the first, second and third quarter of last year. So it's not quite fair to say that it improved. I would just say we held serve. We feel good about where we're going. In our mind, it's a question of when, not if we will get back to how we make profitability. And that's, of course, dependent on what happens with inflation and costs. Yaron, I'm not exactly sure. Maybe you can give me another layer down in the question so we can get specific for you? Yes. No, it's a good point. Let me get John to answer that. I'll give you a little overview [ph]. First, I would just say analytics everywhere. It counts for everyone despite. So whether that's using sophisticated models is that where they toll the car or extending duration or what we're doing with capital. And so, when we look at the extension of duration, I think John ran like nine different scenarios, how to do it, what to do it, what and - so we're all over that. When it comes to stress events in the capital markets, we look at all kinds of alternatives there. Everything from -- and what do we do with the government defaults to what do we do if there's more bank failures. And so we have - and John can tell you sort, of how he's thinking about how we allocate assets in the portfolio relative to stress events in today's market. I would say from an overall capital standpoint, which is we got plenty of money. Like you saw our liabilities, they're very predictable, and so nobody is going to run in and say give us back our $10 billion and we don't have it. At the same time, we have a really highly liquid portfolio, because so much of it's in investment-grade fixed income. If it's fixed - investment-grade fixed income market is completely shut down, we would still probably be fine. Right now probably we would be fine, because we're having cash come in terms of unearned premiums every day, so we don't really have any overall liquidity issues. But in terms of capital market stress and how you think about that from an investment decisions and where we're invested today, John can give you some perspective. Where is, the plan at the beginning of the year. So maybe I'll give an overview, Mario, with an analogy and you can bear. We're running as fast and as hard as we can on rates everywhere. If we need them, we're really running fast and hard. If we think, we're actually adequately priced in some states where we are today, we're still paying attention. We're still on the track. We're so warmed up and ready to run if we need to be. Andrew thanks for focusing in on National General. For summary, we feel really good about the acquisition of National General. If you just start with the math, the numbers, it's exceeded our expectations and assumptions, because as you'll remember, we've mostly bought that so we could reduce our expenses in the independent agent channel by folding, basically having them reverse acquire Encompass, we just happen to buy them first. And so they've - and that's ahead of plan and the numbers are bigger. So, we're feeling really good about that, and that's the way we price the deal. You're - strategically, which is where you're after, we're also getting the benefit of now having a solid plan for an independent agent channel, which we did not before. We've been struggling to get a good platform so they have good technology, good relationships, as you point out, mostly in the nonstandard stuffing. Mario, I think in his comments, mentioned how we're now taking those relationships and that technology platform and we're putting what we call mid-market, which is basically standard auto and homeowners, on that platform, and that's going to give us great growth opportunities because we're using the Allstate expertise in both standard auto and - not to be underestimated, one bit really is our business model and homeowners. We think that's a great growth opportunity and which is basically icing on the cake relative to the acquisition. So, we feel really good about we're in that channel. It's part of Transformative Growth. It's part of increasing market share and personal profit liability, and we're pleased with the results. Good. Mario, why don't you talk about homeowners and what we're doing there to drive growth? As it relates to auto insurance, we just talked about sort of the Allstate brand, I think, which may be the numbers you're referring to, which is down versus Andrew's comment about National General, which is off. On the Allstate piece, there's, obviously two components. One is, are you selling more new business? And then the second is what's happening with retention. And as it relates to new business, we've taken the approach that a prospective rate increase is like a new business penalty. So as you know, when you sell a business, you're going to have - you got expenses. It is getting the customers more to get them right in front, and then the loss ratio is typically higher for new business than it is for existing business. If you need 10 points of rate on top of what you're currently selling it to, we've factored that into our growth projections on new business and said, well this -- at the very least, it's an additional 10 points of new business penalty. The worst is that when you raise your prices by 10%, all the money you spent getting the customer is wasted, because they go away and you churn it. So we've dialed back new business and advertising not so much, because we're trying to manage the P&L, but because we're managing the economic growth. And we think needing rate increases and going out and getting a new customer and saying, it's great, you bought it for $1,000. And then six months later saying, well, it was really $1,100 is not a good plan. So we've dialed back new business, and you see that really across the board. And Mario showed in some places, even more aggressively, like New York, New Jersey, and California have kidded Mario that like, you'll know every new business customer we get in New York if we keep this up personally. So that's basically an economic choice. On retention, of course, that's the customer's choice and it depends what happens in the marketplace and what other people are doing. Our retention has gone down. We do model that out. It's really very difficult to take those old models, so -- and give yourself any kind of good estimate on the current view because a couple of things have changed. One, these are much bigger increases than those models had in them. So those models are based on 5%, 6%, 7%, not on 10%, 12% or 15% or 14% [ph] in Texas. And at the same time, those models don't have the kind of competitive environment you're operating in where everybody else is raising rates at the same time. So we've shutdown new business, because we think it's economic and there's an increased new business penalty associated with being underpriced, and then we're managing to. What we want to do, of course, is we're highly focused on improving customer value, because people pay more, you got to do more for them. And so, we're working hard on making sure we do insurance reviews, get our agents for them [ph] homeowners is another great story that I think we've kind of - we get so focused on auto. We haven't really put - it's a great business model. Mario can talk about what we're doing to grow that business. So let me just double click on the Transformative Growth piece. So the third piece of Transformative Growth is to increase the sophistication and investment in customer acquisition. We think we can and should be able to get new customers cheaper than we do today. There's lots of math we have around that. One of those is telematics, so we were the first out there with continuous telematics. We've been at it for over a decade. We're now taking telematics, and with Arity, we now think we can take telematics into new business, Brian. And actually, not have to have them download our app or put a device in their car to figure out how good a drive they are. We think we can use our sophisticated analytics to price them using telematics ahead of time, which will maybe -- to better manage your acquisition cost. So lots of work to go there, so plenty of opportunity to grow. Let me finish and make sure we respect for people's time on that question. So first, when you look at overall inflation, the numbers Fed and everybody else sees, that's one set of numbers. If you look at the inflation in what we do, it's of course, dramatically higher. And those are subject to different things. So whether the Fed tightens the economy, it doesn't tighten economy, probably isn't going to do a lot to keep people from having severe accidents, hurting themselves and needing a lot of medical care or then more lawyers getting involved in the case, nor will it have a huge impact on what the OEs charge on parts. They tend to charge more in parts based on what they're doing to overall profitability and how many new cars are selling. So if we go into a recession, they sell new cars, I don't expect they're going to cut car's prices. So we think inflation will persist in this business at a higher level than you see from the overall CPI, and that's why we're having to raise prices for our customers. Thank you all for participating today. Thank you for being generous with your time. We're going a few minutes over. Our priorities, make sure we're going to make money in auto insurance and continue to leverage our superior position in homeowners as start to grow and execute Transformative Growth, whether that's by getting our costs down, rolling out new products, expanding our National General platform. And then we didn't spend any time today on the great stories we have in the lower oval, which is expanding Protection Services. So a lot of things we're working on hard to create more value for you. Thank you, and we'll see you next quarter."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's flip to Slide 4. The chart on the left shows the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio since 2017. As you can see, Allstate has a long history of generating strong underwriting results though the current operating environment is challenging, with combined ratios over 100 last year and into the first quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.3 for the first quarter was slightly below the full year 2022. The second chart compares the full year 2022 recorded combined ratio for all lines of business to the first quarter of this year, which removes the influence of intra-year severity changes that occurred throughout 2022. The first red bar shows the underlying loss ratio was essentially unchanged as higher premiums were offset by increased loss costs. The second red bar on the left shows most of the increase in the combined ratio was driven by higher catastrophe losses, reflecting the widespread severe weather in the first quarter of this year. Expenses were lower by 1.9 points of premiums and minimal non-catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates also had a positive impact. Let's move to Slide 5 to review Allstate's auto insurance profitability in more detail. As you can see from the chart on the left, which shows the auto insurance recorded and underlying combined ratios from 2017 through the current quarter, we have a long history of sustained profitability in auto insurance as we successfully leveraged our capabilities and pricing sophistication, underwriting and claims expertise and expense management to generate excellent returns in the auto insurance business. Since mid-2021, loss costs have increased rapidly, driving combined ratios above our mid-90s target. The profit improvement plan is designed to address these significant loss cost increases, and we're making good progress. The chart on the right compares the recorded combined ratio of 104.4 in the first quarter to full year 2022 results. Starting on the left, higher average earned premiums drove a 5.7 point favorable impact, which is shown in the first green bar. The first red bar reflects a 6.5 point increase in underlying loss cost due to increased accident frequency and severity for the 2023 report year, with severity currently projected in the 9% to 11% range above the full prior report year. A lower expense ratio reflects expense reductions and higher earned premiums. The remaining difference was due to catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates. All in, both the recorded and underlying combined ratios of 104.4 and 102.6, respectively, improved in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022. Slide 6 provides an update on the execution of our comprehensive approach to increase returns in auto insurance. There are four focus areas, raising rates, reducing expenses, implementing underwriting actions and enhancing claim practices to manage loss costs. Starting with rates. Following increases of 16.9% in 2022, the Allstate brand implemented an additional 1.7% of rate increases in the first quarter. We will continue to pursue rate increases in 2023 to restore auto insurance margins. Reducing operating expenses is core to Transformative Growth. We have also temporarily reduced advertising to reflect a lower appetite for new business. We implemented more restrictive underwriting actions on new business in locations and risk segments where we have not yet achieved adequate prices for the risk. As we move through 2023, it is likely that some of these restrictions will be removed where there are profitable growth opportunities. Enhancing claim practices in a high inflation environment is key to delivering customer value. This includes leveraging strategic partnerships and scale with repair facilities and parts suppliers to mitigate the cost of repairing vehicles. In addition, settlement of pending bodily injury claims has been accelerated to avoid continued increases in costs and settlements. Transitioning to Slide 7. Let's discuss progress in three large states with a disproportionate impact on auto profitability. The table depicts Allstate brand auto new business production and rate actions for California, New York and New Jersey. As a result of implemented profitability actions, new issued applications from the combination of California, New York and New Jersey declined by 40% compared to the prior year quarter. The decline in these three states meaningfully contributed to the 22% decline countrywide. The right-hand portion of the table provides rate increases either taken or needed to improve margins. In California, we just received approval for a second 6.9% rate increase implemented in April, which will be effective in June. We continue to work closely with the California Department on the best path forward to getting rates to an adequate level and expect to file for an additional increase in the second quarter, which will reflect the balance of our full rate need. In New York, we filed for additional rate in the first quarter that is currently pending with the Department of Financial Services. In New Jersey, we attained a 6.9% rate increase in the first quarter and expect to pursue additional filings in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we anticipate implementing additional rates across the country into 2023 to counteract persistent loss cost increases. Slide 8 dives deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. The chart on the left shows the property liability underwriting expense ratio over time and highlights drivers of the 2.9 points of improvement in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first green bar on the left shows the 2 point improvement impact from advertising spend, which has been reduced given a limited interest in new business at current rate levels. The last two green bars show a decline in operating and distribution costs mainly driven by lower agent and employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums. Shifting to our longer-term target on the right, we remain on pace to reducing the adjusted expense ratio to 23 by year-end 2024 as part of transformative growth. This metric starts with our underwriting expense ratio excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate. Through innovation and strong execution, we've driven significant improvement relative to 2018, with first quarter adjusted expense ratio of 24.9. We expect to drive additional improvement, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by the end of next year by represents a 6-point reduction compared to 2018. The increase in average premiums certainly represents a tailwind, however, our intent in establishing the goal is to become more price competitive. This requires a sustainable reduction in our cost structure, with future focus on three principal areas, including enhancing digitization and automation capabilities, improving operating efficiency through outsourcing, business model rationalization and centralized support, and enabling higher growth distribution at lower costs through changes in agency compensation structure and new agent models. Now let's move to Slide 9 to review homeowner insurance results, which incurred an underwriting loss in the quarter despite favorable underlying performance due to elevated catastrophe losses. We have a superior business model that includes differentiated product, underwriting, reinsurance and a claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. As you can see by the chart on the left, this approach consistently generates industry-leading underwriting results despite quarterly or yearly fluctuations in catastrophe losses. The chart on the right shows key Allstate Protection homeowners insurance operating statistics for the first quarter. Net written premium increased 11.1% from the prior year quarter, predominantly driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 1.4% increase in policies in force. The first quarter homeowners combined ratio of 119 increased by 35.1 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher catastrophe losses primarily related to five large wind events in March. These accounted for more than 70% of catastrophe losses in the quarter. The first quarter catastrophe loss ratio was significantly elevated compared to the prior year and 10-year historical average by 36.2 and 30.5 points, respectively. The underlying combined ratio of 67.6 improved 0.4 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium and a lower expense ratio partially offset by higher claim severity. Slide 10 provides an update on Transformative Growth. Transformative Growth remains a focus and is being executed in parallel with our profit improvement actions. We continue to make good progress on this multiyear initiative that spans five main components: improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, modernizing the technology ecosystem and driving organizational transformation. The bottom half of the slide highlights recent progress by intended outcome. Providing the lowest cost insurance through expense reductions, broad distribution and pricing sophistication is key to growth. Our Allstate brand relative competitive position has deteriorated recently as rate increases have exceeded some competitors. We expect that those competitors will eventually raise rates, improving our competitive position and growth prospects. Distribution has been expanded by launching middle market and preferred products through independent agents under the National General brand. These products are currently available in approximately 25% of the U.S. market, with a plan to be in nearly every market by the end of next year. Our new affordable, simple and connected auto product creates a differentiated customer experience, which is expected to become available in approximately one-third of the U.S. through the direct distribution channel by the end of this year, deploying a new technology stack, integrating technology across brands and retiring legacy technology applications provides increased agility and lowers costs. This will be reflected in the sunset of the Esurance and Encompass technology platforms next year. We believe transformative growth will lead to increased market share, and hence, higher company valuation multiples. And now, I'll turn it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results. Yes. Good morning, Greg. So in terms of claims severity, what we disclosed this quarter was across major coverages. We're running in the 9% to 11% range in both physical damage and in injury coverages. Really, the drivers of those costs, if you start with physical damage, we continue to see pretty persistent inflation particularly in parts and labor costs to repair cars. Actually, used car prices or total values for used cars actually came down a little bit in the first quarter in our numbers, but we had a higher percentage of total loss frequency which impacted the mix, so those are really the drivers. And on bodily injury, it's the same things we've been talking about. Medical inflation, medical consumption and attorney representation. So I think the drivers of severity continue to persist. In terms of where they're going forward, it's really anybody's guess, but I think our perspective is, and we've been pretty consistent on this point, we're going to continue to take prices up. We've been doing that really since the fourth quarter of 2021 throughout last year. That continued into the first quarter. We're going to continue to, on a forward-looking basis, implement rate increases to first catch up and then outpace loss cost trends. But our perspective on rates as we continue to need to push more price through the system, and we intend to do that throughout the balance of 2023. Sure. So first I'll start with -- as we talked about, we just got approval for a second 6.9% auto rate increase in California, so we're -- going back to the fourth quarter of last year, we've got approval for 2 6.9% rates, and we've done that by working closely with the department to lay out our data and our loss costs. In those conversations, and I think you've seen some of this across the industry, the department is really encouraging carriers to file for the rate need that they have in their book as opposed to going forward with 6.9% rate increase filings, and it's really based on just the volume of rate filings they're getting. So as we talk to the commissioner and the department, we got -- we're able to secure approval for the two 6.9% rate increases, and we intend on filing the balance of our rate need going forward. Does that create risk in intervention? It does. But I think we need to get California auto prices back to where they need to be so that we can create the kind of availability for consumers, really, that they deserve in California. So we're going to work with the department closely, we're going to make that filing, and then we'll see where that takes us going forward. Yes. We got some rate filings pending with the New York department that hopefully will get resolved soon. And then New Jersey, you see, we were able to implement a rate increase and we're going to come back and file another rate increase. So we're working hard to get these three states off of this page. Yes. I guess what I would say about severity, again, in that 9% to 11% range is it just remains persistently high, I think, is how I would describe it, and that's true across coverages. It's certainly lower than what our expectations were for severity last year, what our ultimate forecast is for 2022. But it still remains at elevated levels, which is why I go back to we're going to need to continue to push rate through the system through the balance of this year to combat that inflation. Yes. What I would add Yaron, I'm going to go back to a comment I made earlier, which is we've been pretty consistent on this point of the need to take prices up going back to last year, and that hasn't changed. Now obviously, we react to new data, new information in real-time and the absolute amount of rate we take is going to be dependent on that updated data. As Tom mentioned earlier, we rely on heavy-duty analytics to manage the business and we respond to what's happening in real time, so the amount of rate we need will be dependent on how loss costs play out over time for us. But we're going to continue to push rate through the system. We've been successful at that. I wouldn't get too hung up on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations because that quarterly number is going to bounce around in terms of the rates that were approved in a particular state, and the size of those rates. But I think thematically, I'm going to go back to what we've been saying now for -- over the last year, which is we're going to continue to take the rate that we need to get auto margins back to where they need to be, which is in the mid-90s targets that we have. Thank you. Hi Andrew, it's Mario. Thanks for the question. I guess what I'd start with, there's, a number of indices for used car prices. I think you mentioned one with Manheim that tends to focus on wholesale prices. And I think as we all know, that metric was coming down most of last year. Certainly in the back half of last year, and then it started to tick up in the end of the fourth quarter and has continued into this year. What I was referring to earlier is actual total loss severity, which tends to lag the Manheim Index and is more a function of retail used car prices, which have improved, and that's what I was referring to in the quarter. What we saw was actually used car - or I'm sorry, total loss severity actually improved a little bit year-over-year. In terms of the risk going forward, I think, yes. If you look at what's happening with the Manheim Index and other indices. Certainly, they're headed in a different direction than they were headed for much of last year, which adds risk. We've tried to factor that into our severity expectations in terms of what we're recording that 9% to 11% range. But what we actually saw in the first quarter of this year was a modest improvement in total loss severity. Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. And homeowners, again, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, is a business that we continue to feel really good about in terms of where it's positioned from a profitable growth perspective. And what you saw in the quarter is that we actually increased policy count by about 1.4%. Retention actually picked up by a temp. And I think there's a couple of things when you kind of unpack what's happening with retention in homeowners because much -- as Tom talked about, we're having to take prices up in auto. The way we're taking price increases is in a highly segmented and targeted way, and that's helping from a retention perspective on homeowners because those bundled customers tend to be our longest-tenured, most profitable customers. We also bundle about 80% of homeowners' policies have on supporting auto line and the retention on a bundled customer where a homeowner that has an auto policy is meaningfully higher than a monoline homeowners, and we're continuing to see the benefit of that. And we've put processes in place both in terms of economic incentives for our agents and sales processes in the call centers on the direct side to incent additional bundling. And we're seeing some nice trends in terms of bundling rates, which is certainly helping homeowner growth through homeowner retention. We're going to continue to look for ways to grow the homeowner business. We think it provides a really compelling risk and return opportunity for us. The results are going to bounce around because there's volatility. This quarter is an example of that with catastrophe losses, but we continue to see our underlying combined ratio and loss ratio improve, and both through leveraging the tactics I talked about for retention production, particularly with bundled customers, we think we can continue to grow that line. Yes, we're obviously quoting bundled customers right now. And when you look at the business we are writing, we're seeing really nice improvements in terms of quality and lifetime value, which is indicative of that bundling rate. And so yes, we're quoting it. And the other thing you got to remember, and this is true both from a retention and a new business perspective. Bundling, it's an easier experience and a more streamlined experience for customers. There's discounts associated with bundling as well that can help offset higher auto rates and incent customers to stay with us. Yes, Brian, this is Mario. Thanks for the question. Again, expenses as much as Tom talked earlier about, earned premium and loss ratio, we kind of held serve there. We did see the benefit of a lower expense ratio both in terms of the underwriting expense ratio and the adjusted expense ratio. Where we're at in the kind of continuum on the adjusted expense ratio, we set a goal to get that adjusted ratio down to about 23 by the end of 2024. And we're making really good progress on that, you saw continued progress on that this quarter. We certainly are being helped by higher earned premium which leveraged our cost. But we're continuing to see reductions in both operating costs and distribution-related costs, which are helping the expense ratio. And I talked a little bit earlier about the areas we're focused on, whether it's automation, digitization, sourcing and continuing to drive both operating and distribution costs down. We're going to -- those are really going to be the levers we pull to push the expense ratio ultimately to that goal that we set with Transformative Growth. So we're making good progress, feel really good about that. In terms of the level of marketing spend, certainly, we spent less this quarter on marketing than we did a year ago, and we've pulled that back. I think as Tom said earlier, really from an economic risk and return perspective, it doesn't make a lot of sense for us to invest aggressively in marketing at a time when our prices aren't adequate. But what we will do over time has more rates and -- or, I'm sorry, more states and more markets get to a rate level that we're comfortable with, we're going to surgically lean in. And as one of the components of Transformative Growth, we're going to look to both increase the level and the sophistication of the marketing investment that we make. And that will be commensurate with what we think the opportunity is to grow, so I can't sit here today and give you a specific dollar amount or our target that we're focused on. That's why we gave you the adjusted expense ratio, which excludes marketing costs because we're going to continue to invest in marketing when it makes economic sense and where it makes economic sense for us to lean in."

After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please be aware this call is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Alastair Gobin, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAlastair Gobin: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team will provide perspective on our strategy and an update on our results. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2023 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Good morning. We appreciate you investing your time in understanding the value creation potential at Allstate. I'm going to provide an overview of results. Mario and Jess will walk through the operating performance, and then we'll address your questions. So let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy has two components, increased personal Property-Liability market share, and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. We now have more than 200 million policies in force. On the right hand side, you can see Allstate's performance for the third quarter. Total revenues of $16.6 billion were up 14.7%, compared to the prior year quarter. Allstate generated net income of $1.2 billion and adjusted net income of $3.91 per share. Return on equity was 26.1% over the last 12 months. The Property-Liability business, is now positioned for growth. Execution of the auto profit improvement plan has restored auto margins, near term auto insurance policy growth will require us to improve customer retention and increase new business levels, both of which Mario will discuss. The homeowners business had good returns and is growing. The transformative growth initiatives, to build a low cost digital insurer with affordable, simple and connected protection, will ensure that this growth is sustainable. Proactive investing also benefited income as the decision to lengthen duration at the right time increased portfolio yields. In addition, higher insurance prices, and increased reserve levels create a much larger investment portfolio, which also raises income. Protection plans continues to profitably grow, and we recently did a small acquisition to expand mobile device protection capabilities. Let's move to Slide 3. Here you can see the operational execution generated excellent financial results. Revenues increased to $16.6 billion. As you can see in the upper left, Property-Liability earned premiums were up 11.6%. Net investment income for the quarter was $783 million that's 13.6% higher than the prior year quarter. Net income was $1.16 billion. Adjusted net income as I mentioned was $3.91 per share. And then, you can see in the lower right that the return on equity was 26.1%. This shows that Allstate's operational excellence enabled us to dramatically improve results from last year. Now let's hear from Mario on Property-Liability results.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Before I go into my remarks on the quarter, I want to call out a change we made to our disclosures. You'll notice that we simplified our Protection segment disclosures this quarter, to focus on product and channel instead of brand. For the past several years, we've provided detail on both the Allstate and National General brands separately, to create transparency into National General's performance and allow you to evaluate the acquisition. National General has been a highly successful acquisition, since it is now twice its size, generates excellent returns and gives us strong competitive positions in both independent agent distribution and non-standard auto risk. We're now building on this success by combining operations, such as expanding the sale of non-standard business under the Allstate brand. As a result, performance should be evaluated for the protection business in total, and by distribution channel versus by brand and that's why we made the change. So in keeping with this approach, my commentary today will be focused on performance on total auto and homeowner lines, and production by distribution channel. With that as background, let's start on Slide 4. On the top of the table on the left, you can see Property-Liability premiums of $13.7 billion, increased 11.6% in the third quarter driven by higher average premiums. Underwriting income of $495 million improved by $909 million, compared to the prior year quarter, as improved underlying margins more than offset higher catastrophes. The expense ratio of 21.5 was 0.3 points higher than prior year, due to increased advertising. As we continue to accelerate growth investments in rate adequate states and risk segments. The chart on the right depicts the components of the 96.4 combined ratio. The loss ratio shown in light blue includes losses of $1.7 billion and was 2.8 points higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 83.2 in dark blue improved by 8.7 points, compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by higher average earned premium, and improved loss cost strengths. Prior year reserve reestimates excluding catastrophes had only a minor impact on current quarter results, as favorable development in personal auto and homeowners insurance, was more than offset by increases in personal umbrella and runoff business, primarily related to asbestos related claims, which was recorded this quarter, as a result of our annual third quarter discontinued lines reserve review. Now let's dive deeper into auto insurance margins on Slide 5, where you can see the success of the auto profit improvement plan. The third quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 94.8 improved by 7.3 points, compared to the prior year quarter as average earned premiums outpaced loss costs. Average underlying loss in expense was 4.8% above prior year quarter, reflecting higher current year incurred severity estimates, primarily driven by bodily injury coverage offset by lower accident frequency, as well as higher advertising investments to drive new business growth. Physical damage severity increases continue to moderate, while bodily injury severity continues to trend above broader inflation indices. Our claims team continues to focus on operational actions, to mitigate the impact of inflationary trends. As a reminder, we regularly review claim severity expectations throughout the year. If the expected severity for the current year changes, we record the year-to-date impact in the current quarter, even though a portion of that impact is attributable to previous quarters. For 2022 and 2023, the bars in the graph reflect the updated average severity estimates, as of the end of each of those years to remove the volatility, related to intra-year severity adjustments. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2024, the full year claim severity estimate went down, so there was a benefit from prior quarters included in the third quarter's reported results. This benefit was worth 0.8 points in the third quarter, with the adjusted quarterly combined ratio of 95.6 as shown on the far right bar. Now let's review homeowners insurance on Slide 6, which generates attractive returns and growth opportunities. Allstate is an industry leader in homeowners insurance, generating a low 90s combined ratio over the last 10 years. As you can see in the chart on the left, this performance compares favorably to the industry, which experienced an underwriting loss and a combined ratio of 103 over the same time period. Moving to the table on the right, Allstate Protection homeowners written premium increased by 10.8%, compared to prior year reflecting higher average gross written premium per policy, and policy enforced growth of 2.5%. The third quarter combined ratio of 98.2 resulted in $60 million of underwriting income, compared to a $131 million loss in the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 62.1 improved by 10.8 points, due to higher average premium and lower non-catastrophe loss costs. For the first nine months of 2024, homeowners insurance generated an underwriting profit of $249 million, despite $1.2 billion of catastrophe losses in in the third quarter. Let me provide insight into the growth potential of the Property-Liability business starting on Slide 7. In the chart on the left, you see the composition of the Property-Liability book. Homeowners in medium blue represents approximately 20% of policies in force. Homeowners' insurance policies in force increased by 2.5% as retention has improved by close to half a point, compared to last year and new issued applications are close to 20% above prior year. As you can see in the right hand column. We view homeowners as a growth opportunity. Auto policies in the dark blue account for approximately two-thirds of Property-Liability policies enforced. As you can see on the right side of the page, overall policies enforce declined by 1.5%. This reflects a decline in customer retention to 84.7%, which is 2/10th of a point below the prior year quarter, but much lower than historical levels. We did have a 26% increase in new issued applications, which offset some of the retention losses. Now let's go through each of these components to give you insight into how to assess growth prospects. Let's start with customer retention on Slide 8. This chart shows Allstate brand auto insurance retention over a 10-year period which is primarily standard auto insurance risks. There is a couple of key points I want to make on this slide. First, raising prices leads to lower retentions as customers shop for other options. Second, the large increases in the last several years have led to a significant decline in retention since 2022, which has negatively impacted policies in force. This has, however, recently leveled off as price increases have moderated. Let's look at the three periods with the arrows. In 2015 and 2016, we raised auto insurance prices, which you can see from the dotted line because of an increase in the frequency of accidents. The graph shows how this led to lag declines in retention from 88.2 in 2014 to 86.7 in 2017. Over the next three years, price increases were relatively modest and retention recovered reaching 88.3 by 2019. Now, there are lots of factors impacting retention, such as the amount of new business you write, the risk type of that business, number of bundled policies and specific actions taken in big states like California and Florida, as well as customer satisfaction levels. But the biggest driver is price. Increased advertising and price competition had a modest negative impact over the next several years with retention hovering around 87%. You can see this in the most recent period where retention has declined by 2.7 points over the last 10 quarters, which reflected rate increases of 36% on a cumulative basis. Looking forward, we expect lower rate increases given the profitability of auto insurance. This year, for example, Allstate brand rates have been increased by 6.3% compared to 9.5% in the first nine months of last year. Lower price increases should translate into higher retention. To help you model this out, every point of retention is worth approximately 350,000 policies enforced each and every year, or 1.4% of the current policy count. Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss the success we've had in increasing new business levels this year. We continue to invest in transformative growth while we executed the profit improvement plan. These foundational investments enable us to go to market with a multichannel distribution strategy that serves customers based on their personal preferences and has resulted in a 26% increase in new business in the third quarter shown in the far right column at the bottom. While profit actions previously restricted our new business appetite, rate adequacy has now been achieved in the vast majority of states. Third quarter advertising spend was roughly 60% higher than the same quarter in 2021. In the Allstate agency channel, the compensation structure was also changed to improve growth and agent productivity at lower distribution costs. Allstate Agency new business was up 16% over the prior year quarter with bundling rates at point of sale at all-time highs. The national general acquisition enabled us to grow independent agency new business by 14% over the prior year quarter. In the direct channel, we are back to 2022 levels with fewer underwriting restrictions, increased advertising and the new affordable, simple and connected auto product which is currently available in 25 states. New business is 56% over prior year and we expect to increase to continue increasing volume in this channel which now represents 31% of total auto new business. This level of new business will drive future growth. Every 5% increase in new issued applications above the current run rate increases policies enforce by approximately 250,000 items or 1% of policies in force. Looking forward, the property liabilities business is positioned for growth. Margins are attractive, fewer rate increases should improve retention and the components of transformative growth are working, including new products, increased advertising, lower expenses and expanded distribution. This will enable us to achieve our strategic goal of increased Property-Liability market share. And now, I'll turn it over to Jess.\nJess Merten: Thank you, Mario. Let's shift to Slide 10 to review investment performance. A proactive approach to portfolio management that optimizes return per unit of risk across the enterprise generated strong returns this quarter. Our disciplined approach includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, interest rates and credit spreads. The chart on the left shows the fixed income, portfolio yield and assets under management trend over the last several years. Fixed income yield shown with the orange line has steadily increased as we repositioned into higher yielding longer duration assets. Based on interest rates in the third quarter our fixed income yield is now generally in line with market yields. In the gray bars you can see growth in the portfolio book value. Since the fourth quarter of 2021, book value has increased by 14% or $9.1 billion, reflecting the impact of higher underwriting cash flows attributable to increased premiums and reserve levels as well as portfolio cash flows that increased because of higher coupon rates. Growth in assets and higher yields benefited net investment income as shown in the chart on the right. Net Investment income totaled $783 million in the quarter, which is $94 million above the third quarter of last year. Market based income of $708 million, which is shown in blue, was $141 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact of a fixed income yield that is 60 basis points above the third quarter last year. Performance based income of $143 million shown in black was $43 million below the prior year quarter, reflecting lower real estate investment results. While this quarter's result is lower than our long term expectation, our returns continue to be strong and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected. Slide 11 highlights strong results in the protection plans business, which is one of the five companies in the protection services segment that also includes Arity, Roadside, dealer Services and identity protection. The Protection Plans business provides warranties for consumer electronics, computers and tablets, TVs, mobile phones, major appliances and furniture through strong domestic and international retail distribution relationships. Revenues for this business totaled $512 million in the third quarter and increased 23.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting growth in international markets. Profitable growth resulted in adjusted net income of $39 million, a $19 million increase compared to the prior year quarter, as strong operational execution increased margins and enabled successful implementation of the strategy to expand distribution relationships and product offerings. We continue to invest in this fast growing business. In October, Allstate Protection Plans acquired Kingfisher to enhance capabilities in mobile phone protection. Now let's Transition to Slide 12 to focus on the terms and accounting treatment of the sale of the Employer Voluntary Benefits business. As we announced in August, Allstate finalized an agreement to sell the Employer Voluntary Benefits business, which I will also refer to as the EVB business for a purchase price of $2 billion to StanCorp Financial. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approvals. As a reminder, the EVB sale is the first step in a strategic decision to pursue divestiture of the Employer Voluntary Benefits, group health and individual health businesses to capture value through greater strategic alignment. The EVB transaction is economically and financially attractive for shareholders. Allstate retains the economics of the business until closing and results continue to be reflected in net income and adjusted net income. In the quarter $3.2 billion of assets and $2.2 billion of liabilities related to the EVB business have been classified as held for sale. As you can see on the right of the slide, we're estimating a $600 million gain and had previously disclosed that we expect the transaction to generate approximately $1.6 billion of capital. Moving to health and benefits results for the quarter, Premium and contract charges for the segment increased 5.2% for $24 million compared to the prior year quarter. The individual and group health businesses saw strong growth with premiums and contract charges up by 8.1% and 20.2% respectively. This growth was partially offset by a modest decrease in the EVB business. Adjusted net income for the segment of $37 million in the quarter was $32 million lower than the prior year quarter as increased benefit utilization across all three businesses impacted profitability, underwriting and rate actions are being taken to quickly address the benefit ratio trends and restore margins to historical levels. The process to evaluate disposition of the group and individual businesses is progressing. Let's wrap up with Slide 13 to recap Allstate's strategy and path to value creation. Operational excellence ensures that we react to changing business conditions and maintain margins at target levels. Transformative growth investments are being made to create sustainable growth and Allstate delivers attractive returns. With that as context, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first, just had a question around your confidence and outlook for PIF growth in the auto business, and what you're seeing in terms of competitor behavior, both on prices and on advertising. Seems like most competitors are - shifting to a growth mode now that margins have recovered. But are you confident that we can see PIF growth turn positive over the next few quarters?\nTom Wilson: Jimmy, let me make a couple of comments and Mario can jump in. First, we don't give growth projections, so we're not going to comment on that. We gave you. We put the numbers in there, so you can do your own analysis of how you think we'll do in retention, and how you think we'll do in new business. We obviously believe we can grow market share, which is what our whole strategy is about. When you look at the competitive environment, you continue to see progressive advertising aggressively GEICO has gotten back into the market, but perhaps not as aggressively as they have in the past. And State Farm continues to try to grow, but as you know, they have an underwriting profitability challenge that they're I suspect they will take out, but we'll only see. But I would also not just focus on those big players, but there's a whole bunch of other players that are more moderate size or smaller that either don't have the firepower in advertising to compete, or don't have the pricing sophistication. Mario, do you want to make comments about how you're feeling about growth?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. At its highest level, obviously to turn positive, PIF growth requires that we keep more of our existing customers, which is the retention component, and then we drive increased levels of new business. Maybe I'll talk about each of the pieces individually. Like we pointed out in the presentation, obviously a lot of the rate actions in the profit improvement plan that we've implemented over the last couple of years has had a pretty negative impact on customer retention. Now going forward, we would expect, just given where our margins are in auto, all other things being equal, we would expect to take less rate going forward, which will have a positive impact on retention, as it has in the past as we create less disruption in the book. But the other side of it is, we're not just going to rely on that. We've got actions in place in a number of areas, both in terms of improving the customer experience. Working with our customers, both through our agents, and our contact centers to help identify opportunities to improve affordability, and really kind of mitigate shopping activity from our own customers. So, we're focused on retention improving going forward, both kind of organically, I'll say through less rate, but we're also not sitting back. We're taking proactive actions to help offset some of the headwind that we've seen in retention. On the other side. On the new business standpoint, just to give you some context, we talked about the vast majority of markets being open for business somewhere between 75% and 80% of our premium volume. When you look at it nationally, those are markets that we are open for business. We're accelerating investments, and we've really seen some good production trends across all distribution channels. Our agents are productive, they're bundling at all-time high levels, which also will help retention. We believe over time we're continuing to see really good traction on the direct business and we think there's ongoing opportunity there. And then as I mentioned earlier, the National General acquisition and what we've been able to do both in the non-standard auto market, as well as in the independent agent space more broadly, is generating some good production trends. So, we feel good about that. We're focused on improving retention, while continuing to build on the growth momentum from a new business perspective, which has improved sequentially over the course of the year. And when those two things come together, that that's what will drive positive growth.\nTom Wilson: Jimmy, let me add just a couple of things. On a longer term perspective, what Mario talked about. So when auto profitability went negative, we said first priority, get the rate, don't be too specific about it. And what Mario is talking about is going back in now and saying, okay, well we got the total rate. How many more people should be using Milewise? How many more people should be using telematics? Those are great opportunities for us to leverage our innovation and keep more customers. So there's a bunch of good work going on there. So the priority that we gave to the team was we need to make money in auto insurance. We've done that. Now we're ready to go back in and, which should drive retention. The other thing I would say is on distribution. If you look at our historical growth, this is the first time really we have three fully functioning channels. Like, we've got three horses here, all ready to run. You can see the growth. And direct is up a lot this versus last year. But that's, because direct was the first place we shutdown, too. When it came to how do we get profitability up in auto insurance, we said well, first, if we're losing money on it, we shouldn't write it. Rather than take that hit in volume to the Allstate aging channel, which needs to be maintained in terms of its revenue and growth, we said, let's just do it to direct. So the direct bounce back, is just where we are now. But in that pause, we really built out our capability. So, we're feeling good about having three horses to drive growth.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on capital, obviously, your balance sheet's a lot stronger with the improved profitability. You've got the pending sale of the benefits business as well. How should we think about uses of capital, as profitability continues to recover and once the sale closes between sort of your priorities for acquisitions, potential buybacks, dividends?\nTom Wilson: A very appropriate question. I'll channel Jess for a minute here, and just say, we've always had a lot of capital. So I know not everybody believed that, but we've always been financially very strong. But as we think about capital, it is something we take very seriously. It's really one of the key things we do for shareholders, and we feel like we've been good stewards of that. As you look forward, we think the best and first place to put our money, is organic growth. Particularly when you look at the kind of ROEs we're running at. And if you look at our growth in premiums, you look at the growth potential, we think that will be the first and best place to maximize shareholder value. There's lots of other ways we use it, right. So share repurchases. I know a number of analysts brought that question up. Let me just go right to that. So we're no stranger to share repurchases. Since we went public, we bought back 83% of our shares outstanding for about $42 billion. Last 10 years, it was $20 billion in the last five years it was about $10 billion and a quarter of the shares outstanding. So we know how to and do share repurchases, when it makes sense. In this particular case, we think the growth opportunities outweigh the value of doing share repurchases. And that's because the returns are so high on that. Now if we don't, if you're keeping extra money around and you put it in the bond portfolio, and you're getting 5%, then obviously you should not be doing it. We do have other places we've used the money historically, and places we might use it in the future. So as we dialed down our equity allocation back when, we didn't think the risk and return was right. If we feel like that's appropriate, we'll dial that equity allocation up again. That uses capital. If we've also looked at acquiring growth. So the National General acquisition, Mario talked about it. And the reason we kept breaking it out so you could all see it, is that business just rocked it's twice its size. And the same thing is true with our protection plans business, which is nine or 10 times its size since we bought. And that was a little longer ago, it was seven years, but we paid $1 billion for it, and it's making over $120 million a year. So, we're feeling really good about that business, and its growth potential. So just know we always have our shareholders best interest in mind. We think about it broadly and we'll continue to do that.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please.\nGregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to, for my first question, focus on Slide 8, which is your retention slide. And in your comments you mentioned changing of agent compensation. If I'm not mistaken, some time ago you lowered agent compensation on renewals. And I'm wondering if that's having any spillover effect on retention. Obviously, the new shoe daps are doing strong, so your competitive position looks good. Also, as part of transformative growth, I think you've been streamlining some claims costs, some claims functions. Curious if you're seeing any impact of that on retention?\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Greg. This is Mario. Let me take your questions in order. First, on retention, when we isolate and look at, we look at retention a whole bunch of different ways. When we look at retention in the agency channel, it's actually up year-over-year. So what's happening and what you see on Page 8 is predominantly a function of price increases, which I think have the biggest impact on retention. Just from an agent compensation perspective as you mentioned, we kind of changed and have been transforming the model for them to really align with what both we want to do strategically, but also the value that customers see from agent. So we've incented agents to drive more new business, deepen relationships with customers and we see that with kind of all-time high levels of bundling. And agents, we're really pleased with the performance of our agency force and how productive they are and they're going to be a key part of our growth plan going forward. But that's really not the driver of retention that you see on the page. In terms of the claims organization, that's an area where even though the -- when you look at the ratio, it's pretty flat, that's a function of just having higher average premium. We're investing in claims. We actually have been adding staff so that we can continue to build on our claims capabilities, pay what we owe, drive a higher level of customer satisfaction. And again, we look at those as growth levers every bit as much as profit and severity management levers, but nothing really from a claim standpoint driving the retention numbers. And as I said, as a matter of fact, we're adding resources and dollars in claims to help both support the growth that we want to achieve going forward, but enhance customer satisfaction and effectively continue to manage severity levels.\nGregory Peters: Thanks for that additional information. I guess as my follow up question, just looking at the homeowners business, it looks like it's really performing well at a 62.1% underlying combined ratio. You're growing that business. I assume you're not growing just your standalone homeowners business with the policy force growth. It's part of a bundle. But maybe you can provide us some perspective on how you're able to grow that business considering all the rates you've thrown in that line of business?\nTom Wilson: I'll start and then Mario can jump in. So first, you're right and Mario called that we're just really good in homeowners. And we've made a lot of money at it. And because we've repositioned the business really over almost a 10-year period, everything from how do we underwrite to what's covered by the policy, to how we price, to our specificity and sophistication and pricing and the way we settle claims. So we're doing quite well there. You see, we are growing. Some of that is, as Mario talked about, our agents are really good at bundling and that leads to better lifetime value for us and cheaper prices for customers. So that's good on both sides. We do think that there's more growth potential there. Some of that is many people, because of the industry numbers that Mario quoted, have now decided not to grow in homeowners. And that gives us more opportunity, not just through the Allstate agents, but in particular through the independent agents. And I think we should be able to crack the code on direct. Nobody's really cracked the code on direct yet in selling homeowners, but I think there's great potential there. So I think there's growth in homeowners across all three channels. Obviously Allstate agents are doing well. The independent agent business, Mario might want to talk about what we're doing with custom 360. And then direct, I think we could be an industry leader. And my logic is, people buy houses off the web. Like if you buy a house off the web, you should buy your homeowners insurance off the web. So we'll have to sort that one out. So we're feeling good about it. I would just -- the other thing I would say is not really yet in market, but coming soon is ASC Affordable Simple Connected Homeowners. Mario has talked about Affordable Simple Connected Auto, which is in market in 25 states.\nMario Rizzo: Yes, 25 states now.\nTom Wilson: And ASC homeowners is even better. And it's got some really nice features to it, sophistication which will leave us behind in our classic product. And our classic product is far ahead of the industry. So we think it's another leap forward. You want to talk about like 360 or how you view homeowners, maybe by state or something?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. So Greg, again I just reiterate where Tom started. We're really good at homeowners and we think there is a real opportunity for us to grow homeowners in part right now because of the disruption that exists in the market. There's just fewer competitors out there that are wanting to write new business and we want to take advantage of that opportunity. We feel good about where our pricing is. As you mentioned, average premiums have gone up pretty consistently at a double digit clip over the last several years to keep pace with inflation. But when you look at our profit trends and you pointed out our underlying combined ratio which is currently in the low 60s, I think that's reflective of our ability to stay on top of loss trends and write new homeowners business at an attractive margin. We target low 90s which generates really strong returns on capital. We think we can do that and grow the business across all the distribution channels. And I'll just end with the opportunity with Custom360 in the independent agent channel because I think that becomes additive to our Allstate agents and our ability to grow direct in the Allstate brand. We're in I believe 24 states with Custom360. Currently, that's a standard and preferred auto offering along with homeowners that leverages Allstate's data and mid-market capabilities to price and really design that product. So it's intended to be the same product that we go to market with in the Allstate brand. As you can imagine, in the independent agent space we're getting really good traction on our ability to lead with homeowners which enables us to not just write the homeowners but also capture the auto opportunity from a packaged perspective. So we feel really good about the go forward opportunity in the independent agent space, which I think from a National General perspective becomes additive to the great success we've had in growing the nonstandard auto business and is really another way that we can leverage our homeowner capabilities broadly across all three horses, I'll use Tom's term, to really grow that business and generate really attractive returns going forward.\nTom Wilson: And Greg, let me make sure we fully answer your question. Price sensitivity, you referenced the rate of increase and it is high, it's higher than auto insurance right at this point. Not necessarily over the last three years, but pretty high. But that's -- it's just less price sensitive than auto insurance is. There are a whole bunch of reasons. Some of the people like their house a lot. Second, people know their house is actually worth more and so when we're charging more, they know their house is worth more.\nMario Rizzo: Not so much on cars. So, we had to raise auto insurance prices because the houses or the cars became worth. But people didn't really think about it that way. They do think about their home value. So we're comfortable with where we're at.\nGregory Peters: Thanks for the additional information.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. I actually have two on renewal ratios. First, maybe conceptually just looking at the slide eight, as the company grows in nonstandard auto and in direct, two areas where I think, and then correct me if I'm wrong, renewal rates for the industry have tended to be a bit lower. Is it fair to think of a run rate renewal rate that would be a bit lower than the call it through cycle 87.5 or so that I see in the slide?\nTom Wilson: Insightful question, Mara, you want to take that?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. The first just to be clear, the numbers you see on the page are Allstate brand. So there's just not that much nonstandard auto. There's more direct, but at least currently, again, not a meaningful impact in the trends. On a go forward basis, I guess, I'd broaden the statement a little bit, Yaron and say, the more new business we write, that first renewal period or the first policy period tends to be lower than the book overall. So the more new business volume we write, there will be some downward pressure on the overall retention rate. Current volumes aren't meaningful enough to really drive a significant impact. But you're right from that perspective. And then certainly in the non-standard auto space, we've seen it with National General as we broaden the risk appetite in the Allstate brand and kind of do the opposite of what we're doing in homeowners, take advantage and leverage National General's non-standard auto capabilities in the Allstate brand that will have an impact on retention. Again, magnitude, we'll have to call that out for you when we see it. But certainly that business tends to retain at lower levels because those customers just tend to shop more. So those things will have an impact on retention going forward. But I would say what you see in Page 8, pretty much a muted impact on those items at this point.\nYaron Kinar: Great. And then just think about the renewal ratio from here on. I think at times you see a little bit of a breakdown of that inverse correlation between rate increases and the renewal ratio. And we saw a little bit of that a bit earlier in this current cycle. Obviously we're seeing that pick up now. But I guess bottom line, is there a bit of a lag currently between the rate increases and the renewal ratio? One that we -- I don't think we was as pronounced in prior years?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Yaron, it's Mario, again. There is almost certainly a lag when you think about implementing a rate increase in auto. It takes six months for that to be implemented across the entirety of the book and then you'll earn it over the six months after that. So there is a lag in terms of the rate we've taken or the industry takes and the impact on retention. And you see that in our numbers. One of the things though that I point out is and we've been clear on this. We believe we will need to take less rate given where profitability is. But again, this is a state-by-state, market-by-market business. So when we need to take prices up to keep pace with loss trends, we're going to do that. And what you saw in the third quarter, about 70% of the rate that we took was in three states. It was in New York, New Jersey, and an increase we implemented in Texas. So we're going to continue to take rate where we need to. We just think there's going to be less of it. And again, we'll look to manage retention alongside that.\nYaron Kinar: But I guess what I'm trying to get at here is I think the big rate increases that we saw in the beginning of the year were really first quarter weighted. California, New York, New Jersey. I would have thought that the full impact of those rates taking effect in the first quarter would have been in the second quarter. And by the time we came out of the third quarter, call it August, September, we'd see a little less of that pressure?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, the California rate was in the first quarter. New York and New Jersey were actually implemented in the third quarter. So -- and I believe it was over 18% in New York and 13.7 or 13.4 in New Jersey. So again, there's some pretty meaningful rates that we've implemented currently, again, to get those markets back to where they need to be from a margin perspective so we can open up to right new business.\nTom Wilson: So, Yaron, I would just say that the leg is muted and it kind of goes up and goes down, right? Like, not everybody shops, the minute they get the price, it's late, they get the bill, they just pay the bill. Then they decide after a couple of months, geez, I should really think about this. So it's not a simple on renewal that happens.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nBob Huang: Good morning. My question also kind of follows around that line of business. So if we think about your combined ratio and growth, right. In auto, you typically target a mid-90 combined ratio, understanding that pricing has a lagging effect and then retention and growth also does. But if we just look at the combined ratio, is the current level good enough for you to really step on the gas for growth? Or do you feel you probably need a one or two point more on the auto combined ratio side before you're fully comfortable with fully ramping up that growth going forward?\nTom Wilson: We think that the auto profit improvement plan has been successfully completed. That's why we dialed up advertising by 60% from 2021. That's not just up, that's way up over last year. It's like we're not even in the same zip code. So yes, we spend the money and are investing the money because we think it will -- there are good returns. And there's like things happen in every state. So, Bob, sometimes you got a state, sometimes you back off. Mario's team is constantly doing that. But when you just look in total, we're feeling good about it in total. If you look at a couple of states, yeah, there's still some work to do.\nBob Huang: Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you for that. Second question is around the homeowner side. Understand that you kind of said there are a few competitors now. The technology really makes it easier potentially for homeowner insurance to really grow from here. But isn't it fair to say that the states where there are opportunities, there are also states where people are trying to pull out. So growth, wouldn't that be geography related? Can you maybe talk about what regions do you think is more attractive on the homeowner front or where do you think the opportunity lies in the growth on that space?\nTom Wilson: So let me go up a minute and then turn it over to Mario. First, we think homeowners is a good business. There is the challenge of increased severe weather and what it does to increase catastrophe losses, which you referenced. Like why go right where there's a bunch of catastrophes? I mean if you can get the right price, its fine. And then you just buy reinsurance for a risk you don't want. And when you look at increased losses from weather related events, there are three drivers. One just more storms and more severe -- mostly more severe storms actually. Two is houses are worth more and three people are building houses in places that are risk. To your other point, those latter two you can know, like those are known knowns. You can factor those into your pricing effect. You can factor those into your growth opportunities. You can factor that into where you try to get new customers. It's the third one. But the third one tends to be the -- is the smallest according to a couple of external studies of the dry attribution on increased catastrophe losses. So the unknown known of what will happen to the severity of storms is the smallest driver of the increase in catastrophe losses. So we feel good about it in total from a macro standpoint. And then we execute it obviously at a not even at a much below a state level. You get east of Sunrise Highway, we get different standards and if you're west of Sunrise Highway on Long Island. So Mario, do you want to talk about where you see growth opportunities?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. Maybe I'll start with where we don't, because I think it gets to the first part of your question. And two states in particular, Florida and California obviously really challenged homeowner markets that there's been a lot of pullback across the industry. Those are not states that we're looking to get bigger in. So certainly those would not be where we focus our growth efforts and then we'll continue to manage PML and coastal exposure to be within our risk appetite. But then once you kind of get away from that, really the rest of the country, particularly the middle part of the country is -- there's real opportunity for us to continue to grow homeowners. And that's not where you get the hurricanes or necessarily the wildfires. It's more severe weather, tornadoes, hail and so on. And what we found is a lot of competitors have pulled back in those states given severe weather experience. I think that's where our capabilities from a product, a pricing, a risk management perspective really enable us to take advantage of the disruption in the market and grow pretty broadly geographically and not have to kind of grow where, I guess where we can, because nobody else wants it, but actually grow where we think we can generate attractive returns. And that geographically is the vast majority of the country. And again, that's why I think being good at homeowners and having an effective system and operating model to write it and write it profitably is a real competitive advantage for us. And I think you see that in the growth trends really over the course of this year.\nTom Wilson: And I just said, we grew 2.5% from the last year, and we did grow in two giant markets that Mario talked about, which I'm going to guess are 15% to 20% of the homes in the United States. So, we did quite well there.\nBob Huang: Excellent. Really appreciate the answer. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of [Christian Gitzoff] from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning, Mario. You said a 75% to 80% of your auto premiums are currently open for new business. So is it safe to assume that auto policies grew quarter-over-quarter in those states in the Q3?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. I won't go into any state specific detail, but what I will say is we're open broadly. The 26% increase in new business that you saw was not concentrated in a handful of states. It was pretty broad as well, but so -- were the retention decline. So really it's a combination of all those things kind of working together. There's markets that grew in total. There's others that did not. But we're focused on having all of them turn positive at some point.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. And then so with the auto retention being down a point sequentially, and then PIFs were down 50bps, this is auto. Like, is the majority of the declines in those metrics driven by California, New York, New Jersey, just given, like the big rate increases we saw, that were implement, I guess approved in December. They were kind of implemented throughout the year. And then when would you kind of expect in, I guess excluding those three states, right? That PIF improved quarter-over-quarter. Trying to get a sense of how big of a drag those three states have?\nTom Wilson: Yes. The quarter-over-quarter change in retention, I know came up across a number of reports that came out. Let me just comment on that because there's really two things going on. Some of the decline, probably about 40% of the decline is attributable to a handful of states. It's California as well as New York and New Jersey that are having a meaningful impact quarter-over-quarter. And again that's driven by some of the larger rate increases that we've implemented this year. There's another portion of it that I think reinforces why we made the disclosure change. We did, which is about 60% of that sequential decline in retention is attributed to -- we're migrating some legacy encompass books of business in some reasonably large states to National General. One of those states is California. And what that does is it drags down the Allstate brand renewal ratio. But as those policies -- as those customers opt to take a National General policy, it shows up in National General's numbers. So that's where looking at it by brand is -- I'm sorry, it was insurance. I misspoke. I said encompass, their legacy assurance customers. But that's why looking at it by brand, you just see -- as we operate the business in total with multiple brands, some of those brand metrics get distorted. So we just think it's more constructive to look at the total.\nMario Rizzo: And I think look at the long term number. We're down 2.7 points. We think it should be able to go up from there. So quarter-to-quarter we'll do full attribution on it. We're happy to talk about it. But it's the real drivers who just raise prices a lot, so a lot of people wouldn't shop.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just comment on your expectations for the timing of the retention ratio improvements. I know that you mentioned leveling off of rate increases should help retention. So I'm wondering, are you seeing any evidence of that here in October or is it still too early to tell?\nTom Wilson: First, obviously sooner is better than later. So we're all on it. The whole team's on it. There's a whole bunch of stuff we're doing that Mario mentioned to make it move and you can see benefits in individual states. So we have some pretty large states that it's actually up. So we have confidence that we know how to manage our way through this. But we haven't really done a projection on that. We're comfortable giving to everybody to say here's the number you should count on. What we do know is as Mario pointed out is we expect to grow market share and personal profit liability and that's by doing transformative growth. In the near term we have to get retention up and continue to expand our new business. But then longer term all the work we're doing there is just even more sustainable. So rolling out ASC auto, ASC homeowners, all that work will drive long term growth.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it, thanks. It definitely feels like you guys are pretty confident around just the -- or feel optimistic that the tempering rate increases should help improve that retention. I mean from your standpoint is it really just -- we're sort of just having this timing impact from these three big states that need to just sort of work their way through, and like we're on the cusp here of a turn, or I mean I'm just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about it internally?\nTom Wilson: We're thinking about we need to do a better job for our customers. So, we're charging them a lot more, they expect more, they deserve more. Some of that's because their cars and stuff and Bob the injury claims are higher, but like we need to do a good job for them. So it's not just oh let's wait this out and not take a bunch of price increases and it'll bounce back. We're actively working on this year alone we have a goal on double-digit millions of improving the customer experience individual transactions. We'll have another goal for next year that will be similar, but different. We're working on how do, we get more precise on the price. So if you're an elderly person, you don't drive much, you should have Milewise you'll cut your price in half. So we're not, we're not, it's not like we just think oh we're through this. I think this is just provide our - we use our operational excellence and capabilities, to go back in now and fine tune the fact that we had to raise prices a lot, so we can keep more customers.\nDavid Motemaden: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, thank you for getting me at the end. Two questions, one whimsical and one numbers. You talked about sort of cracking the code, on how to get people to buy homeowners insurance online. How far away are we from being able to call Allstate and getting into an AI conversation with Dennis Haysbert or Dean Winters that knowledgeable about what you can do to save money, by switching to Allstate and what you can do for your policy?\nTom Wilson: I love whimsical questions, but I would say that one's probably not whimsical really. We have a - I'd say let's call sales sidekick, which will help people do a better job of interacting with customers. It's going to dramatically change the way that the people interact with other people, which is why Mario was talking about how we have to reposition the off-site agents. It gives us an opportunity to do that at lower cost. So work they had to do before where they couldn't do, or they had lower close rates, because they didn't know some stuff will increase their productivity, and make them even better. So, we're feeling really good about where that might go. And I think, if you look at our web stuff on ASC, that's quite sophisticated too. So Mario, what would you add?\nMario Rizzo: Yes, the only other thing I'd add, Josh, that makes it not as whimsical as you might think, is we have a lot of data on homeowners, both in terms of customers we've insured in the past and just on the homes across the country in general, which I think facilitates our ability to do what you described, and be really efficient - intelligently being able to price and manage the homeowner risk. So that's the other component I think that gets us and creates the ability to do what you, what you suggested\nJosh Shanker: And then numbers look, ad spend is way up as you look to grow the business. I'm multiplying your number on that buy premium and seeing it up substantially. You also gave us a lot of data around new issued applications, and we can make some guesses around gross new customers. The ad spend is up significantly more than the new customer acquisition. Can you talk a little about what is sensible acquisition cost per customer, how we should think about it. And clearly are you getting the kind of pack on new business that you can make a return over a two or three year period on that investment?\nTom Wilson: A bunch of questions in this, and let me end on this one first. Advertising is a little bit like driving a car when you first, when you hit the gas pedal it doesn't take off right away. It takes a while to get to 60. So you've seen us do that. We like the performance we see in terms of brand consideration. We like the number of quotes that have gone up, and we like our close rate. So but if you said, did we get back every dollar we spent economically as we're ramping it up? No you, you're kind of investing some for the future. That said, we have highly sophisticated metrics around it and it's both upper and lower funnel. If you break it into upper funnel being, kind of brand image stuff, lower funnel being, I send you, I got a specific lead and I buy that lead and I know you're shopping. So we have highly sophisticated math around that. It continues to be a sophistication game. We think we're pretty good at it. Outside people tell us we're pretty good at it. That said, you can always be better. And when you're spending billions of dollars, you ought to be really good at it. So, we're feeling good about the investment to-date. We think we can continue to spend more, and that will drive economic growth. But if it doesn't, we have the ability to just dial it down whenever we want. It's not really that complicated. So thank you all for this. Our goal, of course, is to increase personal profit, liability and market share, which we talked a lot about today. Also broaden our Protection offerings, well capitalized, we have good shareholder returns, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Jess Merten",
            "content": "Thank you, Mario. Let's shift to Slide 10 to review investment performance. A proactive approach to portfolio management that optimizes return per unit of risk across the enterprise generated strong returns this quarter. Our disciplined approach includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, interest rates and credit spreads. The chart on the left shows the fixed income, portfolio yield and assets under management trend over the last several years. Fixed income yield shown with the orange line has steadily increased as we repositioned into higher yielding longer duration assets. Based on interest rates in the third quarter our fixed income yield is now generally in line with market yields. In the gray bars you can see growth in the portfolio book value. Since the fourth quarter of 2021, book value has increased by 14% or $9.1 billion, reflecting the impact of higher underwriting cash flows attributable to increased premiums and reserve levels as well as portfolio cash flows that increased because of higher coupon rates. Growth in assets and higher yields benefited net investment income as shown in the chart on the right. Net Investment income totaled $783 million in the quarter, which is $94 million above the third quarter of last year. Market based income of $708 million, which is shown in blue, was $141 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact of a fixed income yield that is 60 basis points above the third quarter last year. Performance based income of $143 million shown in black was $43 million below the prior year quarter, reflecting lower real estate investment results. While this quarter's result is lower than our long term expectation, our returns continue to be strong and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected. Slide 11 highlights strong results in the protection plans business, which is one of the five companies in the protection services segment that also includes Arity, Roadside, dealer Services and identity protection. The Protection Plans business provides warranties for consumer electronics, computers and tablets, TVs, mobile phones, major appliances and furniture through strong domestic and international retail distribution relationships. Revenues for this business totaled $512 million in the third quarter and increased 23.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting growth in international markets. Profitable growth resulted in adjusted net income of $39 million, a $19 million increase compared to the prior year quarter, as strong operational execution increased margins and enabled successful implementation of the strategy to expand distribution relationships and product offerings. We continue to invest in this fast growing business. In October, Allstate Protection Plans acquired Kingfisher to enhance capabilities in mobile phone protection. Now let's Transition to Slide 12 to focus on the terms and accounting treatment of the sale of the Employer Voluntary Benefits business. As we announced in August, Allstate finalized an agreement to sell the Employer Voluntary Benefits business, which I will also refer to as the EVB business for a purchase price of $2 billion to StanCorp Financial. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approvals. As a reminder, the EVB sale is the first step in a strategic decision to pursue divestiture of the Employer Voluntary Benefits, group health and individual health businesses to capture value through greater strategic alignment. The EVB transaction is economically and financially attractive for shareholders. Allstate retains the economics of the business until closing and results continue to be reflected in net income and adjusted net income. In the quarter $3.2 billion of assets and $2.2 billion of liabilities related to the EVB business have been classified as held for sale. As you can see on the right of the slide, we're estimating a $600 million gain and had previously disclosed that we expect the transaction to generate approximately $1.6 billion of capital. Moving to health and benefits results for the quarter, Premium and contract charges for the segment increased 5.2% for $24 million compared to the prior year quarter. The individual and group health businesses saw strong growth with premiums and contract charges up by 8.1% and 20.2% respectively. This growth was partially offset by a modest decrease in the EVB business. Adjusted net income for the segment of $37 million in the quarter was $32 million lower than the prior year quarter as increased benefit utilization across all three businesses impacted profitability, underwriting and rate actions are being taken to quickly address the benefit ratio trends and restore margins to historical levels. The process to evaluate disposition of the group and individual businesses is progressing. Let's wrap up with Slide 13 to recap Allstate's strategy and path to value creation. Operational excellence ensures that we react to changing business conditions and maintain margins at target levels. Transformative growth investments are being made to create sustainable growth and Allstate delivers attractive returns. With that as context, let's open the line for questions."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Good morning. We appreciate you investing your time in understanding the value creation potential at Allstate. I'm going to provide an overview of results. Mario and Jess will walk through the operating performance, and then we'll address your questions. So let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy has two components, increased personal Property-Liability market share, and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. We now have more than 200 million policies in force. On the right hand side, you can see Allstate's performance for the third quarter. Total revenues of $16.6 billion were up 14.7%, compared to the prior year quarter. Allstate generated net income of $1.2 billion and adjusted net income of $3.91 per share. Return on equity was 26.1% over the last 12 months. The Property-Liability business, is now positioned for growth. Execution of the auto profit improvement plan has restored auto margins, near term auto insurance policy growth will require us to improve customer retention and increase new business levels, both of which Mario will discuss. The homeowners business had good returns and is growing. The transformative growth initiatives, to build a low cost digital insurer with affordable, simple and connected protection, will ensure that this growth is sustainable. Proactive investing also benefited income as the decision to lengthen duration at the right time increased portfolio yields. In addition, higher insurance prices, and increased reserve levels create a much larger investment portfolio, which also raises income. Protection plans continues to profitably grow, and we recently did a small acquisition to expand mobile device protection capabilities. Let's move to Slide 3. Here you can see the operational execution generated excellent financial results. Revenues increased to $16.6 billion. As you can see in the upper left, Property-Liability earned premiums were up 11.6%. Net investment income for the quarter was $783 million that's 13.6% higher than the prior year quarter. Net income was $1.16 billion. Adjusted net income as I mentioned was $3.91 per share. And then, you can see in the lower right that the return on equity was 26.1%. This shows that Allstate's operational excellence enabled us to dramatically improve results from last year. Now let's hear from Mario on Property-Liability results. Jimmy, let me make a couple of comments and Mario can jump in. First, we don't give growth projections, so we're not going to comment on that. We gave you. We put the numbers in there, so you can do your own analysis of how you think we'll do in retention, and how you think we'll do in new business. We obviously believe we can grow market share, which is what our whole strategy is about. When you look at the competitive environment, you continue to see progressive advertising aggressively GEICO has gotten back into the market, but perhaps not as aggressively as they have in the past. And State Farm continues to try to grow, but as you know, they have an underwriting profitability challenge that they're I suspect they will take out, but we'll only see. But I would also not just focus on those big players, but there's a whole bunch of other players that are more moderate size or smaller that either don't have the firepower in advertising to compete, or don't have the pricing sophistication. Mario, do you want to make comments about how you're feeling about growth? Jimmy, let me add just a couple of things. On a longer term perspective, what Mario talked about. So when auto profitability went negative, we said first priority, get the rate, don't be too specific about it. And what Mario is talking about is going back in now and saying, okay, well we got the total rate. How many more people should be using Milewise? How many more people should be using telematics? Those are great opportunities for us to leverage our innovation and keep more customers. So there's a bunch of good work going on there. So the priority that we gave to the team was we need to make money in auto insurance. We've done that. Now we're ready to go back in and, which should drive retention. The other thing I would say is on distribution. If you look at our historical growth, this is the first time really we have three fully functioning channels. Like, we've got three horses here, all ready to run. You can see the growth. And direct is up a lot this versus last year. But that's, because direct was the first place we shutdown, too. When it came to how do we get profitability up in auto insurance, we said well, first, if we're losing money on it, we shouldn't write it. Rather than take that hit in volume to the Allstate aging channel, which needs to be maintained in terms of its revenue and growth, we said, let's just do it to direct. So the direct bounce back, is just where we are now. But in that pause, we really built out our capability. So, we're feeling good about having three horses to drive growth. A very appropriate question. I'll channel Jess for a minute here, and just say, we've always had a lot of capital. So I know not everybody believed that, but we've always been financially very strong. But as we think about capital, it is something we take very seriously. It's really one of the key things we do for shareholders, and we feel like we've been good stewards of that. As you look forward, we think the best and first place to put our money, is organic growth. Particularly when you look at the kind of ROEs we're running at. And if you look at our growth in premiums, you look at the growth potential, we think that will be the first and best place to maximize shareholder value. There's lots of other ways we use it, right. So share repurchases. I know a number of analysts brought that question up. Let me just go right to that. So we're no stranger to share repurchases. Since we went public, we bought back 83% of our shares outstanding for about $42 billion. Last 10 years, it was $20 billion in the last five years it was about $10 billion and a quarter of the shares outstanding. So we know how to and do share repurchases, when it makes sense. In this particular case, we think the growth opportunities outweigh the value of doing share repurchases. And that's because the returns are so high on that. Now if we don't, if you're keeping extra money around and you put it in the bond portfolio, and you're getting 5%, then obviously you should not be doing it. We do have other places we've used the money historically, and places we might use it in the future. So as we dialed down our equity allocation back when, we didn't think the risk and return was right. If we feel like that's appropriate, we'll dial that equity allocation up again. That uses capital. If we've also looked at acquiring growth. So the National General acquisition, Mario talked about it. And the reason we kept breaking it out so you could all see it, is that business just rocked it's twice its size. And the same thing is true with our protection plans business, which is nine or 10 times its size since we bought. And that was a little longer ago, it was seven years, but we paid $1 billion for it, and it's making over $120 million a year. So, we're feeling really good about that business, and its growth potential. So just know we always have our shareholders best interest in mind. We think about it broadly and we'll continue to do that. I'll start and then Mario can jump in. So first, you're right and Mario called that we're just really good in homeowners. And we've made a lot of money at it. And because we've repositioned the business really over almost a 10-year period, everything from how do we underwrite to what's covered by the policy, to how we price, to our specificity and sophistication and pricing and the way we settle claims. So we're doing quite well there. You see, we are growing. Some of that is, as Mario talked about, our agents are really good at bundling and that leads to better lifetime value for us and cheaper prices for customers. So that's good on both sides. We do think that there's more growth potential there. Some of that is many people, because of the industry numbers that Mario quoted, have now decided not to grow in homeowners. And that gives us more opportunity, not just through the Allstate agents, but in particular through the independent agents. And I think we should be able to crack the code on direct. Nobody's really cracked the code on direct yet in selling homeowners, but I think there's great potential there. So I think there's growth in homeowners across all three channels. Obviously Allstate agents are doing well. The independent agent business, Mario might want to talk about what we're doing with custom 360. And then direct, I think we could be an industry leader. And my logic is, people buy houses off the web. Like if you buy a house off the web, you should buy your homeowners insurance off the web. So we'll have to sort that one out. So we're feeling good about it. I would just -- the other thing I would say is not really yet in market, but coming soon is ASC Affordable Simple Connected Homeowners. Mario has talked about Affordable Simple Connected Auto, which is in market in 25 states. And ASC homeowners is even better. And it's got some really nice features to it, sophistication which will leave us behind in our classic product. And our classic product is far ahead of the industry. So we think it's another leap forward. You want to talk about like 360 or how you view homeowners, maybe by state or something? And Greg, let me make sure we fully answer your question. Price sensitivity, you referenced the rate of increase and it is high, it's higher than auto insurance right at this point. Not necessarily over the last three years, but pretty high. But that's -- it's just less price sensitive than auto insurance is. There are a whole bunch of reasons. Some of the people like their house a lot. Second, people know their house is actually worth more and so when we're charging more, they know their house is worth more. Insightful question, Mara, you want to take that? So, Yaron, I would just say that the leg is muted and it kind of goes up and goes down, right? Like, not everybody shops, the minute they get the price, it's late, they get the bill, they just pay the bill. Then they decide after a couple of months, geez, I should really think about this. So it's not a simple on renewal that happens. We think that the auto profit improvement plan has been successfully completed. That's why we dialed up advertising by 60% from 2021. That's not just up, that's way up over last year. It's like we're not even in the same zip code. So yes, we spend the money and are investing the money because we think it will -- there are good returns. And there's like things happen in every state. So, Bob, sometimes you got a state, sometimes you back off. Mario's team is constantly doing that. But when you just look in total, we're feeling good about it in total. If you look at a couple of states, yeah, there's still some work to do. So let me go up a minute and then turn it over to Mario. First, we think homeowners is a good business. There is the challenge of increased severe weather and what it does to increase catastrophe losses, which you referenced. Like why go right where there's a bunch of catastrophes? I mean if you can get the right price, its fine. And then you just buy reinsurance for a risk you don't want. And when you look at increased losses from weather related events, there are three drivers. One just more storms and more severe -- mostly more severe storms actually. Two is houses are worth more and three people are building houses in places that are risk. To your other point, those latter two you can know, like those are known knowns. You can factor those into your pricing effect. You can factor those into your growth opportunities. You can factor that into where you try to get new customers. It's the third one. But the third one tends to be the -- is the smallest according to a couple of external studies of the dry attribution on increased catastrophe losses. So the unknown known of what will happen to the severity of storms is the smallest driver of the increase in catastrophe losses. So we feel good about it in total from a macro standpoint. And then we execute it obviously at a not even at a much below a state level. You get east of Sunrise Highway, we get different standards and if you're west of Sunrise Highway on Long Island. So Mario, do you want to talk about where you see growth opportunities? And I just said, we grew 2.5% from the last year, and we did grow in two giant markets that Mario talked about, which I'm going to guess are 15% to 20% of the homes in the United States. So, we did quite well there. Yes. The quarter-over-quarter change in retention, I know came up across a number of reports that came out. Let me just comment on that because there's really two things going on. Some of the decline, probably about 40% of the decline is attributable to a handful of states. It's California as well as New York and New Jersey that are having a meaningful impact quarter-over-quarter. And again that's driven by some of the larger rate increases that we've implemented this year. There's another portion of it that I think reinforces why we made the disclosure change. We did, which is about 60% of that sequential decline in retention is attributed to -- we're migrating some legacy encompass books of business in some reasonably large states to National General. One of those states is California. And what that does is it drags down the Allstate brand renewal ratio. But as those policies -- as those customers opt to take a National General policy, it shows up in National General's numbers. So that's where looking at it by brand is -- I'm sorry, it was insurance. I misspoke. I said encompass, their legacy assurance customers. But that's why looking at it by brand, you just see -- as we operate the business in total with multiple brands, some of those brand metrics get distorted. So we just think it's more constructive to look at the total. First, obviously sooner is better than later. So we're all on it. The whole team's on it. There's a whole bunch of stuff we're doing that Mario mentioned to make it move and you can see benefits in individual states. So we have some pretty large states that it's actually up. So we have confidence that we know how to manage our way through this. But we haven't really done a projection on that. We're comfortable giving to everybody to say here's the number you should count on. What we do know is as Mario pointed out is we expect to grow market share and personal profit liability and that's by doing transformative growth. In the near term we have to get retention up and continue to expand our new business. But then longer term all the work we're doing there is just even more sustainable. So rolling out ASC auto, ASC homeowners, all that work will drive long term growth. We're thinking about we need to do a better job for our customers. So, we're charging them a lot more, they expect more, they deserve more. Some of that's because their cars and stuff and Bob the injury claims are higher, but like we need to do a good job for them. So it's not just oh let's wait this out and not take a bunch of price increases and it'll bounce back. We're actively working on this year alone we have a goal on double-digit millions of improving the customer experience individual transactions. We'll have another goal for next year that will be similar, but different. We're working on how do, we get more precise on the price. So if you're an elderly person, you don't drive much, you should have Milewise you'll cut your price in half. So we're not, we're not, it's not like we just think oh we're through this. I think this is just provide our - we use our operational excellence and capabilities, to go back in now and fine tune the fact that we had to raise prices a lot, so we can keep more customers. I love whimsical questions, but I would say that one's probably not whimsical really. We have a - I'd say let's call sales sidekick, which will help people do a better job of interacting with customers. It's going to dramatically change the way that the people interact with other people, which is why Mario was talking about how we have to reposition the off-site agents. It gives us an opportunity to do that at lower cost. So work they had to do before where they couldn't do, or they had lower close rates, because they didn't know some stuff will increase their productivity, and make them even better. So, we're feeling really good about where that might go. And I think, if you look at our web stuff on ASC, that's quite sophisticated too. So Mario, what would you add? A bunch of questions in this, and let me end on this one first. Advertising is a little bit like driving a car when you first, when you hit the gas pedal it doesn't take off right away. It takes a while to get to 60. So you've seen us do that. We like the performance we see in terms of brand consideration. We like the number of quotes that have gone up, and we like our close rate. So but if you said, did we get back every dollar we spent economically as we're ramping it up? No you, you're kind of investing some for the future. That said, we have highly sophisticated metrics around it and it's both upper and lower funnel. If you break it into upper funnel being, kind of brand image stuff, lower funnel being, I send you, I got a specific lead and I buy that lead and I know you're shopping. So we have highly sophisticated math around that. It continues to be a sophistication game. We think we're pretty good at it. Outside people tell us we're pretty good at it. That said, you can always be better. And when you're spending billions of dollars, you ought to be really good at it. So, we're feeling good about the investment to-date. We think we can continue to spend more, and that will drive economic growth. But if it doesn't, we have the ability to just dial it down whenever we want. It's not really that complicated. So thank you all for this. Our goal, of course, is to increase personal profit, liability and market share, which we talked a lot about today. Also broaden our Protection offerings, well capitalized, we have good shareholder returns, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Before I go into my remarks on the quarter, I want to call out a change we made to our disclosures. You'll notice that we simplified our Protection segment disclosures this quarter, to focus on product and channel instead of brand. For the past several years, we've provided detail on both the Allstate and National General brands separately, to create transparency into National General's performance and allow you to evaluate the acquisition. National General has been a highly successful acquisition, since it is now twice its size, generates excellent returns and gives us strong competitive positions in both independent agent distribution and non-standard auto risk. We're now building on this success by combining operations, such as expanding the sale of non-standard business under the Allstate brand. As a result, performance should be evaluated for the protection business in total, and by distribution channel versus by brand and that's why we made the change. So in keeping with this approach, my commentary today will be focused on performance on total auto and homeowner lines, and production by distribution channel. With that as background, let's start on Slide 4. On the top of the table on the left, you can see Property-Liability premiums of $13.7 billion, increased 11.6% in the third quarter driven by higher average premiums. Underwriting income of $495 million improved by $909 million, compared to the prior year quarter, as improved underlying margins more than offset higher catastrophes. The expense ratio of 21.5 was 0.3 points higher than prior year, due to increased advertising. As we continue to accelerate growth investments in rate adequate states and risk segments. The chart on the right depicts the components of the 96.4 combined ratio. The loss ratio shown in light blue includes losses of $1.7 billion and was 2.8 points higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 83.2 in dark blue improved by 8.7 points, compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by higher average earned premium, and improved loss cost strengths. Prior year reserve reestimates excluding catastrophes had only a minor impact on current quarter results, as favorable development in personal auto and homeowners insurance, was more than offset by increases in personal umbrella and runoff business, primarily related to asbestos related claims, which was recorded this quarter, as a result of our annual third quarter discontinued lines reserve review. Now let's dive deeper into auto insurance margins on Slide 5, where you can see the success of the auto profit improvement plan. The third quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 94.8 improved by 7.3 points, compared to the prior year quarter as average earned premiums outpaced loss costs. Average underlying loss in expense was 4.8% above prior year quarter, reflecting higher current year incurred severity estimates, primarily driven by bodily injury coverage offset by lower accident frequency, as well as higher advertising investments to drive new business growth. Physical damage severity increases continue to moderate, while bodily injury severity continues to trend above broader inflation indices. Our claims team continues to focus on operational actions, to mitigate the impact of inflationary trends. As a reminder, we regularly review claim severity expectations throughout the year. If the expected severity for the current year changes, we record the year-to-date impact in the current quarter, even though a portion of that impact is attributable to previous quarters. For 2022 and 2023, the bars in the graph reflect the updated average severity estimates, as of the end of each of those years to remove the volatility, related to intra-year severity adjustments. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2024, the full year claim severity estimate went down, so there was a benefit from prior quarters included in the third quarter's reported results. This benefit was worth 0.8 points in the third quarter, with the adjusted quarterly combined ratio of 95.6 as shown on the far right bar. Now let's review homeowners insurance on Slide 6, which generates attractive returns and growth opportunities. Allstate is an industry leader in homeowners insurance, generating a low 90s combined ratio over the last 10 years. As you can see in the chart on the left, this performance compares favorably to the industry, which experienced an underwriting loss and a combined ratio of 103 over the same time period. Moving to the table on the right, Allstate Protection homeowners written premium increased by 10.8%, compared to prior year reflecting higher average gross written premium per policy, and policy enforced growth of 2.5%. The third quarter combined ratio of 98.2 resulted in $60 million of underwriting income, compared to a $131 million loss in the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 62.1 improved by 10.8 points, due to higher average premium and lower non-catastrophe loss costs. For the first nine months of 2024, homeowners insurance generated an underwriting profit of $249 million, despite $1.2 billion of catastrophe losses in in the third quarter. Let me provide insight into the growth potential of the Property-Liability business starting on Slide 7. In the chart on the left, you see the composition of the Property-Liability book. Homeowners in medium blue represents approximately 20% of policies in force. Homeowners' insurance policies in force increased by 2.5% as retention has improved by close to half a point, compared to last year and new issued applications are close to 20% above prior year. As you can see in the right hand column. We view homeowners as a growth opportunity. Auto policies in the dark blue account for approximately two-thirds of Property-Liability policies enforced. As you can see on the right side of the page, overall policies enforce declined by 1.5%. This reflects a decline in customer retention to 84.7%, which is 2/10th of a point below the prior year quarter, but much lower than historical levels. We did have a 26% increase in new issued applications, which offset some of the retention losses. Now let's go through each of these components to give you insight into how to assess growth prospects. Let's start with customer retention on Slide 8. This chart shows Allstate brand auto insurance retention over a 10-year period which is primarily standard auto insurance risks. There is a couple of key points I want to make on this slide. First, raising prices leads to lower retentions as customers shop for other options. Second, the large increases in the last several years have led to a significant decline in retention since 2022, which has negatively impacted policies in force. This has, however, recently leveled off as price increases have moderated. Let's look at the three periods with the arrows. In 2015 and 2016, we raised auto insurance prices, which you can see from the dotted line because of an increase in the frequency of accidents. The graph shows how this led to lag declines in retention from 88.2 in 2014 to 86.7 in 2017. Over the next three years, price increases were relatively modest and retention recovered reaching 88.3 by 2019. Now, there are lots of factors impacting retention, such as the amount of new business you write, the risk type of that business, number of bundled policies and specific actions taken in big states like California and Florida, as well as customer satisfaction levels. But the biggest driver is price. Increased advertising and price competition had a modest negative impact over the next several years with retention hovering around 87%. You can see this in the most recent period where retention has declined by 2.7 points over the last 10 quarters, which reflected rate increases of 36% on a cumulative basis. Looking forward, we expect lower rate increases given the profitability of auto insurance. This year, for example, Allstate brand rates have been increased by 6.3% compared to 9.5% in the first nine months of last year. Lower price increases should translate into higher retention. To help you model this out, every point of retention is worth approximately 350,000 policies enforced each and every year, or 1.4% of the current policy count. Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss the success we've had in increasing new business levels this year. We continue to invest in transformative growth while we executed the profit improvement plan. These foundational investments enable us to go to market with a multichannel distribution strategy that serves customers based on their personal preferences and has resulted in a 26% increase in new business in the third quarter shown in the far right column at the bottom. While profit actions previously restricted our new business appetite, rate adequacy has now been achieved in the vast majority of states. Third quarter advertising spend was roughly 60% higher than the same quarter in 2021. In the Allstate agency channel, the compensation structure was also changed to improve growth and agent productivity at lower distribution costs. Allstate Agency new business was up 16% over the prior year quarter with bundling rates at point of sale at all-time highs. The national general acquisition enabled us to grow independent agency new business by 14% over the prior year quarter. In the direct channel, we are back to 2022 levels with fewer underwriting restrictions, increased advertising and the new affordable, simple and connected auto product which is currently available in 25 states. New business is 56% over prior year and we expect to increase to continue increasing volume in this channel which now represents 31% of total auto new business. This level of new business will drive future growth. Every 5% increase in new issued applications above the current run rate increases policies enforce by approximately 250,000 items or 1% of policies in force. Looking forward, the property liabilities business is positioned for growth. Margins are attractive, fewer rate increases should improve retention and the components of transformative growth are working, including new products, increased advertising, lower expenses and expanded distribution. This will enable us to achieve our strategic goal of increased Property-Liability market share. And now, I'll turn it over to Jess. Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. At its highest level, obviously to turn positive, PIF growth requires that we keep more of our existing customers, which is the retention component, and then we drive increased levels of new business. Maybe I'll talk about each of the pieces individually. Like we pointed out in the presentation, obviously a lot of the rate actions in the profit improvement plan that we've implemented over the last couple of years has had a pretty negative impact on customer retention. Now going forward, we would expect, just given where our margins are in auto, all other things being equal, we would expect to take less rate going forward, which will have a positive impact on retention, as it has in the past as we create less disruption in the book. But the other side of it is, we're not just going to rely on that. We've got actions in place in a number of areas, both in terms of improving the customer experience. Working with our customers, both through our agents, and our contact centers to help identify opportunities to improve affordability, and really kind of mitigate shopping activity from our own customers. So, we're focused on retention improving going forward, both kind of organically, I'll say through less rate, but we're also not sitting back. We're taking proactive actions to help offset some of the headwind that we've seen in retention. On the other side. On the new business standpoint, just to give you some context, we talked about the vast majority of markets being open for business somewhere between 75% and 80% of our premium volume. When you look at it nationally, those are markets that we are open for business. We're accelerating investments, and we've really seen some good production trends across all distribution channels. Our agents are productive, they're bundling at all-time high levels, which also will help retention. We believe over time we're continuing to see really good traction on the direct business and we think there's ongoing opportunity there. And then as I mentioned earlier, the National General acquisition and what we've been able to do both in the non-standard auto market, as well as in the independent agent space more broadly, is generating some good production trends. So, we feel good about that. We're focused on improving retention, while continuing to build on the growth momentum from a new business perspective, which has improved sequentially over the course of the year. And when those two things come together, that that's what will drive positive growth. Thanks, Greg. This is Mario. Let me take your questions in order. First, on retention, when we isolate and look at, we look at retention a whole bunch of different ways. When we look at retention in the agency channel, it's actually up year-over-year. So what's happening and what you see on Page 8 is predominantly a function of price increases, which I think have the biggest impact on retention. Just from an agent compensation perspective as you mentioned, we kind of changed and have been transforming the model for them to really align with what both we want to do strategically, but also the value that customers see from agent. So we've incented agents to drive more new business, deepen relationships with customers and we see that with kind of all-time high levels of bundling. And agents, we're really pleased with the performance of our agency force and how productive they are and they're going to be a key part of our growth plan going forward. But that's really not the driver of retention that you see on the page. In terms of the claims organization, that's an area where even though the -- when you look at the ratio, it's pretty flat, that's a function of just having higher average premium. We're investing in claims. We actually have been adding staff so that we can continue to build on our claims capabilities, pay what we owe, drive a higher level of customer satisfaction. And again, we look at those as growth levers every bit as much as profit and severity management levers, but nothing really from a claim standpoint driving the retention numbers. And as I said, as a matter of fact, we're adding resources and dollars in claims to help both support the growth that we want to achieve going forward, but enhance customer satisfaction and effectively continue to manage severity levels. Yes, 25 states now. Yes. So Greg, again I just reiterate where Tom started. We're really good at homeowners and we think there is a real opportunity for us to grow homeowners in part right now because of the disruption that exists in the market. There's just fewer competitors out there that are wanting to write new business and we want to take advantage of that opportunity. We feel good about where our pricing is. As you mentioned, average premiums have gone up pretty consistently at a double digit clip over the last several years to keep pace with inflation. But when you look at our profit trends and you pointed out our underlying combined ratio which is currently in the low 60s, I think that's reflective of our ability to stay on top of loss trends and write new homeowners business at an attractive margin. We target low 90s which generates really strong returns on capital. We think we can do that and grow the business across all the distribution channels. And I'll just end with the opportunity with Custom360 in the independent agent channel because I think that becomes additive to our Allstate agents and our ability to grow direct in the Allstate brand. We're in I believe 24 states with Custom360. Currently, that's a standard and preferred auto offering along with homeowners that leverages Allstate's data and mid-market capabilities to price and really design that product. So it's intended to be the same product that we go to market with in the Allstate brand. As you can imagine, in the independent agent space we're getting really good traction on our ability to lead with homeowners which enables us to not just write the homeowners but also capture the auto opportunity from a packaged perspective. So we feel really good about the go forward opportunity in the independent agent space, which I think from a National General perspective becomes additive to the great success we've had in growing the nonstandard auto business and is really another way that we can leverage our homeowner capabilities broadly across all three horses, I'll use Tom's term, to really grow that business and generate really attractive returns going forward. Not so much on cars. So, we had to raise auto insurance prices because the houses or the cars became worth. But people didn't really think about it that way. They do think about their home value. So we're comfortable with where we're at. Yes. The first just to be clear, the numbers you see on the page are Allstate brand. So there's just not that much nonstandard auto. There's more direct, but at least currently, again, not a meaningful impact in the trends. On a go forward basis, I guess, I'd broaden the statement a little bit, Yaron and say, the more new business we write, that first renewal period or the first policy period tends to be lower than the book overall. So the more new business volume we write, there will be some downward pressure on the overall retention rate. Current volumes aren't meaningful enough to really drive a significant impact. But you're right from that perspective. And then certainly in the non-standard auto space, we've seen it with National General as we broaden the risk appetite in the Allstate brand and kind of do the opposite of what we're doing in homeowners, take advantage and leverage National General's non-standard auto capabilities in the Allstate brand that will have an impact on retention. Again, magnitude, we'll have to call that out for you when we see it. But certainly that business tends to retain at lower levels because those customers just tend to shop more. So those things will have an impact on retention going forward. But I would say what you see in Page 8, pretty much a muted impact on those items at this point. Yes. Yaron, it's Mario, again. There is almost certainly a lag when you think about implementing a rate increase in auto. It takes six months for that to be implemented across the entirety of the book and then you'll earn it over the six months after that. So there is a lag in terms of the rate we've taken or the industry takes and the impact on retention. And you see that in our numbers. One of the things though that I point out is and we've been clear on this. We believe we will need to take less rate given where profitability is. But again, this is a state-by-state, market-by-market business. So when we need to take prices up to keep pace with loss trends, we're going to do that. And what you saw in the third quarter, about 70% of the rate that we took was in three states. It was in New York, New Jersey, and an increase we implemented in Texas. So we're going to continue to take rate where we need to. We just think there's going to be less of it. And again, we'll look to manage retention alongside that. Yes, the California rate was in the first quarter. New York and New Jersey were actually implemented in the third quarter. So -- and I believe it was over 18% in New York and 13.7 or 13.4 in New Jersey. So again, there's some pretty meaningful rates that we've implemented currently, again, to get those markets back to where they need to be from a margin perspective so we can open up to right new business. Yes. Maybe I'll start with where we don't, because I think it gets to the first part of your question. And two states in particular, Florida and California obviously really challenged homeowner markets that there's been a lot of pullback across the industry. Those are not states that we're looking to get bigger in. So certainly those would not be where we focus our growth efforts and then we'll continue to manage PML and coastal exposure to be within our risk appetite. But then once you kind of get away from that, really the rest of the country, particularly the middle part of the country is -- there's real opportunity for us to continue to grow homeowners. And that's not where you get the hurricanes or necessarily the wildfires. It's more severe weather, tornadoes, hail and so on. And what we found is a lot of competitors have pulled back in those states given severe weather experience. I think that's where our capabilities from a product, a pricing, a risk management perspective really enable us to take advantage of the disruption in the market and grow pretty broadly geographically and not have to kind of grow where, I guess where we can, because nobody else wants it, but actually grow where we think we can generate attractive returns. And that geographically is the vast majority of the country. And again, that's why I think being good at homeowners and having an effective system and operating model to write it and write it profitably is a real competitive advantage for us. And I think you see that in the growth trends really over the course of this year. Yes. I won't go into any state specific detail, but what I will say is we're open broadly. The 26% increase in new business that you saw was not concentrated in a handful of states. It was pretty broad as well, but so -- were the retention decline. So really it's a combination of all those things kind of working together. There's markets that grew in total. There's others that did not. But we're focused on having all of them turn positive at some point. And I think look at the long term number. We're down 2.7 points. We think it should be able to go up from there. So quarter-to-quarter we'll do full attribution on it. We're happy to talk about it. But it's the real drivers who just raise prices a lot, so a lot of people wouldn't shop. Yes, the only other thing I'd add, Josh, that makes it not as whimsical as you might think, is we have a lot of data on homeowners, both in terms of customers we've insured in the past and just on the homes across the country in general, which I think facilitates our ability to do what you described, and be really efficient - intelligently being able to price and manage the homeowner risk. So that's the other component I think that gets us and creates the ability to do what you, what you suggested"

Please go ahead, sir.\nBrent Vandermause: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team will provide perspective on our strategy and an update on our results. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2023 and other public documents for information on potential risks. As some of you know, this will be my final earnings call as the leader of our Investor Relations team since I will be transitioning to a new role. Investor Relations will be in the capable hands of Alastair Gobin, who will be a great partner for you all. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Wilson: Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time at Allstate. I'll provide an overview of results. Mario and Jess will go through operating performance, and then we'll address questions. Let's start on Slide 2. Allstate strategy has two components: increase personal property-liability market share and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right-hand side, you could see highlights in the second quarter. Net income was $301 million in a quarter with elevated catastrophes. The auto profit improvement plan is being successfully executed. National General continues on a 4-year profitable growth trajectory. The Homeowners business had good results with an improved underlying combined ratio and underwriting profit for the first six months of the year. Net investment income was up almost 17% over the prior year quarter as the fixed income portfolio continues to benefit from repositioning into longer duration and higher yielding assets. Protection Services has had another good quarter led by profitable growth in protection plans. Let's move to Slide 3 and show how that operational execution improved underlying results in the quarter. Revenues increased to $15.7 billion, reflecting higher average property liability earned premiums and that was mostly from rate increases in auto and homeowners insurance and increased net investment income. Net investment income for the second quarter was $712 million higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting that fixed income duration extension in 2022 and 2023. And then which also included lowering public equity holdings to take advantage of higher fixed income yields. Adjusted net income was $429 million or $1.61 per diluted share. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario for Property-Liability results.\nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. I'll start by covering Slide 4. On the top left of the table, you can see Property-Liability earned premiums of $13.3 billion increased 11.9% in the second quarter, driven by higher average premiums. The underwriting loss of $145 million improved by $1.9 billion compared to the prior year quarter due to improved underlying margins and lower catastrophes. The expense ratio of 21.3 was 0.8 points higher than prior year due to increased advertising as we continue to accelerate growth investments in rate adequate states and risk segments. The adjusted expense ratio, which excludes advertising costs and other non-core expenses was down 1.6 points in the quarter. The chart on the right depicts components of the 101.1 combined ratio. Catastrophe losses of $2.1 billion were 6.7 points favorable to the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 85.3 improved by 7.6 points compared to the prior year quarter with the improvement driven by higher average earned premium and moderating loss cost trends. Prior year reserve re-estimates, excluding catastrophes, had only a minor impact on current quarter results as favorable development in personal auto and homeowners insurance offset increases in personal umbrella liabilities and commercial auto reserves related to the transportation network contracts we began exiting in late 2022. Turning to Slide 5. You can see that we continue to successfully execute our profit improvement plan. The second quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 95.9 improved by 12.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The bars in the chart show consistent improvement in the quarter underlying combined ratio. I will note that we have adjusted 2022 and 2023 reported quarterly figures to reflect the updated average severity estimates as of the end of each of those years to remove the volatility related to intra-year severity adjustments. You can see that the auto business has seen six sequential quarters of underlying combined ratio improvement with an underlying combined ratio of 93.5 in the second quarter of 2024. The dark blue line in the chart shows how rate increases throughout 2022 and 2023 pushed average premiums above underlying losses and expenses represented by the light blue line starting in the second half of 2023. As average premium increases have outpaced loss and expense profitability has improved. Relative to the prior year quarter, average underlying loss and expense was 5.5% higher, as you can see in the second row of the table. This reflects higher current year incurred severity estimates primarily driven by bodily injury coverage, offset by lower accident frequency as well as higher advertising investments. Physical damage severity increases continue to moderate, while bodily injury continues to trend above inflation. Our claims team is focused on operational actions to mitigate the impact of inflationary trends, including identifying injuries earlier in the claims process to improve overall cycle time and focus on fast and fair resolution. Let's review Homeowners insurance on Slide 6 which had improved underlying performance. Allstate is an industry leader in Homeowners insurance, generating low 90s combined ratios over the last 10 years, as you can see in the chart on the right. This performance compares favorably to the industry, which experienced an underwriting loss and a 103 combined ratio over that same time period. Moving to the table on the left. Allstate Protection homeowners written premium increased by 13.7% compared to prior year, reflecting both higher average gross written premium per policy and policy in force growth of 2.2%. The second quarter combined ratio of 111.5% resulted in $375 million of underwriting losses compared to the $1.3 billion loss in the prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 63.5 improved by 4.1 points due to higher average premium and lower non-catastrophe claim frequency, which more than offset modest increases in non-catastrophe severity. For the first six months of 2024, Homeowners insurance generated an underwriting profit of $189 million. Moving to Slide 7. Let's discuss Transformative Growth our multiyear strategy to create a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. The 5 components of Transformative Growth are shown in the blue panels on the left side of the page, and we continue to make good progress on all of them. On the right-hand side, we show the tangible outcomes and proof points that we're delivering through this transformation, which improve the customer experience and support our objective to profitably grow market share over time. Two examples of those tangible outcomes that I'd highlight are the new affordable, simple and connected auto insurance product that was built on our new technology platform is now available in 19 states. And that in the second quarter, we increased our advertising investment by approximately $300 million to support growth efforts in states with attractive returns. Moving to Slide 8. We'll double-click on the multichannel distribution strategy, which enables us to serve customers based on their personal preferences. Our exclusive agents are available for local customers seeking personalized advice to fulfill broad insurance needs. Agency productivity has increased and bundling rates at point of sale are at all-time highs. Enhancements to direct capabilities and increased advertising attract more self-directed customers with new business production in the direct channel in the second quarter, nearly double that of the prior year. The National General acquisition significantly expanded the independent agent channel. If you look at the distribution of new business we write, shown in the pie charts on the bottom of slide, you can see the power of expanded customer access. The combination of broader distribution capabilities, increased advertising greater pricing sophistication and product expansion has resulted in a 90% increase in new business applications since 2020 with a much more balanced split across distribution channels. Now let's turn to Slide 9 to delve deeper into how the National General acquisition has allowed us to better serve customers who prefer to engage with independent agents. The $4 billion acquisition included a number of businesses, including personal auto insurance, group health, individual accident and health, and digital marketing platforms. Prior to the acquisition, we offered insurance in the independent agent channel through both the Allstate and Encompass brands, with the Encompass brand solely dedicated to selling through IAs. With the acquisition of National General, we now go to market in the independent agency channel, primarily through the National General brand. Through the ownership of National General since January of 2021, we have significantly increased the number of customers we protect through independent agents, having added almost 1.7 million policies in force reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 8% in policies over the past four years and bringing premiums written to over $5.1 billion for the first six months of this year. Underwriting margins remain attractive and National General is now one of the largest independent agent personal lines insurers with expansion into lower risk customer segments supporting additional growth going forward in the IA channel. Slide 10 reviews property liability policies in force for all brands. Given the successful execution of the Auto Insurance profit improvement plan, investments in growth will made in Allstate that offer attractive return opportunities. These higher growth investments led to a 17% increase in Personal Auto new business applications in the second quarter, as you can see at the top of the chart on the left. The green bars show the components of that growth in new policy sales. The first two bars reflect the drivers of the 23% increase in new business volume in the Allstate brand. Higher productivity per exclusive agents drove a 9% new business increase compared to prior year and advertising investments and enhancements to direct operations resulted in a 92% increase in the direct channel compared to the prior year. The last two green bars reflect national general growth in both the non-standard auto business and higher sales volume from the Custom360 middle market offering that we continue to roll out. On the right, you can see that total protection auto policies enforced decreased by 1.6% compared to prior year as the Allstate brand decrease was partially offset by growth at National General. Allstate brand auto policies in force decreased by 4.5% compared to prior year as policies lost from customer defections more than offset the increase in new policy sales. Allstate brand auto retention of 85.7 did improve by 0.2 points compared to prior year as the negative impact of large rate increases in 2022 and 2023 continues to moderate. National General growth of 548,000 policies in force offset almost 60% of the Allstate brand decrease. While margin improvement actions have negatively impacted policy growth, the were necessary to mitigate loss cost trends during a period of rapid loss cost inflation. And now I'll turn it over to Jess.\nJess Merten: All right. Thank you, Mario. Slide 11 details profitable growth in Protection Services. In the second quarter, revenues in these businesses increased to $773 million, which was 12.7% higher than the prior year quarter. This result was primarily driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans. Revenues in our Roadside business decreased 22.7% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact of exiting a large unprofitable wholesale account. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $55 million in the second quarter increased $14 million compared to the prior year quarter, with most businesses showing improvements. Profitable growth in Allstate Protection plans resulted in adjusted net income of $41 million, a $10 million increase compared to the prior year quarter as revenue growth and improved claims trends continue to benefit the bottom-line. Slide 12 provides additional insight into the shareholder value created by protection plans. Since acquiring SquareTrade in 2017 for $1.4 billion, this has become a significant growth platform with scale and attractive profitability. Protection Plans provides warranties for a wide range of products, including consumer electronics, computers and tablets, TVs, mobile phones, major appliances and furniture. The power of the Allstate brand has helped to secure partnerships with large retailers in North America. We sell Allstate Protection Plans at point of sale through successful retailers such as Costco, Home Depot, Sam's Club, Target and Walmart, all under the Allstate brand. We're also expanding internationally into Europe and Asia. As you can see from the charts to the right, broad distribution and customer-focused operational execution has resulted in rapid growth in this business. Revenue grown 20% compared to the same 12-month period in 2023, while returns have been strong. Adjusted net income over the last 12 months totaled $139 million and almost $700 million cumulatively since 2017. Now let's shift to Slide 13 to discuss investment results. Result again benefited from active portfolio management that seeks to optimize return per unit of risk across the enterprise. Net investment income, shown in the chart on the left, totaled $712 million in the quarter, which is $102 million above the second quarter of last year. Market-based income of $667 million, which is shown in blue, was $131 million above the prior year quarter as the fixed income portfolio continues to benefit from repositioning into longer duration and higher yielding assets. Performance-based income of $107 million, shown in black, was $20 million below the prior year quarter due to lower real estate investment results. The performance-based portfolio is constructed to enhance long-term returns and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected. On the right, you can see our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over a short-term and long-term horizon. The market-based portfolio delivers predictable earnings while the performance-based portfolio enhances risk and return and diversifies the $71 billion investment portfolio. Moving to Slide 14. The Health and Benefits business continues to perform well. Revenues of $620 million increased by $45 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by premium growth in group and individual health. Adjusted net income of $58 million in the second quarter was slightly higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting increased group health and employee benefits adjusted net income that was partially offset by a decrease in individual health. As a reminder, the decision to pursue a divestiture of these businesses was based on a belief that potential buyers with complementary products and capabilities will unlock value beyond what is achievable by Allstate. The process is progressing well and has confirmed our strategic logic. Slide 15 recaps Allstate strategy in this quarter's results. Auto and Homeowners insurance profitability has improved. National General is profitably growing policies in force. We're accelerating transformative growth to increase auto and homeowners' policies in force. Proactive risk and return management of the investment portfolio continues to generate value. And Protection Plans is expanding with broadened product offerings and distribution. We're confident that this strategy will continue to create value for our shareholders. And with that context, let's open the line for your questions.\nOperator: Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please.\nGregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. So for my first question, I'll focus on growth. And Tom, I know you've been talking about transformational growth now for several years. And we're seeing this strong increase in new issued applications. So I'm wondering if you might help us understand how you think that new issued application result is going to drive increased policies in force in the auto stats that we see in some of your supplements.\nTom Wilson: Good morning Greg. Thank you for both being here and paying attention over years, appreciate it. Mario talked about the growth by channel. And we highlighted National General this quarter because it's a $10 billion business on an annual basis. And we feel like the market is really not looking through that one in terms of growth as much. Transformative growth includes what we're doing in National General. But to your point, it really also includes remaking a lot of the business processes inside the Allstate brand. So let me make a couple of comments about that. And give it to Mario to talk about specific things he's doing in various geographies. It's just the most macro view growth driven by two factors, sell more, as you point out and keep more. And so we spent a bunch of time Mario talked about selling more. We feel good about the trajectory there. You can see the benefits of the increased advertising and direct volume Mario talked about. And that also will translate into increased growth in productivity in the Allstate agent channel as we roll it out. So the other question then is, of course, how many do you keep? And retention was up slightly in the quarter versus the prior year quarter. If you kind of look over the last 12 months, it's been reasonably flat in Auto Insurance. I assume you're talking about Auto Insurance, by the way, we can talk about Home as well because I think that's a great opportunity for us. But on Auto Insurance, it's been relatively flat and normally, you would expect as rate increases come down, you would expect retention to increase. It's not clear what that trend will be at this point in time. And the reason I say that is not that I think traditional economics of don't ask me to pay a lot more and more likely to stay breakdown. It's just that the price elasticity curves broke down when we raised prices over the last couple of years. So it's a little hard to tell what the tail on that will be because it's hard to figure out attribution of why did in the face of 33% increase in rates we were able to hold retention pretty well. Some have been -- maybe car people understood the cars worth more, maybe they had a bunch of cash the government gave them. Some of it's competitors were also raising rates. So you can't really do attribution as to why we are where we are. So looking forward, we said it's a little hard to tell exactly what retention will do in the future. I take Senate goes up because we are taking fewer price increases. That's almost -- it's pretty close to one to one in terms of movement retention rate and growth, which is really a good thing, obviously. But we're not waiting around to see what happens there. We're working on improving the customer experience. We have a goal of growing 20 million customer interactions on an annual basis by next year, and we're well along the goal on that. So we're doing a whole bunch of continuous improvement. We've got new tech tools out there, new products, all of which are designed around improving retention and growth. Mario, do you want to talk about specific aspects of growth in terms of states or something?\nMario Rizzo: Sure. Thanks for the question, Greg. So maybe the place I'd start like Tom said, retention is obviously critically important to growth, and we're pleased with the fact that retention is stabilizing. But we also recognize there's a handful of states that we have taken some pretty significant rate increases more recently, California, New York, New Jersey. Those are going to continue to have an impact on retention going forward. But absent those three states, we kind of like the trends that are emerging. But I want to talk a little bit about new business production and get at your question. So Greg, where I would start would be kind of how did we get here? And the reality is, as we've been implementing the auto profit improvement plan over the past couple of years, that's obviously being executed on a state-by-state, market-by-market basis. But as states have gotten to a rate adequate level, we've begun to lean in and invest more in growth to drive production in those states. And that would include things like unwinding underwriting guidelines to restrict business, increasing advertising spend, both nationally and locally. And as where we sit right now, as I'd say, about two-thirds of our states, the premium volume represented like two-thirds of our states, are what we would consider at profit target levels. And then there's about another 10% or so that are kind of on the path to getting there. So overall, we feel really good about the vast majority of country in terms of geographically where we're comfortable investing. And you see the momentum that's really been building over the course of the year. Last quarter, production was up about 9% in total. This quarter, it was up 17% as we further ramped up growth investments. And we're going to continue to do that. At the same time, you've seen us take less rate, which, as Tom mentioned, helps retention. But we're going to continue to be diligent about staying on top of loss cost trends really broadly across states. And as I mentioned, there are some states that aren't in that growth category right now that we've got to get to target levels of profitability. We're going to continue to focus on taking rates that are necessary there. And when we're successful, those will become additive to the parts of the country where we can invest. So that kind of got us to where we're at in terms of geography and new business and the good news is we're seeing the growth across brands and across channels.\nGregory Peters: Great. I guess in a related question as a follow-up -- my follow-up would be on the expense ratio side. You called out the increased advertising expense in the second quarter. I think it was 3 points of your property liability combined ratio. When we look forward, what kind of expectation do you have about how maybe the adjusted expense ratio is going to move through the balance of this year and sort of what your longer-term objectives are there?\nTom Wilson: Let me answer that both by first by going up and then coming down a little bit. So Transform Growth had 5 components that Mario walked through. We've -- on each of those, the underlying assumptions between whether that was a good thing to do or not, we've proven out. We haven't -- they all are not working all at the same time right now so that you're seeing the growth we think we can get, which is to increase market share. So we're confident we're going to increase market share in personal property liability. When you get into what's retention next quarter, what happens in new business exporter, we're confident that all of those things will work in the same direction. As it relates to expenses, we think we need to continue. I mean we wanted to affordable simple, connected protection. Affordable means low price. That means we're going to continue to reduce costs. And so we've got a whole bunch of things we're working on now that are -- we've been working on for a couple of years as you point out, that are starting to generate benefits. But we have more to go. Like we don't -- we think there's with the age of digitization and the things we can do in our business, we can still drive cost on. As it relates to advertising, the reason we broke that out separately is that, that does relate to the fact of we don't want people to be to miscommunicate to people that we think taking advertising down and making that lower is a good idea, because we think growth creates value for shareholders as long we're operating at attractive returns. We've got a good set of capabilities there. And I'd be happy to talk about that. If anybody wants to get there, but we're comfortable that we can continue to invest in growth, get good returns, lower expenses at the same time, increased market share, which then will lead to a re-rating of the earnings multiple.\nGregory Peters: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. I just had a question on, what you're seeing in terms of competitive trends in the Personal Auto market, both in terms of pricing and advertising. It seems like margins for most of the companies are getting closer to normal. So wondering if that, if you're starting to see some of them, get aggressive on price? I know certainly advertising spending has been going up a lot. But what are you seeing out there?\nTom Wilson: Let me talk about advertising and Mario, can jump in on pricing. And of course, there's a lot of competitors, but let's focus on the biggest competitors for time being a business is the ones that are mostly in play here. So from a -- as we were just talking about, growth is good for shareholders. It's good, because we're earning good returns. Secondly, we're leveraging capabilities over a broader capital base, which drives more shareholder value creation, and then that should lead to a re-rating other multiple. And then you say, what needs to be true for you to do good advertising and to head into a fight on that one. And first, you got to have a product that's differentiated and appeals to customers. So we have that with our new ASC Auto product. We know it from the close to quote ratios higher with product you've got to have -- you got to be getting attractive returns when we talked about that at length. You got to have a great brand because that increases consideration like if people view the first time people have heard of you your dollar advertisings done is effective, obviously, we a great brand and great consideration. You have to have broad access, and this, ties together with transforming growth. We advertise, you can go to exclusive agent, you can go on our website, you can go to a direct. So you want to make sure that however they want to come to, they had advertising dollars effectively used. Now I would say advertising today, though, is a game of precision, much as Auto Insurance pricing went through this great push on sophistication, those who are good at sophistication win. And you can see that when you look at the combined ratios of people like Allstate Progressive, Geico, we all have really good combined ratios, because we're sophisticated in how we price product. Same thing is true in advertising today. So you have to be good at search. And we don't just listen to ourselves. We had external reviews, and we're really good at search. You have to be good at a bidding strategy. How much you're bidding for Elite? We're good at bidding for Elite. It's not like we're perfect. We got other stuff we need to do. You got figure out how you're using different kind of messaging for different groups. And you can imagine with the refrain of number of media channels, number of messages you can do now, particularly with AI, the number of segments you have, your pricing sophistication, it gets complicated really fast. And we're really good at it. So when we go into this, and we're thinking about us increasing the advertising versus other people, you're like, well, how good are you? And we think we're good at it. If you look at where we are with Arity and our Telematics work, that's to really end run around having more information on who you bid on because we track 15% of the U.S. population they're driving. So we can decide how good a driver you are without even sticking a device on you or an app on your phone or a device in your car. So will competition increase in advertising, probably. Do I -- it will be from those carriers who have the same kind of capabilities we do. So we're fully up to winning that game. I think there will be some other people who hold back or even drop out because they can't -- they don't have the capabilities and expertise to do it. So that's where we are in the advertising, good for shareholders because it's good for growth. And we use the money effectively. Mario, do you want talk about pricing environment?\nMario Rizzo: Yes. And Jimmy, thanks for the question. I'll answer the question broadly, but I'd put a caveat around it that, obviously, what I'm going to say is going to vary by company and it's going to vary geographically because the business has just operated that way, and there's a lot of competitors in the market. But I would say, by and large, as we discussed this morning and as many of our competitors have reported profitability in auto is improving as loss cost trends have improved. And all of the things being equal, when that happens and margins are better. There's just less rate activity in the system, and that's what we're saying -- companies generally taking less rate than they were over the last couple of years. Again, that will vary by company. Some started later than others and are still catching up. Others are a little further along. But generally, we see less rate getting pushed through. And then certainly, that varies geographically as well. Having said that, I would just take that along with what Tom talked about in terms of advertising and say that when you take the totality of where we're positioned and what we're building with transformative Growth, we like where we're positioned in our ability to be able to increase growth investments and be successful in a competitive marketplace. That's what we're building, and we like our chances.\nJimmy Bhullar: And then just on the benefit sale, we're late in the year, and there hasn't been an announcement, but maybe talk a little bit about how the process is going. And I'm assuming it's probably not going to close this year, but are you still assuming the close within the next few months, even if it drags on to next year?\nJess Merten: Hi, Jimmy, it's Jess. First, I guess I would start by reminding everyone, the third great businesses. You saw it in the results that I covered. So we're really happy to continue to focus on execution in the operations. It might be helpful if I give you a little bit of a window into the process to help you understand of where we're at and where we're going. So if you think about our process, we started out with a preference for single transaction. But in the same note, we were unwilling to compromise value for that preference, right? So we spent a lot of time with a single transaction buyer that thought they could, in the end, change the terms and/or that we didn't have better options, quite frankly. So we spent a lot of time on a process there, and ultimately, what we decided was to work with other buyers. And that has created a delay in things, it just has. But we're confident that by making that switch, we'll get a better outcome. A better outcome for our shareholders, a better outcome for the businesses. So what I would say right now, and I don't want to get into timing of announcements to close, what I would say is that we're likely to be in a position to announce transactions this year, and you'll get more details about the what and the how, when those announcements come. But that's just a little bit of window into the process and why you still haven't heard anything, if that's helpful.\nJimmy Bhullar: And do you intend to sell a disposal of the entire unit eventually, even if it goes into pieces? Or are there some pieces you might decide to retain?\nJess Merte: We still intend to make the divestiture of the Health and Benefits segment.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nBob Huang: Hi. Good morning. Maybe one on homeowner. I think last year, when it comes to cat losses, severe convective storm was a one in 2018 event, if I remember correctly, which obviously was a headwind to your cat numbers. Just given how things are developing so far, curious how is it tracking this year? Is it going to be more of a worse than one in 2018 event? Just pace on what we have in the first half, curious in terms of like how are the weathers are developing for the Homeowner side.\nTom Wilson: Bob, it's Tom. Thanks for the question on Homeowners. I would look at Homeowners on a longer-term basis than one year. So if you look over the last 11 years, we've made three-quarter of the profit that whole industry has made because we have a pretty sophisticated business model, we've talked about before and be happy to go into, but we're good at homeowners. It's currently turning into a, I guess, what we do domestically, we called the hard market, but a lot of people are bailing on growth in that market because they were either part of the 25% or they were part of the negative amount that led to us every three quarters. So that entire profit pool when we have less than 10% of the total business. So we think that is a great growth opportunity. As it relates to this year, too hard to predict whether. It comes and goes. For the first six months, we made money on an underwriting basis. That makes me feel better than last year, where we didn't make money for the whole year, prior 10 years. We've made money in each of those 10 years. So I feel good about our business model. As it relates to any individual quarter, they're keeping for us is be there for our customers. Like when I got a problem and we're good at getting there fast. We want to be there to take care of their claims. They tell their friends. Our Homeowners as you saw the unit growth is up. It's particularly -- we're doing extremely well in our Allstate agents with bundling customers. So other people are interested in that segment. We're just killing it right now on cross line sales. So we feel good about that. Some of that is the hard market. Some of it's great relationships. Some of it is the product and the pricing we have it all kind of comes together. So we like the business. We think it's got good long-term growth potential. And we -- on a quarterly basis, I wouldn't get too focused on whether it's up or down this second quarter is -- you can decide it's either higher or lower depending on which period of time you wanted to evaluate it against. And so I would just say focus on the long-term results from it.\nBob Huang: Okay. Thanks. My second question, a little bit of a shot in the dark here. For the DOJ lawsuit for National General, there has been precedent where under FIRREA Civil Enforcement Actions, where SEC can potentially get involved under the current litigation environment, do you expect that the National General case should get SEC involved at some point down the road? I'm not sure if that's the question you can answer at this point.\nTom Wilson: Well, we don't give a lot of specifics on active litigation, obviously. And I certainly can't speak for what other people want to do when we have -- I don't know what the SEC will or will not choose to do. What I can give us a little bit of information. This is -- the lawsuit is in reference to a lender-placed insurance program, so that stuff sold through agents. It's focused on auto insurance. Our program was transparent. We borrowers are treated fairly. And we're confident that we will prevail in this and at the lawsuits will have no impact on our ongoing business.\nBob Huang: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from BMO. Your question, please.\nJack Matten: Hi. Good morning. This is Jack on for Mike. Just a follow-up on the advertising spend strategy. I'm curious how your strategy and focus today compares to the last cycle? And more specifically, how much of your ad spend has historically been geared toward direct-to-consumer targeted sales versus supporting your agents? And then how is that evolving today given the success of your transformative growth strategy in your lower expense base?\nTom Wilson: Jack, I would say that the third component of transformative growth was increase the sophistication and investment in new customer acquisition. We didn't talk about it here much, but we've gotten much more sophisticated versus the last time we did this. But I think other people have too. So I'm not -- like I don't want conclude we're 5 miles ahead of everybody else but we're good. And so we feel much better about our sophistication. The way in which we go through the allocation of investment is think about it as upper and lower funnel, upper funnel being get the brand out there, do some TV advertisements to make sure people are considering you when they're getting insurance. So you'll notice that more advertising on TV. Then there's what we call lower funnel, which is you're on the website, you're cruising around for a new car, and we pop something into your web browsing that says, hey, what about Allstate or we use addressable TV to do it. So there's lots of different ways we try to do, what I would call, lower funnel. And the first one, you do because we are off a little bit for the last couple of years in terms of down in advertising, we've increased our upper funnel some just because we want people to remember there, got a great brand because we've been investing in it forever. It's got great unaided recognition, and we want to keep investing in that. The biggest portion of our increase would be in the lower funnel piece. That gets tightly tied to what Mario described, which is really by state by market, by risk class, and it's highly sophisticated in terms of how we do that. As it relates to both of those upper and lower funnel work for both all of our -- all of the Allstate brand channels, so agents and direct. Our agents also do some of their own lead generation, whether they go to mortgage brokers or other people in their local areas and buy leads. I think there is an area where we need to bring increased sophistication to it because we're just better at doing it globally than you would be if you live it to Boeing or something like that. So there's increased sophistication there. But think of it as a large machine has got a number of different levers we can pull, and we have -- it has got good gauges on it, so we can tell what's coming out on the other end. And so we're constantly turning and dialing those levers and watching the gauges so that we beat our current competition.\nJack Matten: That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears to auto loss cost trends. If you look at the average underlying loss you disclosed, it's now running slightly lower compared to 2023. I guess does that mean you're now seeing frequency benefits more than offsetting higher severity. And I'm curious how you view the sustainability of current favorable frequency trends. I know last quarter, you mentioned favorable weather. Just curious how those pieces are moving.\nTom Wilson: Jack, I'll let Mario jump into both frequency and severity and by coverage. I can just say it's nice to have it be about halfway through the call on loss costs and be talking about growth, which is much more optimistic. A year ago that would have been in the first, second and third question. So it's a good question. Mario will go to it, but I'm happy we're talking about growth because we think that's where we're going to create a lot of shareholder value. So Mario over to you.\nMario Rizzo: Sure. Thanks, Jack. I guess the place I'd start is as much as we dig into the components of profitability. They're all important, but we should lose sight of the fact that the way we manage the auto business is to generate mid-90s combined ratios across the entirety of the system. And we use levers like rates and we look at pure premium, whether that's frequency and severity and expenses, they all matter. And certainly, the loss trend helps inform what we need to do with some of the other levers. What I would say, as I mentioned, the negative trend, the negative 0.8% that you see in the supplement as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's a little bit of noise in in there terms of year-over-year comparisons because we were moving severity targets around intra-quarter last year. So the adjusted numbers, it's slightly positive, it's about 1%. So not all that different. But I would say it's -- favorable frequency has continued through the first half of the year has been offset by higher severity predominantly in bodily injury, which continues to run above inflation and on the physical damage side, we continue see some good tailwinds with things like used car prices and stabilizing repair costs and so on. But that's kind of the overall loss trend that we're reacting to. In terms of the sustainability of frequency, it's a really difficult question to answer. Things like weather and geography risk segments all come into play. Frequency has been better than it was a year ago. When we look at our telematics data, which gives us a lot of rich information, miles driven per operators up a little bit but trips are shorter. So that could be having an impact on frequency. Weather favorably impacted frequency in the first quarter. And the other thing I'd say is as we've been looking to improve profitability over the last couple of years and not growing, the risk segmentation and the mix of our auto book has shifted around a bit to higher lifetime value, let lower frequency type business, that's having an impact as well. So there's a lot of moving parts in there. One thing I will say is as we go forward and write more new business, that will impact prospective frequency trends, but I'll go back to where I started. We manage the system in its entirety to generate mid-90s combined ratio profitability, and we're going to continue to do that despite however frequency bounces around.\nJack Matten: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you, good morning. I wanted to go back to growth or continue to focus on growth. I think ever since the Transformative Growth program was announced and launched. Clearly, you've had some issues with COVID and the aftermath of COVID. But now that we're hopefully starting to come out of that transitionary period and all the levers from Transformative Growth are kind of kicking in. Can you maybe help us think through -- I'm not even asking about a one or two-year horizon, but maybe over the cycle, what you think reasonable growth expectations should be on a PIF basis for Allstate. And I say this also in the context of I think we see some of industry leaders in growth, achieving pretty consistent, call it, high -- mid-to-high single-digit growth in PIF. Do you think that you can be at that level?\nTom Wilson: So we haven't given out a target for PIF growth, but it's the right way to think about it. Because when you're looking at market share, a lot of times, market share is done in the industry by premiums. Also charge, more have fewer customers and presumably could increase your market share on that basis, that's not our goal. Our goal is PIF growth. If you want to assume that, if you said okay, the U.S. economy in terms of number of cars, house and stuff like that, it's going to be a low single-digit increase, I don't know. So 1% there's not going to be a whole bunch of more new cars in houses in the United States. And so obviously, PIF growth has got to be higher than that. And it is higher than that you can see right now in Homeowners because we're winning in that business. When you look at how far up is up, we don't have a limit on that, if you look at National General, which is one of the reasons we called it out, it's got every bit as good a growth as some of those our competitors who get much higher valuations than we do. And it's got really good profitability. So we know how to do it. And the question is how do you translate it into? And what is the timing? We think there's great growth potential here. And that when you put on, just call it, -- if you take 1% for the overall growth in assets in the United States. You put on top of that what would be modest increases in premiums then you should get revenue growth which is above 5%. And so what does that turn into? You can do the math as well as we can. But we think there's great potential here. When you look at other people, we don't think they figured out how to turn lead into gold. They're just really good at what they do. We think we can be every bit, as good in the Allstate brand and growing that business. Particularly now that we've gotten direct, what I would say is improved and unleashed that. And you can see that from Mario's charts on how much new business we're writing there. So we think there's lots of potential, like we're very optimistic, but we don't have -- here's our magic number that we're going to get to. But whatever the number is, it would lead a higher valuation of earnings than we currently have.\nYaron Kinar: Same question. Does the company have reps and warranties insurance associated with the NatGen acquisition that's still in effect?\nTom Wilson: If you're relating to the DOJ lawsuit, I don't think that will impact what eventually happens. But let me just reiterate, we're really confident in where we are with that claim, we put it that way.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just talk about within the auto underlying loss ratio. If there's any way to size if there was any one time or unsustainable benefit from frequency in there, one of your peers had called out, I think it was a 2.5 point benefit from unsustainable factors the quarter. I wonder if you could give us any insight in terms of, if any, of the improvement was driven by something that is unsustainable within the auto business?\nTom Wilson: No. Let me give you a little -- I'll give you the summary and then go through Mario you can jump in here front. I don't know how you determine what's sustainable or not sustainable in frequency. Examples, if it -- in the winter, if it snows at 3 p.m., and it's kind of wet and then the temperature drops quickly and it turns the ice by time you get to 5:30 rush hour, a bunch of cars getting accidents. If it snows at 2 a.m., it doesn't matter so much. So I'm not really sure how you -- and that's just one example of the myriad of things that Mario talked about how far are you driving? How often do you drive? How fast you drive? What city driving? Who else drives? Like I don't know how you -- I don't know if they -- I don't know who it was on that remember said that, but I'm not sure how we would be able to with our math and the precision that we were being able to determine what's sustainable or unsustainable. What I would come back to is what Mario said, we price on what it is. So what it is, is what we factor in. Just the frequency goes down in a quarter, we don't suddenly decrease rates. Just like if it goes up in a quarter, we don't suddenly increase rates. We price to get a mid-90s combined ratio in auto insurance, and that's what we'll keep doing.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. That's helpful. Understood. It is pretty complex to do that. So that's fair. My follow-up question is just on the ad spend? And just I think in the past, you've shown -- I think it was the states that are under a 96 combined. I guess, I'm assuming that clearly went up this quarter. And I guess I'm wondering, are there any states where you're holding back on ad spend? And if so, could you just size how big those are as a percentage of the total book?\nTom Wilson: I'll let Mario answer the percentage question. I would say in hold back -- I was trying -- think of it as a lever that dialed you turned. Some states were wide open and testing really high levels. Other states were at what we think is appropriate there. So we're constantly managing and testing learning in a live market on how much we bid on stuff. I mean there's just -- it's very sophisticated. So it's not like there's a go or no go level. But there is, to your point, important from a macro standpoint, like how many states you're making money.\nMario Rizzo: Yes. And David, what I'd say -- I'd go back to what I said earlier, as we look at that kind of same mix of states, about two-thirds in terms of premium volume of states are at or below our target combined ratio. And I'd say about another 10% or so are on the path to getting there with rate that we've already approved. I guess there's a handful of states that that we're not leaning in, and that's true beyond just the advertising spend, but it would be around things like underwriting guidelines and so on. As much as we've talked about California, New York, New Jersey. California, we got approval for a 30% rate. We are writing new business across all channels in California. As a matter of fact, we filed an additional 6.9% rate to stay ahead of the loss trend because you don't want to get behind in California. But we are now writing in California, and we're spending some marketing dollars there. The two that on the other side of the country, New York and New Jersey are ones that we're still effectively managing what we write. And we're writing very low volumes of business. Having said that, we've gotten rate approvals in New York. We're in active conversations with the department on a 24% rate that we filed that we hope to get resolution on hopefully reasonably soon. And then we'll revisit that stance. And in New Jersey, we got rate approved at the end of last year. We just implemented another low teens rate in July, and we've got another one coming in December. And as we evaluate where that positions us we'll reassess our risk appetite and how much we want to invest. And I'll go back to saying what I've said multiple times is our objective function is to be able to write in every state. But the reality is we need to see a path to attractive returns and profitability to be able to do that once we get there, then we'll expand our appetite across geographies.\nTom Wilson: I would just add a couple of things. First, I don't think we'll ever be at 100%. But I also that that the high-growth competitors that your competitor, I guess, you're comparing us to, it probably has the same situation. Like not everything goes well in every state in this business. So I can see what people are trying to do. You're trying to triangulate between the gap of a small decrease in auto insurance to what's the increase is going to be and how does that translate into the increase in valuation multiple. Appropriate thing, we're focused on it as well. I would just say that the gap between the current growth and what potential is probably narrower than the gap that between the valuation, like our valuation multiple could be substantially higher even with small moves in the growth rate. You have to decide what you think that's worth and whether you want to pay for it or not. But I think that focusing -- it's not going to be a one-to-one thing, and it's not all going to happen at the same time. But we're confident we can grow like we know how to run this business.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vikram Gandhi from HSBC. Your question, please. Vikram, you might have your phone on mute. We're still not hearing you. Would you like me to\u2026\nTom Wilson: Why don't we go to the next question?\nOperator: All right. Our question then comes from the line of Charles Lederer from Citi. Your question please.\nCharles Lederer: Hi, can you talk about the new issued app mix on Slide 8, I guess how does your customer appetite differ across channels as you open things back up? And how do you see that impacting your margins given direct tends to have a higher upfront expense ratio as I understand it?\nTom Wilson: First, I would say we want all customers all locations or most locations, but all risk levels. Mario, do you want to talk about maybe specialist, not general or non-standard.\nMario Rizzo: Yes, Charlie, I'd say from a channel perspective, like in the Allstate brand, we have differentiated pricing between agency and direct. So we have we have the ability to do that to match the cost of doing business in the channel with the price that we charge. In terms of underwriting risk appetite, we write in standard and preferred across the entirety of the risk segment. And if we have the right price in the agent channel, we're right in the agent channel, and we'll also write it indirect. So there's very few exceptions in terms of different underwriting standards across channels. In terms of brands, the one risk segment that I think is new in the sense of we acquired it when we acquired National General is the nonstandard auto business, which historically Allstate really didn't participate in, in a meaningful way. That's a very well-run business. That's the lion's share currently of the nonstandard auto premium, generating really strong growth unit growth just under 12% with really strong profitability. And the one thing I'd say on that segment of business, there tend to be a lot of shoppers in that segment. So you can turn growth on and off a lot more rapidly. You tend to be able to reprice the book pretty quickly because the retention is lower. And I think that's become a real growth lever for us. As you can see in our numbers, we've been able to grow that business grow it profitably because we now have the right capabilities to write in that segment, which we didn't have when we started transformative growth. So but we're -- as Tom mentioned, we're positioned to write across channels, across brand and equally importantly, risk segments through National General in nonstandard Auto. But now, as I've talked about, Custom360 and rolling out middle market standard preferred and homeowner product, we can go upmarket in the independent agent channel as well. But we're positioned to write across the entirety of system.\nTom Wilson: Okay. Thank you all for spending your time with us as we move forward, we'll keep doing what do well, which is to serve our customers. We're going work on accelerating our growth in the profit liability business, making sure we're proactively investing and we didn't have spent a lot of time on that today, but we've had really great results in our investment portfolio. And then expanding protection offerings through great platforms like Protection Plans. Thank you all. We'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "content": "All right. Thank you, Mario. Slide 11 details profitable growth in Protection Services. In the second quarter, revenues in these businesses increased to $773 million, which was 12.7% higher than the prior year quarter. This result was primarily driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans. Revenues in our Roadside business decreased 22.7% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact of exiting a large unprofitable wholesale account. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $55 million in the second quarter increased $14 million compared to the prior year quarter, with most businesses showing improvements. Profitable growth in Allstate Protection plans resulted in adjusted net income of $41 million, a $10 million increase compared to the prior year quarter as revenue growth and improved claims trends continue to benefit the bottom-line. Slide 12 provides additional insight into the shareholder value created by protection plans. Since acquiring SquareTrade in 2017 for $1.4 billion, this has become a significant growth platform with scale and attractive profitability. Protection Plans provides warranties for a wide range of products, including consumer electronics, computers and tablets, TVs, mobile phones, major appliances and furniture. The power of the Allstate brand has helped to secure partnerships with large retailers in North America. We sell Allstate Protection Plans at point of sale through successful retailers such as Costco, Home Depot, Sam's Club, Target and Walmart, all under the Allstate brand. We're also expanding internationally into Europe and Asia. As you can see from the charts to the right, broad distribution and customer-focused operational execution has resulted in rapid growth in this business. Revenue grown 20% compared to the same 12-month period in 2023, while returns have been strong. Adjusted net income over the last 12 months totaled $139 million and almost $700 million cumulatively since 2017. Now let's shift to Slide 13 to discuss investment results. Result again benefited from active portfolio management that seeks to optimize return per unit of risk across the enterprise. Net investment income, shown in the chart on the left, totaled $712 million in the quarter, which is $102 million above the second quarter of last year. Market-based income of $667 million, which is shown in blue, was $131 million above the prior year quarter as the fixed income portfolio continues to benefit from repositioning into longer duration and higher yielding assets. Performance-based income of $107 million, shown in black, was $20 million below the prior year quarter due to lower real estate investment results. The performance-based portfolio is constructed to enhance long-term returns and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected. On the right, you can see our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over a short-term and long-term horizon. The market-based portfolio delivers predictable earnings while the performance-based portfolio enhances risk and return and diversifies the $71 billion investment portfolio. Moving to Slide 14. The Health and Benefits business continues to perform well. Revenues of $620 million increased by $45 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by premium growth in group and individual health. Adjusted net income of $58 million in the second quarter was slightly higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting increased group health and employee benefits adjusted net income that was partially offset by a decrease in individual health. As a reminder, the decision to pursue a divestiture of these businesses was based on a belief that potential buyers with complementary products and capabilities will unlock value beyond what is achievable by Allstate. The process is progressing well and has confirmed our strategic logic. Slide 15 recaps Allstate strategy in this quarter's results. Auto and Homeowners insurance profitability has improved. National General is profitably growing policies in force. We're accelerating transformative growth to increase auto and homeowners' policies in force. Proactive risk and return management of the investment portfolio continues to generate value. And Protection Plans is expanding with broadened product offerings and distribution. We're confident that this strategy will continue to create value for our shareholders. And with that context, let's open the line for your questions. Hi, Jimmy, it's Jess. First, I guess I would start by reminding everyone, the third great businesses. You saw it in the results that I covered. So we're really happy to continue to focus on execution in the operations. It might be helpful if I give you a little bit of a window into the process to help you understand of where we're at and where we're going. So if you think about our process, we started out with a preference for single transaction. But in the same note, we were unwilling to compromise value for that preference, right? So we spent a lot of time with a single transaction buyer that thought they could, in the end, change the terms and/or that we didn't have better options, quite frankly. So we spent a lot of time on a process there, and ultimately, what we decided was to work with other buyers. And that has created a delay in things, it just has. But we're confident that by making that switch, we'll get a better outcome. A better outcome for our shareholders, a better outcome for the businesses. So what I would say right now, and I don't want to get into timing of announcements to close, what I would say is that we're likely to be in a position to announce transactions this year, and you'll get more details about the what and the how, when those announcements come. But that's just a little bit of window into the process and why you still haven't heard anything, if that's helpful."

            "name": "Tom Wilson",
            "content": "Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time at Allstate. I'll provide an overview of results. Mario and Jess will go through operating performance, and then we'll address questions. Let's start on Slide 2. Allstate strategy has two components: increase personal property-liability market share and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right-hand side, you could see highlights in the second quarter. Net income was $301 million in a quarter with elevated catastrophes. The auto profit improvement plan is being successfully executed. National General continues on a 4-year profitable growth trajectory. The Homeowners business had good results with an improved underlying combined ratio and underwriting profit for the first six months of the year. Net investment income was up almost 17% over the prior year quarter as the fixed income portfolio continues to benefit from repositioning into longer duration and higher yielding assets. Protection Services has had another good quarter led by profitable growth in protection plans. Let's move to Slide 3 and show how that operational execution improved underlying results in the quarter. Revenues increased to $15.7 billion, reflecting higher average property liability earned premiums and that was mostly from rate increases in auto and homeowners insurance and increased net investment income. Net investment income for the second quarter was $712 million higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting that fixed income duration extension in 2022 and 2023. And then which also included lowering public equity holdings to take advantage of higher fixed income yields. Adjusted net income was $429 million or $1.61 per diluted share. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario for Property-Liability results. Good morning Greg. Thank you for both being here and paying attention over years, appreciate it. Mario talked about the growth by channel. And we highlighted National General this quarter because it's a $10 billion business on an annual basis. And we feel like the market is really not looking through that one in terms of growth as much. Transformative growth includes what we're doing in National General. But to your point, it really also includes remaking a lot of the business processes inside the Allstate brand. So let me make a couple of comments about that. And give it to Mario to talk about specific things he's doing in various geographies. It's just the most macro view growth driven by two factors, sell more, as you point out and keep more. And so we spent a bunch of time Mario talked about selling more. We feel good about the trajectory there. You can see the benefits of the increased advertising and direct volume Mario talked about. And that also will translate into increased growth in productivity in the Allstate agent channel as we roll it out. So the other question then is, of course, how many do you keep? And retention was up slightly in the quarter versus the prior year quarter. If you kind of look over the last 12 months, it's been reasonably flat in Auto Insurance. I assume you're talking about Auto Insurance, by the way, we can talk about Home as well because I think that's a great opportunity for us. But on Auto Insurance, it's been relatively flat and normally, you would expect as rate increases come down, you would expect retention to increase. It's not clear what that trend will be at this point in time. And the reason I say that is not that I think traditional economics of don't ask me to pay a lot more and more likely to stay breakdown. It's just that the price elasticity curves broke down when we raised prices over the last couple of years. So it's a little hard to tell what the tail on that will be because it's hard to figure out attribution of why did in the face of 33% increase in rates we were able to hold retention pretty well. Some have been -- maybe car people understood the cars worth more, maybe they had a bunch of cash the government gave them. Some of it's competitors were also raising rates. So you can't really do attribution as to why we are where we are. So looking forward, we said it's a little hard to tell exactly what retention will do in the future. I take Senate goes up because we are taking fewer price increases. That's almost -- it's pretty close to one to one in terms of movement retention rate and growth, which is really a good thing, obviously. But we're not waiting around to see what happens there. We're working on improving the customer experience. We have a goal of growing 20 million customer interactions on an annual basis by next year, and we're well along the goal on that. So we're doing a whole bunch of continuous improvement. We've got new tech tools out there, new products, all of which are designed around improving retention and growth. Mario, do you want to talk about specific aspects of growth in terms of states or something? Let me answer that both by first by going up and then coming down a little bit. So Transform Growth had 5 components that Mario walked through. We've -- on each of those, the underlying assumptions between whether that was a good thing to do or not, we've proven out. We haven't -- they all are not working all at the same time right now so that you're seeing the growth we think we can get, which is to increase market share. So we're confident we're going to increase market share in personal property liability. When you get into what's retention next quarter, what happens in new business exporter, we're confident that all of those things will work in the same direction. As it relates to expenses, we think we need to continue. I mean we wanted to affordable simple, connected protection. Affordable means low price. That means we're going to continue to reduce costs. And so we've got a whole bunch of things we're working on now that are -- we've been working on for a couple of years as you point out, that are starting to generate benefits. But we have more to go. Like we don't -- we think there's with the age of digitization and the things we can do in our business, we can still drive cost on. As it relates to advertising, the reason we broke that out separately is that, that does relate to the fact of we don't want people to be to miscommunicate to people that we think taking advertising down and making that lower is a good idea, because we think growth creates value for shareholders as long we're operating at attractive returns. We've got a good set of capabilities there. And I'd be happy to talk about that. If anybody wants to get there, but we're comfortable that we can continue to invest in growth, get good returns, lower expenses at the same time, increased market share, which then will lead to a re-rating of the earnings multiple. Let me talk about advertising and Mario, can jump in on pricing. And of course, there's a lot of competitors, but let's focus on the biggest competitors for time being a business is the ones that are mostly in play here. So from a -- as we were just talking about, growth is good for shareholders. It's good, because we're earning good returns. Secondly, we're leveraging capabilities over a broader capital base, which drives more shareholder value creation, and then that should lead to a re-rating other multiple. And then you say, what needs to be true for you to do good advertising and to head into a fight on that one. And first, you got to have a product that's differentiated and appeals to customers. So we have that with our new ASC Auto product. We know it from the close to quote ratios higher with product you've got to have -- you got to be getting attractive returns when we talked about that at length. You got to have a great brand because that increases consideration like if people view the first time people have heard of you your dollar advertisings done is effective, obviously, we a great brand and great consideration. You have to have broad access, and this, ties together with transforming growth. We advertise, you can go to exclusive agent, you can go on our website, you can go to a direct. So you want to make sure that however they want to come to, they had advertising dollars effectively used. Now I would say advertising today, though, is a game of precision, much as Auto Insurance pricing went through this great push on sophistication, those who are good at sophistication win. And you can see that when you look at the combined ratios of people like Allstate Progressive, Geico, we all have really good combined ratios, because we're sophisticated in how we price product. Same thing is true in advertising today. So you have to be good at search. And we don't just listen to ourselves. We had external reviews, and we're really good at search. You have to be good at a bidding strategy. How much you're bidding for Elite? We're good at bidding for Elite. It's not like we're perfect. We got other stuff we need to do. You got figure out how you're using different kind of messaging for different groups. And you can imagine with the refrain of number of media channels, number of messages you can do now, particularly with AI, the number of segments you have, your pricing sophistication, it gets complicated really fast. And we're really good at it. So when we go into this, and we're thinking about us increasing the advertising versus other people, you're like, well, how good are you? And we think we're good at it. If you look at where we are with Arity and our Telematics work, that's to really end run around having more information on who you bid on because we track 15% of the U.S. population they're driving. So we can decide how good a driver you are without even sticking a device on you or an app on your phone or a device in your car. So will competition increase in advertising, probably. Do I -- it will be from those carriers who have the same kind of capabilities we do. So we're fully up to winning that game. I think there will be some other people who hold back or even drop out because they can't -- they don't have the capabilities and expertise to do it. So that's where we are in the advertising, good for shareholders because it's good for growth. And we use the money effectively. Mario, do you want talk about pricing environment? Bob, it's Tom. Thanks for the question on Homeowners. I would look at Homeowners on a longer-term basis than one year. So if you look over the last 11 years, we've made three-quarter of the profit that whole industry has made because we have a pretty sophisticated business model, we've talked about before and be happy to go into, but we're good at homeowners. It's currently turning into a, I guess, what we do domestically, we called the hard market, but a lot of people are bailing on growth in that market because they were either part of the 25% or they were part of the negative amount that led to us every three quarters. So that entire profit pool when we have less than 10% of the total business. So we think that is a great growth opportunity. As it relates to this year, too hard to predict whether. It comes and goes. For the first six months, we made money on an underwriting basis. That makes me feel better than last year, where we didn't make money for the whole year, prior 10 years. We've made money in each of those 10 years. So I feel good about our business model. As it relates to any individual quarter, they're keeping for us is be there for our customers. Like when I got a problem and we're good at getting there fast. We want to be there to take care of their claims. They tell their friends. Our Homeowners as you saw the unit growth is up. It's particularly -- we're doing extremely well in our Allstate agents with bundling customers. So other people are interested in that segment. We're just killing it right now on cross line sales. So we feel good about that. Some of that is the hard market. Some of it's great relationships. Some of it is the product and the pricing we have it all kind of comes together. So we like the business. We think it's got good long-term growth potential. And we -- on a quarterly basis, I wouldn't get too focused on whether it's up or down this second quarter is -- you can decide it's either higher or lower depending on which period of time you wanted to evaluate it against. And so I would just say focus on the long-term results from it. Well, we don't give a lot of specifics on active litigation, obviously. And I certainly can't speak for what other people want to do when we have -- I don't know what the SEC will or will not choose to do. What I can give us a little bit of information. This is -- the lawsuit is in reference to a lender-placed insurance program, so that stuff sold through agents. It's focused on auto insurance. Our program was transparent. We borrowers are treated fairly. And we're confident that we will prevail in this and at the lawsuits will have no impact on our ongoing business. Jack, I would say that the third component of transformative growth was increase the sophistication and investment in new customer acquisition. We didn't talk about it here much, but we've gotten much more sophisticated versus the last time we did this. But I think other people have too. So I'm not -- like I don't want conclude we're 5 miles ahead of everybody else but we're good. And so we feel much better about our sophistication. The way in which we go through the allocation of investment is think about it as upper and lower funnel, upper funnel being get the brand out there, do some TV advertisements to make sure people are considering you when they're getting insurance. So you'll notice that more advertising on TV. Then there's what we call lower funnel, which is you're on the website, you're cruising around for a new car, and we pop something into your web browsing that says, hey, what about Allstate or we use addressable TV to do it. So there's lots of different ways we try to do, what I would call, lower funnel. And the first one, you do because we are off a little bit for the last couple of years in terms of down in advertising, we've increased our upper funnel some just because we want people to remember there, got a great brand because we've been investing in it forever. It's got great unaided recognition, and we want to keep investing in that. The biggest portion of our increase would be in the lower funnel piece. That gets tightly tied to what Mario described, which is really by state by market, by risk class, and it's highly sophisticated in terms of how we do that. As it relates to both of those upper and lower funnel work for both all of our -- all of the Allstate brand channels, so agents and direct. Our agents also do some of their own lead generation, whether they go to mortgage brokers or other people in their local areas and buy leads. I think there is an area where we need to bring increased sophistication to it because we're just better at doing it globally than you would be if you live it to Boeing or something like that. So there's increased sophistication there. But think of it as a large machine has got a number of different levers we can pull, and we have -- it has got good gauges on it, so we can tell what's coming out on the other end. And so we're constantly turning and dialing those levers and watching the gauges so that we beat our current competition. Jack, I'll let Mario jump into both frequency and severity and by coverage. I can just say it's nice to have it be about halfway through the call on loss costs and be talking about growth, which is much more optimistic. A year ago that would have been in the first, second and third question. So it's a good question. Mario will go to it, but I'm happy we're talking about growth because we think that's where we're going to create a lot of shareholder value. So Mario over to you. So we haven't given out a target for PIF growth, but it's the right way to think about it. Because when you're looking at market share, a lot of times, market share is done in the industry by premiums. Also charge, more have fewer customers and presumably could increase your market share on that basis, that's not our goal. Our goal is PIF growth. If you want to assume that, if you said okay, the U.S. economy in terms of number of cars, house and stuff like that, it's going to be a low single-digit increase, I don't know. So 1% there's not going to be a whole bunch of more new cars in houses in the United States. And so obviously, PIF growth has got to be higher than that. And it is higher than that you can see right now in Homeowners because we're winning in that business. When you look at how far up is up, we don't have a limit on that, if you look at National General, which is one of the reasons we called it out, it's got every bit as good a growth as some of those our competitors who get much higher valuations than we do. And it's got really good profitability. So we know how to do it. And the question is how do you translate it into? And what is the timing? We think there's great growth potential here. And that when you put on, just call it, -- if you take 1% for the overall growth in assets in the United States. You put on top of that what would be modest increases in premiums then you should get revenue growth which is above 5%. And so what does that turn into? You can do the math as well as we can. But we think there's great potential here. When you look at other people, we don't think they figured out how to turn lead into gold. They're just really good at what they do. We think we can be every bit, as good in the Allstate brand and growing that business. Particularly now that we've gotten direct, what I would say is improved and unleashed that. And you can see that from Mario's charts on how much new business we're writing there. So we think there's lots of potential, like we're very optimistic, but we don't have -- here's our magic number that we're going to get to. But whatever the number is, it would lead a higher valuation of earnings than we currently have. If you're relating to the DOJ lawsuit, I don't think that will impact what eventually happens. But let me just reiterate, we're really confident in where we are with that claim, we put it that way. No. Let me give you a little -- I'll give you the summary and then go through Mario you can jump in here front. I don't know how you determine what's sustainable or not sustainable in frequency. Examples, if it -- in the winter, if it snows at 3 p.m., and it's kind of wet and then the temperature drops quickly and it turns the ice by time you get to 5:30 rush hour, a bunch of cars getting accidents. If it snows at 2 a.m., it doesn't matter so much. So I'm not really sure how you -- and that's just one example of the myriad of things that Mario talked about how far are you driving? How often do you drive? How fast you drive? What city driving? Who else drives? Like I don't know how you -- I don't know if they -- I don't know who it was on that remember said that, but I'm not sure how we would be able to with our math and the precision that we were being able to determine what's sustainable or unsustainable. What I would come back to is what Mario said, we price on what it is. So what it is, is what we factor in. Just the frequency goes down in a quarter, we don't suddenly decrease rates. Just like if it goes up in a quarter, we don't suddenly increase rates. We price to get a mid-90s combined ratio in auto insurance, and that's what we'll keep doing. I'll let Mario answer the percentage question. I would say in hold back -- I was trying -- think of it as a lever that dialed you turned. Some states were wide open and testing really high levels. Other states were at what we think is appropriate there. So we're constantly managing and testing learning in a live market on how much we bid on stuff. I mean there's just -- it's very sophisticated. So it's not like there's a go or no go level. But there is, to your point, important from a macro standpoint, like how many states you're making money. I would just add a couple of things. First, I don't think we'll ever be at 100%. But I also that that the high-growth competitors that your competitor, I guess, you're comparing us to, it probably has the same situation. Like not everything goes well in every state in this business. So I can see what people are trying to do. You're trying to triangulate between the gap of a small decrease in auto insurance to what's the increase is going to be and how does that translate into the increase in valuation multiple. Appropriate thing, we're focused on it as well. I would just say that the gap between the current growth and what potential is probably narrower than the gap that between the valuation, like our valuation multiple could be substantially higher even with small moves in the growth rate. You have to decide what you think that's worth and whether you want to pay for it or not. But I think that focusing -- it's not going to be a one-to-one thing, and it's not all going to happen at the same time. But we're confident we can grow like we know how to run this business. Why don't we go to the next question? First, I would say we want all customers all locations or most locations, but all risk levels. Mario, do you want to talk about maybe specialist, not general or non-standard. Okay. Thank you all for spending your time with us as we move forward, we'll keep doing what do well, which is to serve our customers. We're going work on accelerating our growth in the profit liability business, making sure we're proactively investing and we didn't have spent a lot of time on that today, but we've had really great results in our investment portfolio. And then expanding protection offerings through great platforms like Protection Plans. Thank you all. We'll see you next quarter."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. I'll start by covering Slide 4. On the top left of the table, you can see Property-Liability earned premiums of $13.3 billion increased 11.9% in the second quarter, driven by higher average premiums. The underwriting loss of $145 million improved by $1.9 billion compared to the prior year quarter due to improved underlying margins and lower catastrophes. The expense ratio of 21.3 was 0.8 points higher than prior year due to increased advertising as we continue to accelerate growth investments in rate adequate states and risk segments. The adjusted expense ratio, which excludes advertising costs and other non-core expenses was down 1.6 points in the quarter. The chart on the right depicts components of the 101.1 combined ratio. Catastrophe losses of $2.1 billion were 6.7 points favorable to the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 85.3 improved by 7.6 points compared to the prior year quarter with the improvement driven by higher average earned premium and moderating loss cost trends. Prior year reserve re-estimates, excluding catastrophes, had only a minor impact on current quarter results as favorable development in personal auto and homeowners insurance offset increases in personal umbrella liabilities and commercial auto reserves related to the transportation network contracts we began exiting in late 2022. Turning to Slide 5. You can see that we continue to successfully execute our profit improvement plan. The second quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 95.9 improved by 12.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The bars in the chart show consistent improvement in the quarter underlying combined ratio. I will note that we have adjusted 2022 and 2023 reported quarterly figures to reflect the updated average severity estimates as of the end of each of those years to remove the volatility related to intra-year severity adjustments. You can see that the auto business has seen six sequential quarters of underlying combined ratio improvement with an underlying combined ratio of 93.5 in the second quarter of 2024. The dark blue line in the chart shows how rate increases throughout 2022 and 2023 pushed average premiums above underlying losses and expenses represented by the light blue line starting in the second half of 2023. As average premium increases have outpaced loss and expense profitability has improved. Relative to the prior year quarter, average underlying loss and expense was 5.5% higher, as you can see in the second row of the table. This reflects higher current year incurred severity estimates primarily driven by bodily injury coverage, offset by lower accident frequency as well as higher advertising investments. Physical damage severity increases continue to moderate, while bodily injury continues to trend above inflation. Our claims team is focused on operational actions to mitigate the impact of inflationary trends, including identifying injuries earlier in the claims process to improve overall cycle time and focus on fast and fair resolution. Let's review Homeowners insurance on Slide 6 which had improved underlying performance. Allstate is an industry leader in Homeowners insurance, generating low 90s combined ratios over the last 10 years, as you can see in the chart on the right. This performance compares favorably to the industry, which experienced an underwriting loss and a 103 combined ratio over that same time period. Moving to the table on the left. Allstate Protection homeowners written premium increased by 13.7% compared to prior year, reflecting both higher average gross written premium per policy and policy in force growth of 2.2%. The second quarter combined ratio of 111.5% resulted in $375 million of underwriting losses compared to the $1.3 billion loss in the prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 63.5 improved by 4.1 points due to higher average premium and lower non-catastrophe claim frequency, which more than offset modest increases in non-catastrophe severity. For the first six months of 2024, Homeowners insurance generated an underwriting profit of $189 million. Moving to Slide 7. Let's discuss Transformative Growth our multiyear strategy to create a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. The 5 components of Transformative Growth are shown in the blue panels on the left side of the page, and we continue to make good progress on all of them. On the right-hand side, we show the tangible outcomes and proof points that we're delivering through this transformation, which improve the customer experience and support our objective to profitably grow market share over time. Two examples of those tangible outcomes that I'd highlight are the new affordable, simple and connected auto insurance product that was built on our new technology platform is now available in 19 states. And that in the second quarter, we increased our advertising investment by approximately $300 million to support growth efforts in states with attractive returns. Moving to Slide 8. We'll double-click on the multichannel distribution strategy, which enables us to serve customers based on their personal preferences. Our exclusive agents are available for local customers seeking personalized advice to fulfill broad insurance needs. Agency productivity has increased and bundling rates at point of sale are at all-time highs. Enhancements to direct capabilities and increased advertising attract more self-directed customers with new business production in the direct channel in the second quarter, nearly double that of the prior year. The National General acquisition significantly expanded the independent agent channel. If you look at the distribution of new business we write, shown in the pie charts on the bottom of slide, you can see the power of expanded customer access. The combination of broader distribution capabilities, increased advertising greater pricing sophistication and product expansion has resulted in a 90% increase in new business applications since 2020 with a much more balanced split across distribution channels. Now let's turn to Slide 9 to delve deeper into how the National General acquisition has allowed us to better serve customers who prefer to engage with independent agents. The $4 billion acquisition included a number of businesses, including personal auto insurance, group health, individual accident and health, and digital marketing platforms. Prior to the acquisition, we offered insurance in the independent agent channel through both the Allstate and Encompass brands, with the Encompass brand solely dedicated to selling through IAs. With the acquisition of National General, we now go to market in the independent agency channel, primarily through the National General brand. Through the ownership of National General since January of 2021, we have significantly increased the number of customers we protect through independent agents, having added almost 1.7 million policies in force reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 8% in policies over the past four years and bringing premiums written to over $5.1 billion for the first six months of this year. Underwriting margins remain attractive and National General is now one of the largest independent agent personal lines insurers with expansion into lower risk customer segments supporting additional growth going forward in the IA channel. Slide 10 reviews property liability policies in force for all brands. Given the successful execution of the Auto Insurance profit improvement plan, investments in growth will made in Allstate that offer attractive return opportunities. These higher growth investments led to a 17% increase in Personal Auto new business applications in the second quarter, as you can see at the top of the chart on the left. The green bars show the components of that growth in new policy sales. The first two bars reflect the drivers of the 23% increase in new business volume in the Allstate brand. Higher productivity per exclusive agents drove a 9% new business increase compared to prior year and advertising investments and enhancements to direct operations resulted in a 92% increase in the direct channel compared to the prior year. The last two green bars reflect national general growth in both the non-standard auto business and higher sales volume from the Custom360 middle market offering that we continue to roll out. On the right, you can see that total protection auto policies enforced decreased by 1.6% compared to prior year as the Allstate brand decrease was partially offset by growth at National General. Allstate brand auto policies in force decreased by 4.5% compared to prior year as policies lost from customer defections more than offset the increase in new policy sales. Allstate brand auto retention of 85.7 did improve by 0.2 points compared to prior year as the negative impact of large rate increases in 2022 and 2023 continues to moderate. National General growth of 548,000 policies in force offset almost 60% of the Allstate brand decrease. While margin improvement actions have negatively impacted policy growth, the were necessary to mitigate loss cost trends during a period of rapid loss cost inflation. And now I'll turn it over to Jess. Sure. Thanks for the question, Greg. So maybe the place I'd start like Tom said, retention is obviously critically important to growth, and we're pleased with the fact that retention is stabilizing. But we also recognize there's a handful of states that we have taken some pretty significant rate increases more recently, California, New York, New Jersey. Those are going to continue to have an impact on retention going forward. But absent those three states, we kind of like the trends that are emerging. But I want to talk a little bit about new business production and get at your question. So Greg, where I would start would be kind of how did we get here? And the reality is, as we've been implementing the auto profit improvement plan over the past couple of years, that's obviously being executed on a state-by-state, market-by-market basis. But as states have gotten to a rate adequate level, we've begun to lean in and invest more in growth to drive production in those states. And that would include things like unwinding underwriting guidelines to restrict business, increasing advertising spend, both nationally and locally. And as where we sit right now, as I'd say, about two-thirds of our states, the premium volume represented like two-thirds of our states, are what we would consider at profit target levels. And then there's about another 10% or so that are kind of on the path to getting there. So overall, we feel really good about the vast majority of country in terms of geographically where we're comfortable investing. And you see the momentum that's really been building over the course of the year. Last quarter, production was up about 9% in total. This quarter, it was up 17% as we further ramped up growth investments. And we're going to continue to do that. At the same time, you've seen us take less rate, which, as Tom mentioned, helps retention. But we're going to continue to be diligent about staying on top of loss cost trends really broadly across states. And as I mentioned, there are some states that aren't in that growth category right now that we've got to get to target levels of profitability. We're going to continue to focus on taking rates that are necessary there. And when we're successful, those will become additive to the parts of the country where we can invest. So that kind of got us to where we're at in terms of geography and new business and the good news is we're seeing the growth across brands and across channels. Yes. And Jimmy, thanks for the question. I'll answer the question broadly, but I'd put a caveat around it that, obviously, what I'm going to say is going to vary by company and it's going to vary geographically because the business has just operated that way, and there's a lot of competitors in the market. But I would say, by and large, as we discussed this morning and as many of our competitors have reported profitability in auto is improving as loss cost trends have improved. And all of the things being equal, when that happens and margins are better. There's just less rate activity in the system, and that's what we're saying -- companies generally taking less rate than they were over the last couple of years. Again, that will vary by company. Some started later than others and are still catching up. Others are a little further along. But generally, we see less rate getting pushed through. And then certainly, that varies geographically as well. Having said that, I would just take that along with what Tom talked about in terms of advertising and say that when you take the totality of where we're positioned and what we're building with transformative Growth, we like where we're positioned in our ability to be able to increase growth investments and be successful in a competitive marketplace. That's what we're building, and we like our chances. Sure. Thanks, Jack. I guess the place I'd start is as much as we dig into the components of profitability. They're all important, but we should lose sight of the fact that the way we manage the auto business is to generate mid-90s combined ratios across the entirety of the system. And we use levers like rates and we look at pure premium, whether that's frequency and severity and expenses, they all matter. And certainly, the loss trend helps inform what we need to do with some of the other levers. What I would say, as I mentioned, the negative trend, the negative 0.8% that you see in the supplement as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's a little bit of noise in in there terms of year-over-year comparisons because we were moving severity targets around intra-quarter last year. So the adjusted numbers, it's slightly positive, it's about 1%. So not all that different. But I would say it's -- favorable frequency has continued through the first half of the year has been offset by higher severity predominantly in bodily injury, which continues to run above inflation and on the physical damage side, we continue see some good tailwinds with things like used car prices and stabilizing repair costs and so on. But that's kind of the overall loss trend that we're reacting to. In terms of the sustainability of frequency, it's a really difficult question to answer. Things like weather and geography risk segments all come into play. Frequency has been better than it was a year ago. When we look at our telematics data, which gives us a lot of rich information, miles driven per operators up a little bit but trips are shorter. So that could be having an impact on frequency. Weather favorably impacted frequency in the first quarter. And the other thing I'd say is as we've been looking to improve profitability over the last couple of years and not growing, the risk segmentation and the mix of our auto book has shifted around a bit to higher lifetime value, let lower frequency type business, that's having an impact as well. So there's a lot of moving parts in there. One thing I will say is as we go forward and write more new business, that will impact prospective frequency trends, but I'll go back to where I started. We manage the system in its entirety to generate mid-90s combined ratio profitability, and we're going to continue to do that despite however frequency bounces around. Yes. And David, what I'd say -- I'd go back to what I said earlier, as we look at that kind of same mix of states, about two-thirds in terms of premium volume of states are at or below our target combined ratio. And I'd say about another 10% or so are on the path to getting there with rate that we've already approved. I guess there's a handful of states that that we're not leaning in, and that's true beyond just the advertising spend, but it would be around things like underwriting guidelines and so on. As much as we've talked about California, New York, New Jersey. California, we got approval for a 30% rate. We are writing new business across all channels in California. As a matter of fact, we filed an additional 6.9% rate to stay ahead of the loss trend because you don't want to get behind in California. But we are now writing in California, and we're spending some marketing dollars there. The two that on the other side of the country, New York and New Jersey are ones that we're still effectively managing what we write. And we're writing very low volumes of business. Having said that, we've gotten rate approvals in New York. We're in active conversations with the department on a 24% rate that we filed that we hope to get resolution on hopefully reasonably soon. And then we'll revisit that stance. And in New Jersey, we got rate approved at the end of last year. We just implemented another low teens rate in July, and we've got another one coming in December. And as we evaluate where that positions us we'll reassess our risk appetite and how much we want to invest. And I'll go back to saying what I've said multiple times is our objective function is to be able to write in every state. But the reality is we need to see a path to attractive returns and profitability to be able to do that once we get there, then we'll expand our appetite across geographies. Yes, Charlie, I'd say from a channel perspective, like in the Allstate brand, we have differentiated pricing between agency and direct. So we have we have the ability to do that to match the cost of doing business in the channel with the price that we charge. In terms of underwriting risk appetite, we write in standard and preferred across the entirety of the risk segment. And if we have the right price in the agent channel, we're right in the agent channel, and we'll also write it indirect. So there's very few exceptions in terms of different underwriting standards across channels. In terms of brands, the one risk segment that I think is new in the sense of we acquired it when we acquired National General is the nonstandard auto business, which historically Allstate really didn't participate in, in a meaningful way. That's a very well-run business. That's the lion's share currently of the nonstandard auto premium, generating really strong growth unit growth just under 12% with really strong profitability. And the one thing I'd say on that segment of business, there tend to be a lot of shoppers in that segment. So you can turn growth on and off a lot more rapidly. You tend to be able to reprice the book pretty quickly because the retention is lower. And I think that's become a real growth lever for us. As you can see in our numbers, we've been able to grow that business grow it profitably because we now have the right capabilities to write in that segment, which we didn't have when we started transformative growth. So but we're -- as Tom mentioned, we're positioned to write across channels, across brand and equally importantly, risk segments through National General in nonstandard Auto. But now, as I've talked about, Custom360 and rolling out middle market standard preferred and homeowner product, we can go upmarket in the independent agent channel as well. But we're positioned to write across the entirety of system."

Yesterday, following the close of market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation, along with our reinsurance update on to our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and our strategy. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.\n As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2023 and other public documents for information on potential risks.\n Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would also like to provide an update on our monthly financial disclosures since early 2022, and implemented rate actions from the prior month have been included in our monthly release and disclosed on our Investor Relations website to provide additional transparency on our proactive response to the rapid rise in loss costs. Going forward, our implemented rate disclosures for auto and homeowners insurance will be disclosed on a quarterly basis instead of monthly within our investor supplement.\n And now I'll turn the call over to Tom. \nThomas Wilson: Good morning. Thank you for investing your time and have interest in explaining why Allstate's such an attractive [indiscernible]. And then Mario and Jesse are going to walk through the operating performance. And then as Brent mentioned, as there we'll have time for Q&A.\n Let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate strategy has 2 components, which is shown on the left there, increased personal property-liability market share and expand protection provided to customers. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the quarter. So we generated net income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter. The profit improvement was broad-based. It reflects successful execution of the auto insurance profit improvement plan, attractive homeowners' insurance margins, and they also benefited from lower catastrophe losses in this quarter.\n Net investment income was up almost 33%, reflecting the 2022 and 2023 repositioning into longer duration, higher fixed income yields and then yields also went up some. And We had good performance-based valuations this quarter as well. Protection Services also had a good quarter, and that was led by Protection Plans and Roadside Services; if you go; down to the bottom, what do we do from here, we have a broad approach to further increase shareholder value.\n First improving auto profitability in underperforming states will increase returns. Secondly, we're focused on increasing policies in force under the Allstate brand while continuing to expand National General. Mario is going to talk about that in a few minutes. Allstate's integrated approach to investing has and will continue to create value for shareholders. Expanding protection services will benefit both our customers and shareholders. And then the sale of the Health and Benefits business to a buyer that can further leverage our success will create more shareholder value. Although I'd point out, it will have a short-term negative impact on return on equity.\n Let's review the broad-based profit improvement on Slide 3. So revenues were $15.3 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 10.9% increase in Property-Liability earned premium and that, of course, was primarily due to kick rate increases in both auto and homeowners insurance. Over the last 12 months, property-liability written premiums have increased by almost $5 billion on an annual basis. Net investment income in the quarter was $764 million, or $32.9 for the prior year, and that reflects those higher fixed income yields and the duration extension I just mentioned. The strong profitability in the quarter generated adjusted net income of $1.4 billion or $5.13 per diluted share.\n Now let me turn it over to Mario to go through property liability results. \nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Tom. Let's start on Slide 4. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10.9% in the first quarter, driven by higher average premiums. Underwriting income was $89 million, the combined ratio of 93%, which improved by 15.6 points compared to prior year was driven by higher premiums earned, improved underlying loss cost trends, lower catastrophe losses and operating efficiencies. The chart on the right depicts the components of the 93 combined ratio. Lower catastrophe losses of $731 million were 8.8 points favorable to the prior year quarter, reflecting milder winter weather.\n The underlying combined ratio of 86.9% improved by 6.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by higher average premium and moderating loss cost increases. Expense reduction programs also benefited results more than offsetting higher advertising spend. Prior year reserve reestimates, excluding catastrophes, had only a small impact on results. Favorable development in personal auto and homeowners insurance largely offset increases in personal umbrella liabilities and commercial auto reserves for the transportation network contracts we began exiting in late 2022.\n Now let's take a closer look at auto insurance profitability on Slide 5. The first quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 96 improved by 8.4 points compared to the prior year quarter, showing that our profit improvement plan is working. The left chart shows quarterly underlying combined ratios. You will remember, we showed this chart last year, which adjusts 2022 and 2023 quarterly reported figures to reflect the updated average severity estimates as of the end of each respective year. As you can see, the underlying combined ratio improved sequentially in each of the last 5 quarters to 95.1% in the first quarter of 2024.\n The chart on the right shows that in the first half of 2023, premium increases in dark blue were being offset by higher underlying losses and expenses. Profits began to improve in the third quarter of 2023 as premiums outpaced loss and expense increases and this continued in this year's first quarter. The slight first quarter drop in underlying loss and expense reflects lower claim frequency that benefited from milder weather and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher severity.\n Relative to the prior year quarter, average underlying loss and expense in the first quarter of 2024 was 6.7% higher as you can see at the top of the table. This reflects higher current year incurred severity estimates, primarily driven by bodily injury coverage, which was partially offset by lower accident frequency and the favorable impact on current year severity of favorable prior year reserve development in the Allstate brand.\n Given the impact that good weather had on frequency in the quarter, favorable frequency may not persist as the year progresses. While auto margins have improved due to our price improvement actions we remain focused on ensuring that rate levels continue to keep pace with underlying cost trends driving improved profitability in those states not yet achieving target margins.\n Slide 6 shows how auto profit improvement supports pursuing policy growth. As shown on the left, Allstate brand implemented rate increases exceeding 16% in both 2022 and 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we implemented rate increases of 2.4% to keep up with the cost trends and improve margins in states not achieving target margins. The chart on the right depicts the Allstate brand auto proportion of premium in states with an underlying combined ratio of below 96%, shown by the dark blue bars. As more states have achieved target returns, we have started to increase marketing investment, both nationally and in those states. Slide 7 shows that while Allstate brand policies in force decreased compared to prior year, albeit at a slower rate than last quarter, over half that decline was offset by growth at National General.\n On the left, you can see that total protection auto policies in force decreased by 2% and compared to prior year due to a decline of 5.2% in the Allstate brand, reflecting the continued impact of auto insurance profit improvement actions. Underneath this decline is the positive impact of higher Allstate agent productivity and direct channel sales. Customer retention in the Allstate brand also continued to improve, and that improvement has a significant impact on growth trends. Allstate brand auto retention of 86% improved by 0.3 points compared to prior year, as the negative impact of large rate increases in 2022 and 2023 begins to moderate.\n As we discussed last quarter, we received approval for rate increases in the profit challenge states of California, New York and New Jersey, which were affected this quarter. Renewal trends in those states were stable in the first quarter, but the full impact on customer retention had not yet impacted growth. Allstate brand new business also increased 7% versus the prior year, reflecting more advertising and increased Allstate agent productivity and direct sales.\n National General was another positive to growth. Policies in force increased by 12.6% over the prior year due to an increase in nonstandard auto insurance and the continued rollout of a new middle market standard and preferred auto insurance product, also known as Custom360.\n Slide 8 summarizes homeowners insurance profitability, which generated strong returns in the quarter. Homeowners insurance provides a differentiated customer experience and represents an additional growth opportunity across channels. The chart shows the homeowners combined ratio over time, achieving a 10-year average of approximately 92. The first quarter combined ratio of 82.1 translated to $564 million of underwriting income and improved 36.9 points compared to prior year, primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 65.5 also improved by 2.1 points due to higher average premium and lower noncatastrophe claim frequency.\n Allstate Protection homeowners generated double-digit written premium growth compared to prior year, reflecting higher average gross written premium per policy and policies in force growth of 1.4%. Allstate agents continue to bundle auto and homeowners insurance at historically high levels. And National General's Custom360 product offers additional growth opportunities in the independent agent channel. Allstate has created an industry-leading business model, and we remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss the property liability growth opportunities. Starting on the first row. Improving customer retention remains key to improving our growth trajectory. Auto retention levels have stabilized and sequentially improved over the last two quarters and homeowners retention improved 0.8 points to the prior year quarter. Our agents and employees continue to guide customers through the renewal process by offering coverage options and ways to save through innovative programs and discounts like Drivewise and Milewise telematics offerings.\n Growth can also be increased by easing new business restrictions. As rate adequacy has been achieved in more states, restrictive underwriting policies have been unwound in states representing more than 75% of Allstate brand auto premium. Increased Allstate brand advertising is also expected to increase growth. The components of transformative growth are being implemented to create sustainable growth. An improved competitive position will result from further expense reductions.\n Expanded customer access comes from increased Allstate agent productivity, enhanced direct distribution and the expansion of Custom360 to more independent agents. A new Allstate brand, affordable, simple and connected auto insurance product is available in 9 states on the direct sales side. Online quote completion time has been reduced by 40% to less than 3 minutes within the new technology ecosystem. This platform will be expanded to the Allstate agent channel this year into more states and homeowners over the next several years. With these growth levers, Allstate is positioned to generate sustainable, profitable growth.\n Now I'll turn it over to Jesse to talk about other operating results. \nJesse Merten: Thank you, Mario. I'm moving to Slide 10, let's discuss the increase in investment income. Before we dig into specifics, let me reiterate that our active portfolio management includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, interest rates and credit spreads by rating, sector and individual names. We seek to optimize return per unit of risk across the enterprise. This approach to portfolio management continued to benefit results in the quarter. Net investment income shown in the chart on the left totaled $764 million in the quarter, which is $189 million above the first quarter of last year.\n Market-based income of $626 million shown in blue was $119 million above the prior year quarter as the fixed income portfolio continues to benefit from repositioning into longer duration and higher yielding assets that have sustainably increased income. Performance-based income of $201 million shown in black was $75 million above the prior year quarter due to higher valuation increases and was above the trend that we have seen in recent quarters but lower than 2022.\n The performance-based portfolio is constructed to enhance long-term returns and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter as expected. Total portfolio return of 0.5% for the quarter and 4.8% for the last 12 months which is shown in the table below the left chart indicates that a balanced approach to risk and return creates shareholder value. The chart on the right shows changes made to the bond portfolio duration in comparison to interest rates over time. Higher income this quarter reflects increases in duration as inter rates rose in 2022 and 2023. The table below the chart shows fixed income portfolio earned yield was 4.1% at quarter end, but 0.7 point increase compared to 3.4% for the prior year quarter.\n Slide 11 breaks down the growth and profit performance of the Protection Service businesses. Revenues in these businesses increased 12.2% to $753 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This result is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans, which increased 20.5% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded product breadth and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $54 million in the first quarter increased $20 million compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to 2 businesses. Profitable growth in Allstate Protection plans resulted in adjusted net income of $40 million, representing an increase of $12 million compared to the prior year quarter, higher revenue and improved claims trends benefited the bottom line. Allstate Roadside had adjusted net income of $11 million, driven by increased pricing, improved provider capacity and lower costs.\n Shifting to Slide 12, the Health and Benefits business continued to perform well. For the first quarter of 2024, revenues of $635 million increased by $52 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by premium growth in individual and group health in addition to higher fees and other revenue in those businesses. Adjusted net income of $56 million in the first quarter was consistent with the prior year quarter as individual health fee income growth was offset by lower employer voluntary benefit income.\n On Slide 13, we'll wrap up our prepared remarks where we started by reiterating Allstate's strategy and opportunities to increase shareholder value; improving auto insurance profitability, pivoting to growing auto and homeowners' policies in force, proactive risk and return management of the investment portfolio, expanding Protection Services and completing the sale of Health and Benefits, which we expect to occur in 2024.\n With that context, let's open up the line for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. \nJamminder Bhullar: So my first question was just on your views on PIF growth. And I realize it's going to be challenging in the near term, just given price increases. But with the expense cuts and coming through and once you're done with repricing, do you think that it's reasonable to assume that you'll have positive growth beginning sometime later this year or early next year in the auto business? \nThomas Wilson: Jimmy, we do believe that it's time to pivot to growth that we has had restrict growth so we could get profitability up in the auto insurance business. We're not done with it yet, but we feel that the trajectory is good and we get a path forward on that. Mario went through the long list of various ways we can do it. First, of course, you just keep more of your existing customers. And then we have a bunch of other ways that we think we can grow new business.\n When that will actually turn by quarter will be dependent on what happens in the marketplace. But it is, we believe, the really great opportunity to increase shareholder value because when you look at our valuation relative to a higher growth company like Progressive, it's -- there's a substantial discount. And we believe that this pivot to growth will drive more shareholder value. Mario, anything you want to add to that? \nMario Rizzo: No, I think that covers it in. The only thing I'd say is in the Allstate brand, obviously, we continue to see the impacts of the profit improvement plan that we've implemented over the last couple of years. But we're starting to see, as Tom mentioned, some positive signs on retention as well as an uptick in production. And first, we need to see sequential growth before we'll get to annual year-over-year growth. And I think it's important to point out in National General. We continue to see really strong growth in that business, along with really strong profitability that we're encouraged by. And we think there's -- most of that growth in National General is coming in the nonstandard auto insurance business, we think there's an additive opportunity that we're going to continue to go after, as I mentioned, with Custom360. So opportunity across all brands and all channels going forward. \nJamminder Bhullar: And can you talk about progress on the benefit sale? Obviously, from the outside, we haven't seen any movement. But -- and then just how you think about the deployment of the proceeds that come out of that sale? \nJesse Merten: Jimmy, this is Jesse. So as it relates to the process, I would say things are progressing as expected on the pursuit of the divestiture. You'll remember we announced the intention to pursue the sale about 6 months ago, almost to the day. And as you might expect, there was robust interest from a large group of quality potential buyers on both strategic and financial. So diligence on a large complex business takes some time in so to selecting the right potential buyers to stay involved in the process. At this point, we're pleased with how the process is progressing, and we're confident that we'll be in a position to select a buyer that sees the same potential in the business that we do and is aligned with our strategic rationale for the sale. So we continue to pursue the divestiture as we said. And obviously, we'll let you all know as soon as we have a definitive agreement in place and offer more details at that time. \nThomas Wilson: Jim, let me make a comment about the capital since it came up -- you mentioned that it came up at a number of the analyst write-ups last night. So first, we're very well capitalized. We've made that point consistently over the last couple of years. Obviously, the divestiture of health and benefits would free up additional capital. We're doing it because we believe it's the right way to harvest value, as Jesse pointed out. We think this is a great business that's shown up in the people who have been interested in buying it, but we also think that somebody else could do more with it than we can do with.it.\n When you look at capital utilization, I would say that it's embedded in kind of a like from our strategy to enterprise risk and return to reinsurance to how we price homeowners insurance in a local market. And a couple of things I would say all those decisions are made with math, highly sophisticated math. So sometimes I think that confuses some people when we have more sophisticated math than things like premium surplus ratios.\n But when we do that, we're looking at what the impact is economically and what the impact is on shareholder value. And we look at a really wide range of alternatives. First -- the first best opportunities of organic growth, given the high returns in our auto home protection plan businesses, we get really good returns there. And as I mentioned, we think that will drive increased valuation in the stock without earnings. After that, you said, well, share repurchase, a number of people asked about share repurchases. It's another thing that we look at. \n We've -- as you know, we bought back a lot of stock since we went public we've bought back almost $42 billion worth of stock, which is 83% of shares outstanding. If you look over the last 10 years, it's about half the shares and about $20 billion, you look over 5 years, that's 1/4 of the shares and about $10 billion. So we have no aversion to that. When you say, well, what kind of return do you get on that? Of course, it depends on what price you bought it at and what day you're marking it to market.\n It is low point, it tends to look like cost of capital. Today, it looks like it's in the 10% to 14% range, depending on what period of time we look at. So that's a good return, one that we think benefits shareholders. On the other hand, it's not as good as at which we get from deploying it in those businesses. So deploying getting growth is why we believe that we have a whole bunch of other things we look at. We could increase the equity allocation and investment portfolio.\n As we've told you, we're -- we have a bimodal approach there. About 60% is illiquid. We hang on to over ups and downs and 40%, it's liquid, we're down at the lowest level we've ever been in liquid equity securities. And we did it because we didn't like the risk in return. We're not trying to be a hedge fund, but we thought we had better places to put the money. We could decide we want to dial up there. Sometimes we put opportunity money in new capabilities, Arity.\n If you look at Arity, we've now got 1.5 trillion miles of driving data. We're getting over $1 billion a week. We're expanding that from just pricing people who are our customers to pricing people before they become customers, which makes you be more efficient in marketing and advertising. Sometimes we acquire companies. So if you look at our protection plans business, it's like 10x its size and we bought it for $1.4 billion. We look at National General, we paid $4.1 billion, I think just -- and that's like double its size.\n So we did -- haven't done as well harvesting the value out of our identity protection business yet, but we're confident we got the right pick there that people are at greater risk, recently figure out how to grow it faster and make more money. So we have a whole bunch of opportunities that we look at. So I don't think you should just automatically default to something that falls into an easy analysis if you got the extra money to do share repurchases. No, we'll think about it hard. We'll do the right thing for shareholders, and then we'll make sure we're communicating with people. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. \nAndrew Kligerman: Yes, it seems like your PIF growth is right around the corner of pivoting down only 1.4% year-over-year. So I'm wondering on the Allstate brand your expense ratio on advertising was 2.2%. Historically, if I look back at 2017 to '19, it was roughly 2.5%. So is there First question, is there much to go in terms of your ad campaigns? Or do you feel like you're kind of at a level where you need to be? \nThomas Wilson: I'll let Mario talk about how he's reorganizing the business and really going to market in an integrated fashion to drive growth. As it relates to advertising, we don't like to give those numbers out just because we've got other people out there doing their advertising as well. What I will point out is one of the key components of transformative growth was improving our sophistication of customer acquisition. So no matter what percentage it is we want it to be more effective. But Mario, maybe you should talk about how you're changing your go-to-market. \nMario Rizzo: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. I guess where I start. First, the good news, as we pointed out, in the presentation as more and more states are achieving rate adequacy. And right now, in about 75% of the states we operate in, we've began to unwind underwriting restrictions. And to your point, begin investing in marketing to look to grow.\n The other thing we've done in anticipation of that opportunity, not only being there, but continuing to expand, is we're organizing ourselves in what we call go-to-market teams that are local market focused that are really intended to drive kind of bottoms-up opportunity, identification and capture again, at the local market level so that we can get the highest possible return on things like the marketing investments we're making, the continued expansion, up distribution as well as the growth opportunity that exists across channels in those states.\n So we're early days in that, but we are putting behind our organization structure to be more focused on local market growth. And you remember, we manage this business state by state, market by market. So having local market insight, intelligence and the ability to move rapidly to capture opportunities is really going to be critical. And we think that alongside the expanded investment we're making in growth, will create significant growth opportunity for us going forward. \nThomas Wilson: And we know that it works because we've used it for a long time. So -- and we dismantled some of it about 2 or 3 years ago when we were cutting expenses that didn't want to grow. And now that we're back into growth mode, we're just expanding what we know works. \nAdam Klauber: That's very helpful. And then the second question with regard to National General, just trying to get my arms around, how much growth potential there? How much of the book right now is nonstandard versus the Custom360s. The Custom360 relatively very small. And are those the right agents to generate big time growth on the more traditional or more standard products? \nThomas Wilson: Well, we wouldn't give out that percentage in each, but you're correct. And then it's -- when we bought National General, it was mostly a nonstandard company. And we bought it for the strategic opportunity to leverage our capabilities in, which is called preferred auto and home insurance, and that's turning out to be true. Mario, maybe you want to talk about the success you're having with Custom360. \nMario Rizzo: Yes. So Andrew, I guess the place I'd start is, first of all, we're really happy with the acquisition of National General. As Tom mentioned, we've effectively doubled the size of our independent agent business since we bought it in early 2021. And there's really 3 pieces to the business. There's the nonstandard auto piece, which is the by far the biggest component. And then there's what we call the legacy household business, which is think about our Encompass business that we integrated into it along with the legacy National General Standard Auto, Preferred and home business. And then there's Custom360.\n And Custom360 is the new product offering. We're in about 17 states currently with the intent to expand pretty much into every state by the end of this year or into 2025. And we think that really represents an additive growth opportunity. The product offering itself is built on the Allstate product chassis. So think about the sophisticated rating plans that we have in standard and preferred auto in Allstate, the host and home product that we have in Allstate.\n So those are the products that we're launching in the independent agent channel. And really, to your point, there's a different distribution, a different segment of the independent agent distribution system that we're looking to engage with to really grow that product portfolio. We're early stages. As I said, we're in 17 states. We're really encouraged by the early growth that we're seeing in the states that we've rolled out and more importantly, the agency engagement we're seeing on the IA side. We're going to continue to look to expand on that and leverage that going forward, but we're really optimistic around Custom360 and the opportunity beyond nonstandard auto and the IA channel. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. \nCharles Peters: So for the first question, I'd like to just have you comment on both frequency and severity, frequency trends through the first quarter and sort of how you're thinking about severity for 2024, both inside the Allstate brand and also at NatGen. \nMario Rizzo: Thanks, Greg. This is Mario. I'm going to make some comments off the slide -- off of Slide 5 that we showed you in the presentation, which really shows the -- starts with the average underlying loss and expense trend that we saw in the quarter. That number is about 6.7%. If you take out the expense component, it drops by over 1 point. So I'd say the loss trend we're seeing in the protection business in the mid-5s, and that's made up of both frequency and severity. As we indicated, frequency relative to last year, just given the milder weather was favorable. And then the other component of it is severity. So it's, I'd say, favorable frequency more than offset by higher severity. But severity is continuing to moderate in terms of the rate of increase that we're seeing.\n Maybe a little bit of color underneath severity broadly because really, there's 2 different emerging stories both in physical damage and in injury. And physical damage, we continue to see the benefit of things like lower used car prices. Total loss severity continues to drop. But it continues to cost more to fixed cars, and that's made up of continually increasing parts prices and labor costs. So we've seen increasing severity and physical damage repairable -- for repairable vehicles, but not at the same rate we have been seeing before. That has moderated.\n The real ongoing severity pressure is in beyond the injury side, which continues to run at higher than historical levels. That's driven by a lot of the things we've been talking about, medical treatments, medical consumption, inflation. It's also being driven by the fact that more of our customers continue to get sued and attorney representation levels continue to increase and that's putting pressure on severity. It's also resulting in higher cost for consumers ultimately. The cost to settle injury claims going up at the level that it is translating into higher insurance prices for consumers.\n I'd point out a state like Florida, where last year, they passed meaningful tort reform, and we're starting to see some positive impacts of that tort reform, which I think will bode well for consumers going forward.\n Georgia just -- the Georgia legislature just passed some tort reform, which, again, can be a positive for consumers going forward. And obviously, we're a strong proponent of that kind of reform broadening across more states going forward. But Greg, to your question, positive frequency in the quarter, hard to quantify with any degree of precision what the weather was worth, but it was favorable, offset with severity levels that are running lower than they have been running, but still at positive levels, which is why we're going to stay on top of pricing to make sure that our rates fully reflect loss trends and keep pace with loss trends in the states that we've reopened for growth and continue to pursue rates in states where we haven't achieved target profitability yet. And that would be true both in the Allstate brand and National General. \nCharles Peters: I guess in conjunction with that answer, you brought up rate. And I know you mentioned that you're not going to provide us updates on pricing going forward because you're rate adequate. I know -- if you go back to previous presentations, you've called out 3 states. And even after you reported fourth quarter, you still were I think New Jersey and New York were kind of still in the question mark period. Has there been some updates there in those 2 states that you want to give us that leads you to believe that they are rate adequate now too as well? \nThomas Wilson: I'll let Mario go into the 3 states, but I just want to clarify. We decided not to give it to you every month because -- we don't -- we think you get to drill, you know what we're doing, and we don't need to do it. We didn't say we're very adequate so don't worry about it. We're always focused on it. We just didn't think we needed to like burden people sending out every month. \nMario Rizzo: Yes, Greg, it's Mario. I'll just give you a little more color on those 3 states. Remember, last quarter, we told you we had just got an approval in the fourth quarter for auto rate increases in all 3 of those states. In California -- and we implemented those rate increases this past quarter. In California, we feel comfortable of where the rate level is with the increase, and we've reopened California for new business. really no change in New York and New Jersey in terms of our underwriting risk appetite, even with the rate approvals that we got late last year.\n We still don't feel like we're at the appropriate rate level to want to grow in those two states. The only update I'd give you on one of the states is, New Jersey recently approved a 13.9% auto rate increase, which was one of the filings we had pending. That will be effective in the second half of this year. We're still going to need more rate beyond that before we would look to reopen that market. And in New York, we're having ongoing conversations around a pending rate that's with the department, but really nothing new to report at this point. And in those two states, in particular, we have not lifted any of the underwriting restrictions that we have in place. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Jian Huang from Morgan Stanley. \nJian Huang: Maybe just going back to the PIF growth and rates -- for Slide 6, if we look at the states that are above 96% combined ratio, I know that you talked about New York, New Jersey, California, but are there any other reasonably large states where you continue to need rates? And in those states, are you -- like comparing to your peers, is your loss ratio significantly above everyone else? Or in other words, if you were to raise rates in those states, do the customers have anywhere else to go? \nThomas Wilson: Well, that's a complicated question. Let's see if I can address it. So in all states, when you have severities going up the way Mario described it. You're going to be increasing rates at levels above what is the general inflation rate. So we expect to continue to have to do that. If our customers quick and sued every time they get an access, then maybe it will back off some. But -- so we're always moving rate up. You're really get into where is your competitive position.\n And I think it's difficult right now to determine where one's competitive position is in any individual state given how rapidly rates are moving and how they're moving through books of business, given how -- and so that said, we're confident that with transformative growth by reducing our expenses will end up in a lower cost, more competitive position than when we started this 4 years ago whatever place. It's just this blip in here where everyone is raising prices a lot, including us, as Mario pointed out, in auto alone, it was 16% in each of the last 2 years.\n Homeowners is not -- it's slightly lower, but also has the same trends to it. So -- we feel confident that the product offering we have, the technology we have, the agents we have, the broad set of distribution that will enable us to grow. Price is clearly an important part of that. And we're focused on making sure we're competitive, but we're not going to not take rate so that we can grow. One of our big competitors, State Farm's picked up almost a couple of points of market share over the last couple of years because they chose to run fairly large underwriting losses that won't be us. \nJian Huang: Okay. That's very helpful. But just curious, are there any other relatively large states outside of New York, New Jersey, California, where you still need rate at this point in time? \nMario Rizzo: No. Like if you go back to Page 6 that you mentioned that the top bar on the right, the 26%, the vast majority of that is those 3 states: California, New York and New Jersey. And then the -- both the light blue and the dark blue, when you kind of add those together, and we talked about unwinding underwriting restrictions in about 3/4 of the states. Again, we base those decisions on rate adequacy versus kind of a backward-looking combined ratio.\n And we feel good about where we're positioned the growth opportunity, and as we said a couple of times, we're going to stay on top of the loss trend in those states. But the states that are in that top section are the ones that we're going to continue to push incremental rate through because we're not at target margins yet. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the auto. I guess it's more on the underlying loss ratio. I thought in the past, right, the first quarter would seasonally be a better quarter for just an auto book in general, but understanding rate increases that can earn in can kind of mask that as we go through the year. And then I'm also not sure if there was maybe some favorable non-cat weather in the Q1 numbers. So just can you give us a sense of the cadence would you expect on the underlying loss ratio within auto to improve as we go through the year given the rate to earn in? Or is there some seasonality or other factors that we need to consider? \nThomas Wilson: Let me start, and Mario, you can jump in. First, you're correct in that first quarter is usually a better quarter in combined ratio in auto insurance than like the summer months when everybody is driving. To be able to do attribution of this current quarter versus other quarters and weather and how much -- what the sustainable [indiscernible] is really difficult to get it with any sort of precision. It's not that we don't try and we look at it when we come up with numbers, but they're not numbers that I would say would be for public consumption. \n What I would say is we feel really good about the trend in auto insurance profitability. As you point out, we got a lot more rates still coming through. We've gotten good control over our expenses. We're working hard on claims to try to deal with a high inflationary environment. Make, sure we keep costs down and not just accept that they have to go up at high single digits. So we feel really good about the trend, at least I don't know that I feel like one quarter makes a trend in that, I would say, this first quarter x percent was due to just some [indiscernible]. Mario, anything you would add to that? \nMario Rizzo: Yes. I think, Elyse, the components you mentioned are the right ones. And while I can't -- I'm not going to give you the guidance on continually improving loss ratio going forward. What we do know are a handful of things. Number one, we took over 16 points of rate last year and another 2.4 points in the first quarter. That's going to continue to earn through the book, and you're going to continue to see average earned premium growth going forward. That's just based on the actions we've taken so far.\n I talked a little bit about the loss trend earlier and where that was running -- we'll see how that plays out over the duration of the year. The only other piece I'd give you is the frequency component of that, there clearly is a weather benefit we got difficult to quantify. So the frequency benefit may or may not persist going forward. That would be the only thing in addition to just the Q1 seasonality that exists. But we feel good about where the earned premium trend is going and then we're obviously going to watch both components of the loss trend, and we're going to continue to push hard on expenses to drive cost out of the system, which will also help from a margin perspective. \nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, going back to earlier comments on the Health and Benefits transaction, is your plan still to expect to announce and close the transaction this year? And then I think based on your comments to a prior question, you implied right, that there was conversations with parties. It sounds like you're going down the route of one counterparty instead of perhaps maybe multiple. But can you just confirm, I guess, that that's the thought as well just to find one counterparty to buy the entirety of the business? \nJesse Merten: It's a normal process, Elyse. We're not going to go through [indiscernible] it. We still think we'll sell it this year. A lot of people are interested in the business, and we're confident we made the right choice. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. \nYaron Kinar: Most of my questions have been asked, but I did want to dig a little deeper into NatGen, if I could, in the PIF growth there. So I understand you have the Custom360 that should drive further growth. At the same time, we also see maybe some competitive pressures rising in nonstandard auto, which may actually result in a little bit of a decrease in that segment's growth? Maybe you can help us think through the two combined. \nThomas Wilson: I'll let Mario jump in, I know you're probably referring to Klauber's numbers. I'll let Mario jump in on state. But let me just mentioned something, I think kind of we talk about, but I'm not sure if it gets as much focus as I think it should, which is homeowners. The homeowners business is a really attractive business for us. We're really good at it. We have an integrated business model that you can see Mario showed the slide where we've earned a 92 combined ratio over a 10-year period. The industry dynamics today. A lot of that business is sold through independent agents, about half of it.\n And industry dynamics are right for us to leverage that position. There's a great interest in independent agents and having what they call markets or we would call availability. And when you look at why that is, this is -- the first customer risks are increasing, right, whether that's inflation in home values, whether it's demographic trends, people moving in the way of where there's severe weather or just increased severe weather. So there's increased need for risks. And then at the same time, the industry has lost money.\n So the industry lost money over the last 3 years, last 5 years, over the last 10 years, it made money but we made about 3/4 of that money. So the industry made about $10 billion over a 10-year period, and we made about 75% of that. So we're really good at it. And so we think that one of the ways to grow there is in the independent agent channel is by leveraging our homeowners. So we obviously can grow in homeowners in the Allstate agent channel. You see that our bundling stuff, whether you look at any of the industry reports, we're really good at bundling there.\n And you see the PIF growth there even when auto growth is going down, which wasn't always the case. They used to trend more together, but we've got so much better at bundling. So that's -- I don't want to leave homeowners on the cutting-room floor, as it relates to growth, both in the National General channel and the Allstate channel. Mario, do you want to talk about that. \nMario Rizzo: Yes. Thanks for the question, Yaron. Look, where I start is the National General nonstandard auto business is a really well-run business for us. And when we acquired NatGen several years ago, it allowed us to get into a business that Allstate was not in at that time in a particularly meaningful way. And we've been able to grow that pretty aggressively and grow it profitably. Over the last several years. Some of the ways we've been able to expand is we've expanded geographically, so we're in a lot more states with nonstandard auto now than when we bought the business. \n We've also expanded from a channel perspective, we allow Allstate agents to sell nonstandard auto through National General for business that's outside of Allstate's risk appetite. We sell it direct to consumer. So we've been able to expand the business, both geographically as well as across channels.\n And the business has been subject to the same inflationary pressures that the standard and preferred auto business has been subject to. But we've stayed on top of rate need. We've taken a lot of rate over the last couple of years, I believe, over 15 points in the last 12 months. So we've stayed on top of the rate need. It's a business that you can effectively reprice most of the book almost every policy period, just given the deflection rates. And we've been able to, over the last couple of years, take advantage of the competitive dislocation in nonstandard auto as a number of carriers have backed off from that business.\n We've taken advantage of that opportunity and taking advantage of by leveraging our capabilities in that space. And as much as the competition might be heating up there, we feel really good about our capabilities, and we're going to continue to look to grow that business as well as the standard preferred and homeowners that Tom talked about with Custom360. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. \nDavid Motemaden: I had a question just on the brand auto PIF. So the brand auto PIF was down about 1.5% compared to the fourth quarter. And I guess I'm wondering how. And now is for the entire book, the entire brand auto book. I guess I'm wondering how that PIF growth trended versus the fourth quarter in the 64% of the book that is at target margins that you showed on Slide 6, are you guys growing PIF in that part of the book? \nThomas Wilson: We wouldn't break those numbers out for competitive reasons. When it's big enough, so David, you could do math on it. So you could say, okay, here's when the churn is going to come. We would say it. But obviously, there are some markets, we're growing in other markets, we're not growing in. Some of those are markets. Some of those are states. When we get to the point where you can do the math to show when -- I know you -- I totally get where you're going because you want to figure out when the turn is. But we don't like to show what states were growing in at higher rates than others because then they get our competitors interested in going to those states. And we'd rather grow without having them be aware of where we're growing. \nDavid Motemaden: No, understood. It was worth a shot anyway. Just another question, just on the agent productivity. You gave some interesting stats last quarter that agent productivity was up 6% excluding California, New York, New Jersey. I'm just wondering how the productivity looked this quarter. Did that improve significantly? Or just how to think about that as a potential growth driver? \nThomas Wilson: Let me go up to transformative growth and get Mario to talk about the specifics of your question. So as part of transformative growth, we said we want to improve customer value. And that meant getting our agents to really focus on there were those things that customers really want them to do for them, which includes helping them buy insurance. It doesn't necessarily include having them there when they have to pay a bill for retention.\n They will pay for that, but they won't pay as much as they will for when they get to new business. So we shifted our compensation program to move to lower our cost for customers and better align it with what customers want to pay for. As a result of that, we both lowered distribution expense and we've had some agents who had the word -- had built business models on higher retention [indiscernible]. So our overall agent capacity in the Allstate brand has gone down. That said, to your point, productivity has gone up, and so our overall volume has been even better when you adjust for those 3 states that are not to be named. So Mario, do you want to go there? \nMario Rizzo: Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think the short answer to your question is yes. We -- when you look at overall Allstate brand new business production is up about 6.5%. It was up both in the Allstate exclusive agent channel as well as direct. And then if you kind of carve out California, New York and New Jersey. Because you have to remember, the California rate wasn't effective until February. So we really didn't start opening things back up until the really the latter part of the quarter.\n We're really pleased with how our agents are responding to the changes we've made that Tom talked about continue to invest in their businesses, continuing to drive higher levels of average productivity. And despite the fact that we have fewer agents and have restricted -- or have been restricting grown in 3 pretty significant states.\n Overall productivity is increasing and absolute production is up. So we're really happy with the productivity levels of our agents. And as we look to accelerate growth going forward, they're going to be a core part of how we grow prospectively in addition to things we've been talking about with independent agents and the direct channel. \nBrent Vandermause: We'll take one more question. \nOperator: Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. \nMichael Zaremski: I guess just I know there's been a lot of talk about growth. And the strategy has been clear you guys have successfully kind of transformed your expense ratio lower, which should help grow direct-to-consumer channel specifically. And I know Allstate has a ton of marketing expertise. But I'm just kind of curious, the direct-to-consumer -- customer, my understanding is a bit different than the average current Allstate customer. So is there -- are there any different strategies or maybe you kind of -- or just go slow to learn as you kind of grow into DC? Or anything you'd like to -- you think we should be thinking about there? \nThomas Wilson: Yes. The first -- the direct customer does have different needs. So they necessarily want to pay for someone to help them buy insurance, which is why we price our direct insurance under the Allstate brand, cheaper than Allstate-branded insurance bought through an agent. Because we're trying to do exactly what our customers want. They also have different ways they want to interact with us. And so we've -- with our new Transformer growth and new tech stack, it's really everything from what's prepopulated into the thing to the offers it presents to the questions you required to.\n As Mario talked about, we're down 40% in the time. We've been able to add other products to that flow and so increase things like roadside services and sell more products, which lowers our acquisition costs. So it is different. We're good at it, we could be better at it. And so we're working at getting better at it. About 2 years ago, we really reformed the business, put some new leadership in place and then are updating everything from the technology I talked about to also who you market to.\n So you mentioned they're direct, but some of the customers directly, that's where you go to. Like if you go to people who are shopping all time, then you will get higher risk drivers because they shop all the time as opposed to lower risk drivers don't shop as much. So it costs more to get the lower risk drivers on board. So we're working through how do we expand that. We believe that the direct channel has tremendous upside with us to serve those customers who want it that way not just on auto insurance, but things like home insurance and whether it's protection plans or what we're doing in. We get some stuff going on in the commercial space with direct.\n So we think it's just another way the customer would interact. Often -- not a lot of homeowners is sold over direct. We'll see how successful we are. I believe we can. I mean, people buy houses direct. So like if your buyouts or probably buy a home insurance from us. And so there's a great upside. You will notice that when you look over the last couple of years, One of the first places we dialed down new business was in the direct channel. So it was down like 50% or 60%, I think in '23 or something. \n Because we wanted to make sure we maintained our agent force levels of compensation because they have businesses right and this is the revenue that comes into their business. We said, okay, well, this is a temporary window it's easier for us to concentrate that reduction in new business in the direct channel than it is to spread it amongst a bunch of agents who are now also trying to get through a new comp plan. That turned out to be a good choice. It gave us the opportunity to build new capabilities. And now we're hitting the gas side expanding direct. So you should expect to see our direct volume is go up higher as a percentage of new business than it has better in the past. Thank you all for joining us and investing your time in Allstate. We'll talk to you next quarter. \nOperator: This concludes the investor call. You can now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Wilson",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for investing your time and have interest in explaining why Allstate's such an attractive [indiscernible]. And then Mario and Jesse are going to walk through the operating performance. And then as Brent mentioned, as there we'll have time for Q&A.\n Let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate strategy has 2 components, which is shown on the left there, increased personal property-liability market share and expand protection provided to customers. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the quarter. So we generated net income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter. The profit improvement was broad-based. It reflects successful execution of the auto insurance profit improvement plan, attractive homeowners' insurance margins, and they also benefited from lower catastrophe losses in this quarter.\n Net investment income was up almost 33%, reflecting the 2022 and 2023 repositioning into longer duration, higher fixed income yields and then yields also went up some. And We had good performance-based valuations this quarter as well. Protection Services also had a good quarter, and that was led by Protection Plans and Roadside Services; if you go; down to the bottom, what do we do from here, we have a broad approach to further increase shareholder value.\n First improving auto profitability in underperforming states will increase returns. Secondly, we're focused on increasing policies in force under the Allstate brand while continuing to expand National General. Mario is going to talk about that in a few minutes. Allstate's integrated approach to investing has and will continue to create value for shareholders. Expanding protection services will benefit both our customers and shareholders. And then the sale of the Health and Benefits business to a buyer that can further leverage our success will create more shareholder value. Although I'd point out, it will have a short-term negative impact on return on equity.\n Let's review the broad-based profit improvement on Slide 3. So revenues were $15.3 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 10.9% increase in Property-Liability earned premium and that, of course, was primarily due to kick rate increases in both auto and homeowners insurance. Over the last 12 months, property-liability written premiums have increased by almost $5 billion on an annual basis. Net investment income in the quarter was $764 million, or $32.9 for the prior year, and that reflects those higher fixed income yields and the duration extension I just mentioned. The strong profitability in the quarter generated adjusted net income of $1.4 billion or $5.13 per diluted share.\n Now let me turn it over to Mario to go through property liability results. Jimmy, we do believe that it's time to pivot to growth that we has had restrict growth so we could get profitability up in the auto insurance business. We're not done with it yet, but we feel that the trajectory is good and we get a path forward on that. Mario went through the long list of various ways we can do it. First, of course, you just keep more of your existing customers. And then we have a bunch of other ways that we think we can grow new business.\n When that will actually turn by quarter will be dependent on what happens in the marketplace. But it is, we believe, the really great opportunity to increase shareholder value because when you look at our valuation relative to a higher growth company like Progressive, it's -- there's a substantial discount. And we believe that this pivot to growth will drive more shareholder value. Mario, anything you want to add to that? Jim, let me make a comment about the capital since it came up -- you mentioned that it came up at a number of the analyst write-ups last night. So first, we're very well capitalized. We've made that point consistently over the last couple of years. Obviously, the divestiture of health and benefits would free up additional capital. We're doing it because we believe it's the right way to harvest value, as Jesse pointed out. We think this is a great business that's shown up in the people who have been interested in buying it, but we also think that somebody else could do more with it than we can do with.it.\n When you look at capital utilization, I would say that it's embedded in kind of a like from our strategy to enterprise risk and return to reinsurance to how we price homeowners insurance in a local market. And a couple of things I would say all those decisions are made with math, highly sophisticated math. So sometimes I think that confuses some people when we have more sophisticated math than things like premium surplus ratios.\n But when we do that, we're looking at what the impact is economically and what the impact is on shareholder value. And we look at a really wide range of alternatives. First -- the first best opportunities of organic growth, given the high returns in our auto home protection plan businesses, we get really good returns there. And as I mentioned, we think that will drive increased valuation in the stock without earnings. After that, you said, well, share repurchase, a number of people asked about share repurchases. It's another thing that we look at. \n We've -- as you know, we bought back a lot of stock since we went public we've bought back almost $42 billion worth of stock, which is 83% of shares outstanding. If you look over the last 10 years, it's about half the shares and about $20 billion, you look over 5 years, that's 1/4 of the shares and about $10 billion. So we have no aversion to that. When you say, well, what kind of return do you get on that? Of course, it depends on what price you bought it at and what day you're marking it to market.\n It is low point, it tends to look like cost of capital. Today, it looks like it's in the 10% to 14% range, depending on what period of time we look at. So that's a good return, one that we think benefits shareholders. On the other hand, it's not as good as at which we get from deploying it in those businesses. So deploying getting growth is why we believe that we have a whole bunch of other things we look at. We could increase the equity allocation and investment portfolio.\n As we've told you, we're -- we have a bimodal approach there. About 60% is illiquid. We hang on to over ups and downs and 40%, it's liquid, we're down at the lowest level we've ever been in liquid equity securities. And we did it because we didn't like the risk in return. We're not trying to be a hedge fund, but we thought we had better places to put the money. We could decide we want to dial up there. Sometimes we put opportunity money in new capabilities, Arity.\n If you look at Arity, we've now got 1.5 trillion miles of driving data. We're getting over $1 billion a week. We're expanding that from just pricing people who are our customers to pricing people before they become customers, which makes you be more efficient in marketing and advertising. Sometimes we acquire companies. So if you look at our protection plans business, it's like 10x its size and we bought it for $1.4 billion. We look at National General, we paid $4.1 billion, I think just -- and that's like double its size.\n So we did -- haven't done as well harvesting the value out of our identity protection business yet, but we're confident we got the right pick there that people are at greater risk, recently figure out how to grow it faster and make more money. So we have a whole bunch of opportunities that we look at. So I don't think you should just automatically default to something that falls into an easy analysis if you got the extra money to do share repurchases. No, we'll think about it hard. We'll do the right thing for shareholders, and then we'll make sure we're communicating with people. I'll let Mario talk about how he's reorganizing the business and really going to market in an integrated fashion to drive growth. As it relates to advertising, we don't like to give those numbers out just because we've got other people out there doing their advertising as well. What I will point out is one of the key components of transformative growth was improving our sophistication of customer acquisition. So no matter what percentage it is we want it to be more effective. But Mario, maybe you should talk about how you're changing your go-to-market. And we know that it works because we've used it for a long time. So -- and we dismantled some of it about 2 or 3 years ago when we were cutting expenses that didn't want to grow. And now that we're back into growth mode, we're just expanding what we know works. Well, we wouldn't give out that percentage in each, but you're correct. And then it's -- when we bought National General, it was mostly a nonstandard company. And we bought it for the strategic opportunity to leverage our capabilities in, which is called preferred auto and home insurance, and that's turning out to be true. Mario, maybe you want to talk about the success you're having with Custom360. I'll let Mario go into the 3 states, but I just want to clarify. We decided not to give it to you every month because -- we don't -- we think you get to drill, you know what we're doing, and we don't need to do it. We didn't say we're very adequate so don't worry about it. We're always focused on it. We just didn't think we needed to like burden people sending out every month. Well, that's a complicated question. Let's see if I can address it. So in all states, when you have severities going up the way Mario described it. You're going to be increasing rates at levels above what is the general inflation rate. So we expect to continue to have to do that. If our customers quick and sued every time they get an access, then maybe it will back off some. But -- so we're always moving rate up. You're really get into where is your competitive position.\n And I think it's difficult right now to determine where one's competitive position is in any individual state given how rapidly rates are moving and how they're moving through books of business, given how -- and so that said, we're confident that with transformative growth by reducing our expenses will end up in a lower cost, more competitive position than when we started this 4 years ago whatever place. It's just this blip in here where everyone is raising prices a lot, including us, as Mario pointed out, in auto alone, it was 16% in each of the last 2 years.\n Homeowners is not -- it's slightly lower, but also has the same trends to it. So -- we feel confident that the product offering we have, the technology we have, the agents we have, the broad set of distribution that will enable us to grow. Price is clearly an important part of that. And we're focused on making sure we're competitive, but we're not going to not take rate so that we can grow. One of our big competitors, State Farm's picked up almost a couple of points of market share over the last couple of years because they chose to run fairly large underwriting losses that won't be us. Let me start, and Mario, you can jump in. First, you're correct in that first quarter is usually a better quarter in combined ratio in auto insurance than like the summer months when everybody is driving. To be able to do attribution of this current quarter versus other quarters and weather and how much -- what the sustainable [indiscernible] is really difficult to get it with any sort of precision. It's not that we don't try and we look at it when we come up with numbers, but they're not numbers that I would say would be for public consumption. \n What I would say is we feel really good about the trend in auto insurance profitability. As you point out, we got a lot more rates still coming through. We've gotten good control over our expenses. We're working hard on claims to try to deal with a high inflationary environment. Make, sure we keep costs down and not just accept that they have to go up at high single digits. So we feel really good about the trend, at least I don't know that I feel like one quarter makes a trend in that, I would say, this first quarter x percent was due to just some [indiscernible]. Mario, anything you would add to that? I'll let Mario jump in, I know you're probably referring to Klauber's numbers. I'll let Mario jump in on state. But let me just mentioned something, I think kind of we talk about, but I'm not sure if it gets as much focus as I think it should, which is homeowners. The homeowners business is a really attractive business for us. We're really good at it. We have an integrated business model that you can see Mario showed the slide where we've earned a 92 combined ratio over a 10-year period. The industry dynamics today. A lot of that business is sold through independent agents, about half of it.\n And industry dynamics are right for us to leverage that position. There's a great interest in independent agents and having what they call markets or we would call availability. And when you look at why that is, this is -- the first customer risks are increasing, right, whether that's inflation in home values, whether it's demographic trends, people moving in the way of where there's severe weather or just increased severe weather. So there's increased need for risks. And then at the same time, the industry has lost money.\n So the industry lost money over the last 3 years, last 5 years, over the last 10 years, it made money but we made about 3/4 of that money. So the industry made about $10 billion over a 10-year period, and we made about 75% of that. So we're really good at it. And so we think that one of the ways to grow there is in the independent agent channel is by leveraging our homeowners. So we obviously can grow in homeowners in the Allstate agent channel. You see that our bundling stuff, whether you look at any of the industry reports, we're really good at bundling there.\n And you see the PIF growth there even when auto growth is going down, which wasn't always the case. They used to trend more together, but we've got so much better at bundling. So that's -- I don't want to leave homeowners on the cutting-room floor, as it relates to growth, both in the National General channel and the Allstate channel. Mario, do you want to talk about that. We wouldn't break those numbers out for competitive reasons. When it's big enough, so David, you could do math on it. So you could say, okay, here's when the churn is going to come. We would say it. But obviously, there are some markets, we're growing in other markets, we're not growing in. Some of those are markets. Some of those are states. When we get to the point where you can do the math to show when -- I know you -- I totally get where you're going because you want to figure out when the turn is. But we don't like to show what states were growing in at higher rates than others because then they get our competitors interested in going to those states. And we'd rather grow without having them be aware of where we're growing. Let me go up to transformative growth and get Mario to talk about the specifics of your question. So as part of transformative growth, we said we want to improve customer value. And that meant getting our agents to really focus on there were those things that customers really want them to do for them, which includes helping them buy insurance. It doesn't necessarily include having them there when they have to pay a bill for retention.\n They will pay for that, but they won't pay as much as they will for when they get to new business. So we shifted our compensation program to move to lower our cost for customers and better align it with what customers want to pay for. As a result of that, we both lowered distribution expense and we've had some agents who had the word -- had built business models on higher retention [indiscernible]. So our overall agent capacity in the Allstate brand has gone down. That said, to your point, productivity has gone up, and so our overall volume has been even better when you adjust for those 3 states that are not to be named. So Mario, do you want to go there? Yes. The first -- the direct customer does have different needs. So they necessarily want to pay for someone to help them buy insurance, which is why we price our direct insurance under the Allstate brand, cheaper than Allstate-branded insurance bought through an agent. Because we're trying to do exactly what our customers want. They also have different ways they want to interact with us. And so we've -- with our new Transformer growth and new tech stack, it's really everything from what's prepopulated into the thing to the offers it presents to the questions you required to.\n As Mario talked about, we're down 40% in the time. We've been able to add other products to that flow and so increase things like roadside services and sell more products, which lowers our acquisition costs. So it is different. We're good at it, we could be better at it. And so we're working at getting better at it. About 2 years ago, we really reformed the business, put some new leadership in place and then are updating everything from the technology I talked about to also who you market to.\n So you mentioned they're direct, but some of the customers directly, that's where you go to. Like if you go to people who are shopping all time, then you will get higher risk drivers because they shop all the time as opposed to lower risk drivers don't shop as much. So it costs more to get the lower risk drivers on board. So we're working through how do we expand that. We believe that the direct channel has tremendous upside with us to serve those customers who want it that way not just on auto insurance, but things like home insurance and whether it's protection plans or what we're doing in. We get some stuff going on in the commercial space with direct.\n So we think it's just another way the customer would interact. Often -- not a lot of homeowners is sold over direct. We'll see how successful we are. I believe we can. I mean, people buy houses direct. So like if your buyouts or probably buy a home insurance from us. And so there's a great upside. You will notice that when you look over the last couple of years, One of the first places we dialed down new business was in the direct channel. So it was down like 50% or 60%, I think in '23 or something. \n Because we wanted to make sure we maintained our agent force levels of compensation because they have businesses right and this is the revenue that comes into their business. We said, okay, well, this is a temporary window it's easier for us to concentrate that reduction in new business in the direct channel than it is to spread it amongst a bunch of agents who are now also trying to get through a new comp plan. That turned out to be a good choice. It gave us the opportunity to build new capabilities. And now we're hitting the gas side expanding direct. So you should expect to see our direct volume is go up higher as a percentage of new business than it has better in the past. Thank you all for joining us and investing your time in Allstate. We'll talk to you next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Mario. I'm moving to Slide 10, let's discuss the increase in investment income. Before we dig into specifics, let me reiterate that our active portfolio management includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, interest rates and credit spreads by rating, sector and individual names. We seek to optimize return per unit of risk across the enterprise. This approach to portfolio management continued to benefit results in the quarter. Net investment income shown in the chart on the left totaled $764 million in the quarter, which is $189 million above the first quarter of last year.\n Market-based income of $626 million shown in blue was $119 million above the prior year quarter as the fixed income portfolio continues to benefit from repositioning into longer duration and higher yielding assets that have sustainably increased income. Performance-based income of $201 million shown in black was $75 million above the prior year quarter due to higher valuation increases and was above the trend that we have seen in recent quarters but lower than 2022.\n The performance-based portfolio is constructed to enhance long-term returns and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter as expected. Total portfolio return of 0.5% for the quarter and 4.8% for the last 12 months which is shown in the table below the left chart indicates that a balanced approach to risk and return creates shareholder value. The chart on the right shows changes made to the bond portfolio duration in comparison to interest rates over time. Higher income this quarter reflects increases in duration as inter rates rose in 2022 and 2023. The table below the chart shows fixed income portfolio earned yield was 4.1% at quarter end, but 0.7 point increase compared to 3.4% for the prior year quarter.\n Slide 11 breaks down the growth and profit performance of the Protection Service businesses. Revenues in these businesses increased 12.2% to $753 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This result is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans, which increased 20.5% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded product breadth and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $54 million in the first quarter increased $20 million compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to 2 businesses. Profitable growth in Allstate Protection plans resulted in adjusted net income of $40 million, representing an increase of $12 million compared to the prior year quarter, higher revenue and improved claims trends benefited the bottom line. Allstate Roadside had adjusted net income of $11 million, driven by increased pricing, improved provider capacity and lower costs.\n Shifting to Slide 12, the Health and Benefits business continued to perform well. For the first quarter of 2024, revenues of $635 million increased by $52 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by premium growth in individual and group health in addition to higher fees and other revenue in those businesses. Adjusted net income of $56 million in the first quarter was consistent with the prior year quarter as individual health fee income growth was offset by lower employer voluntary benefit income.\n On Slide 13, we'll wrap up our prepared remarks where we started by reiterating Allstate's strategy and opportunities to increase shareholder value; improving auto insurance profitability, pivoting to growing auto and homeowners' policies in force, proactive risk and return management of the investment portfolio, expanding Protection Services and completing the sale of Health and Benefits, which we expect to occur in 2024.\n With that context, let's open up the line for your questions. Jimmy, this is Jesse. So as it relates to the process, I would say things are progressing as expected on the pursuit of the divestiture. You'll remember we announced the intention to pursue the sale about 6 months ago, almost to the day. And as you might expect, there was robust interest from a large group of quality potential buyers on both strategic and financial. So diligence on a large complex business takes some time in so to selecting the right potential buyers to stay involved in the process. At this point, we're pleased with how the process is progressing, and we're confident that we'll be in a position to select a buyer that sees the same potential in the business that we do and is aligned with our strategic rationale for the sale. So we continue to pursue the divestiture as we said. And obviously, we'll let you all know as soon as we have a definitive agreement in place and offer more details at that time. It's a normal process, Elyse. We're not going to go through [indiscernible] it. We still think we'll sell it this year. A lot of people are interested in the business, and we're confident we made the right choice."

            "name": "Mario Rizzo",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's start on Slide 4. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10.9% in the first quarter, driven by higher average premiums. Underwriting income was $89 million, the combined ratio of 93%, which improved by 15.6 points compared to prior year was driven by higher premiums earned, improved underlying loss cost trends, lower catastrophe losses and operating efficiencies. The chart on the right depicts the components of the 93 combined ratio. Lower catastrophe losses of $731 million were 8.8 points favorable to the prior year quarter, reflecting milder winter weather.\n The underlying combined ratio of 86.9% improved by 6.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by higher average premium and moderating loss cost increases. Expense reduction programs also benefited results more than offsetting higher advertising spend. Prior year reserve reestimates, excluding catastrophes, had only a small impact on results. Favorable development in personal auto and homeowners insurance largely offset increases in personal umbrella liabilities and commercial auto reserves for the transportation network contracts we began exiting in late 2022.\n Now let's take a closer look at auto insurance profitability on Slide 5. The first quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 96 improved by 8.4 points compared to the prior year quarter, showing that our profit improvement plan is working. The left chart shows quarterly underlying combined ratios. You will remember, we showed this chart last year, which adjusts 2022 and 2023 quarterly reported figures to reflect the updated average severity estimates as of the end of each respective year. As you can see, the underlying combined ratio improved sequentially in each of the last 5 quarters to 95.1% in the first quarter of 2024.\n The chart on the right shows that in the first half of 2023, premium increases in dark blue were being offset by higher underlying losses and expenses. Profits began to improve in the third quarter of 2023 as premiums outpaced loss and expense increases and this continued in this year's first quarter. The slight first quarter drop in underlying loss and expense reflects lower claim frequency that benefited from milder weather and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher severity.\n Relative to the prior year quarter, average underlying loss and expense in the first quarter of 2024 was 6.7% higher as you can see at the top of the table. This reflects higher current year incurred severity estimates, primarily driven by bodily injury coverage, which was partially offset by lower accident frequency and the favorable impact on current year severity of favorable prior year reserve development in the Allstate brand.\n Given the impact that good weather had on frequency in the quarter, favorable frequency may not persist as the year progresses. While auto margins have improved due to our price improvement actions we remain focused on ensuring that rate levels continue to keep pace with underlying cost trends driving improved profitability in those states not yet achieving target margins.\n Slide 6 shows how auto profit improvement supports pursuing policy growth. As shown on the left, Allstate brand implemented rate increases exceeding 16% in both 2022 and 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we implemented rate increases of 2.4% to keep up with the cost trends and improve margins in states not achieving target margins. The chart on the right depicts the Allstate brand auto proportion of premium in states with an underlying combined ratio of below 96%, shown by the dark blue bars. As more states have achieved target returns, we have started to increase marketing investment, both nationally and in those states. Slide 7 shows that while Allstate brand policies in force decreased compared to prior year, albeit at a slower rate than last quarter, over half that decline was offset by growth at National General.\n On the left, you can see that total protection auto policies in force decreased by 2% and compared to prior year due to a decline of 5.2% in the Allstate brand, reflecting the continued impact of auto insurance profit improvement actions. Underneath this decline is the positive impact of higher Allstate agent productivity and direct channel sales. Customer retention in the Allstate brand also continued to improve, and that improvement has a significant impact on growth trends. Allstate brand auto retention of 86% improved by 0.3 points compared to prior year, as the negative impact of large rate increases in 2022 and 2023 begins to moderate.\n As we discussed last quarter, we received approval for rate increases in the profit challenge states of California, New York and New Jersey, which were affected this quarter. Renewal trends in those states were stable in the first quarter, but the full impact on customer retention had not yet impacted growth. Allstate brand new business also increased 7% versus the prior year, reflecting more advertising and increased Allstate agent productivity and direct sales.\n National General was another positive to growth. Policies in force increased by 12.6% over the prior year due to an increase in nonstandard auto insurance and the continued rollout of a new middle market standard and preferred auto insurance product, also known as Custom360.\n Slide 8 summarizes homeowners insurance profitability, which generated strong returns in the quarter. Homeowners insurance provides a differentiated customer experience and represents an additional growth opportunity across channels. The chart shows the homeowners combined ratio over time, achieving a 10-year average of approximately 92. The first quarter combined ratio of 82.1 translated to $564 million of underwriting income and improved 36.9 points compared to prior year, primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 65.5 also improved by 2.1 points due to higher average premium and lower noncatastrophe claim frequency.\n Allstate Protection homeowners generated double-digit written premium growth compared to prior year, reflecting higher average gross written premium per policy and policies in force growth of 1.4%. Allstate agents continue to bundle auto and homeowners insurance at historically high levels. And National General's Custom360 product offers additional growth opportunities in the independent agent channel. Allstate has created an industry-leading business model, and we remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss the property liability growth opportunities. Starting on the first row. Improving customer retention remains key to improving our growth trajectory. Auto retention levels have stabilized and sequentially improved over the last two quarters and homeowners retention improved 0.8 points to the prior year quarter. Our agents and employees continue to guide customers through the renewal process by offering coverage options and ways to save through innovative programs and discounts like Drivewise and Milewise telematics offerings.\n Growth can also be increased by easing new business restrictions. As rate adequacy has been achieved in more states, restrictive underwriting policies have been unwound in states representing more than 75% of Allstate brand auto premium. Increased Allstate brand advertising is also expected to increase growth. The components of transformative growth are being implemented to create sustainable growth. An improved competitive position will result from further expense reductions.\n Expanded customer access comes from increased Allstate agent productivity, enhanced direct distribution and the expansion of Custom360 to more independent agents. A new Allstate brand, affordable, simple and connected auto insurance product is available in 9 states on the direct sales side. Online quote completion time has been reduced by 40% to less than 3 minutes within the new technology ecosystem. This platform will be expanded to the Allstate agent channel this year into more states and homeowners over the next several years. With these growth levers, Allstate is positioned to generate sustainable, profitable growth.\n Now I'll turn it over to Jesse to talk about other operating results. No, I think that covers it in. The only thing I'd say is in the Allstate brand, obviously, we continue to see the impacts of the profit improvement plan that we've implemented over the last couple of years. But we're starting to see, as Tom mentioned, some positive signs on retention as well as an uptick in production. And first, we need to see sequential growth before we'll get to annual year-over-year growth. And I think it's important to point out in National General. We continue to see really strong growth in that business, along with really strong profitability that we're encouraged by. And we think there's -- most of that growth in National General is coming in the nonstandard auto insurance business, we think there's an additive opportunity that we're going to continue to go after, as I mentioned, with Custom360. So opportunity across all brands and all channels going forward. Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. I guess where I start. First, the good news, as we pointed out, in the presentation as more and more states are achieving rate adequacy. And right now, in about 75% of the states we operate in, we've began to unwind underwriting restrictions. And to your point, begin investing in marketing to look to grow.\n The other thing we've done in anticipation of that opportunity, not only being there, but continuing to expand, is we're organizing ourselves in what we call go-to-market teams that are local market focused that are really intended to drive kind of bottoms-up opportunity, identification and capture again, at the local market level so that we can get the highest possible return on things like the marketing investments we're making, the continued expansion, up distribution as well as the growth opportunity that exists across channels in those states.\n So we're early days in that, but we are putting behind our organization structure to be more focused on local market growth. And you remember, we manage this business state by state, market by market. So having local market insight, intelligence and the ability to move rapidly to capture opportunities is really going to be critical. And we think that alongside the expanded investment we're making in growth, will create significant growth opportunity for us going forward. Yes. So Andrew, I guess the place I'd start is, first of all, we're really happy with the acquisition of National General. As Tom mentioned, we've effectively doubled the size of our independent agent business since we bought it in early 2021. And there's really 3 pieces to the business. There's the nonstandard auto piece, which is the by far the biggest component. And then there's what we call the legacy household business, which is think about our Encompass business that we integrated into it along with the legacy National General Standard Auto, Preferred and home business. And then there's Custom360.\n And Custom360 is the new product offering. We're in about 17 states currently with the intent to expand pretty much into every state by the end of this year or into 2025. And we think that really represents an additive growth opportunity. The product offering itself is built on the Allstate product chassis. So think about the sophisticated rating plans that we have in standard and preferred auto in Allstate, the host and home product that we have in Allstate.\n So those are the products that we're launching in the independent agent channel. And really, to your point, there's a different distribution, a different segment of the independent agent distribution system that we're looking to engage with to really grow that product portfolio. We're early stages. As I said, we're in 17 states. We're really encouraged by the early growth that we're seeing in the states that we've rolled out and more importantly, the agency engagement we're seeing on the IA side. We're going to continue to look to expand on that and leverage that going forward, but we're really optimistic around Custom360 and the opportunity beyond nonstandard auto and the IA channel. Thanks, Greg. This is Mario. I'm going to make some comments off the slide -- off of Slide 5 that we showed you in the presentation, which really shows the -- starts with the average underlying loss and expense trend that we saw in the quarter. That number is about 6.7%. If you take out the expense component, it drops by over 1 point. So I'd say the loss trend we're seeing in the protection business in the mid-5s, and that's made up of both frequency and severity. As we indicated, frequency relative to last year, just given the milder weather was favorable. And then the other component of it is severity. So it's, I'd say, favorable frequency more than offset by higher severity. But severity is continuing to moderate in terms of the rate of increase that we're seeing.\n Maybe a little bit of color underneath severity broadly because really, there's 2 different emerging stories both in physical damage and in injury. And physical damage, we continue to see the benefit of things like lower used car prices. Total loss severity continues to drop. But it continues to cost more to fixed cars, and that's made up of continually increasing parts prices and labor costs. So we've seen increasing severity and physical damage repairable -- for repairable vehicles, but not at the same rate we have been seeing before. That has moderated.\n The real ongoing severity pressure is in beyond the injury side, which continues to run at higher than historical levels. That's driven by a lot of the things we've been talking about, medical treatments, medical consumption, inflation. It's also being driven by the fact that more of our customers continue to get sued and attorney representation levels continue to increase and that's putting pressure on severity. It's also resulting in higher cost for consumers ultimately. The cost to settle injury claims going up at the level that it is translating into higher insurance prices for consumers.\n I'd point out a state like Florida, where last year, they passed meaningful tort reform, and we're starting to see some positive impacts of that tort reform, which I think will bode well for consumers going forward.\n Georgia just -- the Georgia legislature just passed some tort reform, which, again, can be a positive for consumers going forward. And obviously, we're a strong proponent of that kind of reform broadening across more states going forward. But Greg, to your question, positive frequency in the quarter, hard to quantify with any degree of precision what the weather was worth, but it was favorable, offset with severity levels that are running lower than they have been running, but still at positive levels, which is why we're going to stay on top of pricing to make sure that our rates fully reflect loss trends and keep pace with loss trends in the states that we've reopened for growth and continue to pursue rates in states where we haven't achieved target profitability yet. And that would be true both in the Allstate brand and National General. Yes, Greg, it's Mario. I'll just give you a little more color on those 3 states. Remember, last quarter, we told you we had just got an approval in the fourth quarter for auto rate increases in all 3 of those states. In California -- and we implemented those rate increases this past quarter. In California, we feel comfortable of where the rate level is with the increase, and we've reopened California for new business. really no change in New York and New Jersey in terms of our underwriting risk appetite, even with the rate approvals that we got late last year.\n We still don't feel like we're at the appropriate rate level to want to grow in those two states. The only update I'd give you on one of the states is, New Jersey recently approved a 13.9% auto rate increase, which was one of the filings we had pending. That will be effective in the second half of this year. We're still going to need more rate beyond that before we would look to reopen that market. And in New York, we're having ongoing conversations around a pending rate that's with the department, but really nothing new to report at this point. And in those two states, in particular, we have not lifted any of the underwriting restrictions that we have in place. No. Like if you go back to Page 6 that you mentioned that the top bar on the right, the 26%, the vast majority of that is those 3 states: California, New York and New Jersey. And then the -- both the light blue and the dark blue, when you kind of add those together, and we talked about unwinding underwriting restrictions in about 3/4 of the states. Again, we base those decisions on rate adequacy versus kind of a backward-looking combined ratio.\n And we feel good about where we're positioned the growth opportunity, and as we said a couple of times, we're going to stay on top of the loss trend in those states. But the states that are in that top section are the ones that we're going to continue to push incremental rate through because we're not at target margins yet. Yes. I think, Elyse, the components you mentioned are the right ones. And while I can't -- I'm not going to give you the guidance on continually improving loss ratio going forward. What we do know are a handful of things. Number one, we took over 16 points of rate last year and another 2.4 points in the first quarter. That's going to continue to earn through the book, and you're going to continue to see average earned premium growth going forward. That's just based on the actions we've taken so far.\n I talked a little bit about the loss trend earlier and where that was running -- we'll see how that plays out over the duration of the year. The only other piece I'd give you is the frequency component of that, there clearly is a weather benefit we got difficult to quantify. So the frequency benefit may or may not persist going forward. That would be the only thing in addition to just the Q1 seasonality that exists. But we feel good about where the earned premium trend is going and then we're obviously going to watch both components of the loss trend, and we're going to continue to push hard on expenses to drive cost out of the system, which will also help from a margin perspective. Yes. Thanks for the question, Yaron. Look, where I start is the National General nonstandard auto business is a really well-run business for us. And when we acquired NatGen several years ago, it allowed us to get into a business that Allstate was not in at that time in a particularly meaningful way. And we've been able to grow that pretty aggressively and grow it profitably. Over the last several years. Some of the ways we've been able to expand is we've expanded geographically, so we're in a lot more states with nonstandard auto now than when we bought the business. \n We've also expanded from a channel perspective, we allow Allstate agents to sell nonstandard auto through National General for business that's outside of Allstate's risk appetite. We sell it direct to consumer. So we've been able to expand the business, both geographically as well as across channels.\n And the business has been subject to the same inflationary pressures that the standard and preferred auto business has been subject to. But we've stayed on top of rate need. We've taken a lot of rate over the last couple of years, I believe, over 15 points in the last 12 months. So we've stayed on top of the rate need. It's a business that you can effectively reprice most of the book almost every policy period, just given the deflection rates. And we've been able to, over the last couple of years, take advantage of the competitive dislocation in nonstandard auto as a number of carriers have backed off from that business.\n We've taken advantage of that opportunity and taking advantage of by leveraging our capabilities in that space. And as much as the competition might be heating up there, we feel really good about our capabilities, and we're going to continue to look to grow that business as well as the standard preferred and homeowners that Tom talked about with Custom360. Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think the short answer to your question is yes. We -- when you look at overall Allstate brand new business production is up about 6.5%. It was up both in the Allstate exclusive agent channel as well as direct. And then if you kind of carve out California, New York and New Jersey. Because you have to remember, the California rate wasn't effective until February. So we really didn't start opening things back up until the really the latter part of the quarter.\n We're really pleased with how our agents are responding to the changes we've made that Tom talked about continue to invest in their businesses, continuing to drive higher levels of average productivity. And despite the fact that we have fewer agents and have restricted -- or have been restricting grown in 3 pretty significant states.\n Overall productivity is increasing and absolute production is up. So we're really happy with the productivity levels of our agents. And as we look to accelerate growth going forward, they're going to be a core part of how we grow prospectively in addition to things we've been talking about with independent agents and the direct channel."
